    <p>
      Han Sen was worried, as this wasn&#8217;t like before. If his attackers
      were ordinary elites, then the Special Squad would have no issue
      protecting anyone. But the shura he had encountered didn&#8217;t even seem
      human. As such, Han Sen was worried about the safety of his mother if she
      remained out in the shelter.
    </p>

    <p>
      Qin Xuan heard what Han Sen had to say and quickly contacted her
      supervisor, asking where Luo Sulan had gone. She was out in the shelter,
      and members of the Special Squad had escorted her on a hunt.
    </p>

    <p>
      Qin Xuan told Han Sen she had already sent people to find her, and she
      firmly believed it would not be long before they returned.
    </p>

    <p>
      The Blue Crystal shelter was near the Buckda Mountains, and Luo Sulan was
      out on a hunt under the protection of Wu Qinggang. Although she already
      had a lot of geno points, her combat skills and prowess were still
      somewhat lacking. She had not yet even been able to deal with a mutant
      creature. When fighting one, the frustration of watching her fight
      compelled Wu Qinggang to help her finish them off.
    </p>

    <p>
      From what Wu Qinggang could see, women like her were best reserved for
      being of the elegant sort. He thought she would be better off never
      touching a weapon, and instead being waited on, hand-and-foot, by men. He
      thought she should forego the desire for combat and stick to enjoying
      girlier things like flowers and romance.
    </p>

    <p>
      There was no explicit need for her to come out and hunt. With her
      son&#8217;s power and position, he could just keep sending her the flesh
      necessary for her to max out her sacred geno points.
    </p>

    <p>
      But every month, Luo Sulan would request an expedition to go out and hunt.
      She only wanted to kill ordinary mutant creatures, and Wu Qinggang would
      always be fraught with the desire to help her when he watch her try to
      deal with the monsters she sought to fight.
    </p>

    <p>
      A woman such as her, he thought, was not built to fight. Particularly not
      to fight such wretched creatures.
    </p>

    <p>
      Although Wu Qinggang felt this way, he never slacked in his duty to
      protect her. The last thing he wanted was for her to be harmed. He was
      aware that her son was also a member of the Special Squad, but the
      protection of others was a fundamental responsibility of all those who
      wished to be a part of the Special Squad, anyway. Wu Qinggang would give
      his life to assure her security.
    </p>

    <p>
      Suddenly, a roaring sound came from the nearby woods. A black tiger leapt
      out of the brush, fast like a shadow.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;It&#8217;s a sacred-blood creature; a Black-Shadow Tiger! Why has
      it ventured here?&#8221; Wu Qinggang&#8217;s face changed. Black-Shadow
      Tigers tended to reside in the deeper recesses of thick forests and had no
      reason to be anywhere near here.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Missus Han, hide behind me and do not flee.&#8221; Wu Qinggang
      stepped in to eliminate the mutant creature, removing it from the field of
      play. Then, he walked in front of Luo Sulan.
    </p>

    <p>
      Seeing the Black-Shadow Tiger approach, Wu Qinggang drew his longsword and
      ran to meet it. Wu Qinggang could kill sacred-blood Black-Shadow Tigers,
      but doing so would be more difficult while having to protect Luo Sulan at
      the same time.
    </p>

    <p>
      But then, more roaring came from the woods. Things took a turn for the
      worse as another two creatures emerged from the forest. It took Wu
      Qinggang a moment to acknowledge what he was seeing, but when the
      realization struck, it struck hard. His face dropped, watching two more
      sacred-blood creatures emerge from the woods.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Missus Han, ride your sacred-blood mount back to the shelter. I
      will keep them busy.&#8221; Wu Qinggang rushed into battle with the
      Black-Shadow Tiger as he bid for Luo Sulan to escape.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Little Wu, please be careful.&#8221; Luo Sulan summoned the
      sacred-blood mount Han Sen had given her and exited the area with haste.
    </p>

    <p>
      Wu Qinggang&#8217;s sword shone with a blinding light as he fought to buy
      her the time she needed to reach absolute safety.
    </p>

    <p>
      She had reached the bottom of the mountains, not a great distance away
      from the Blue Crystal shelter. Once she had left that place, she would be
      safe.
    </p>

    <p>
      But as Luo Sulan rode her sacred-blood mount, nearing the exit, a dozen
      people appeared in front of her. They barred her passage and surrounded
      her mount.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Missus Han, it would be best if you came with us.&#8221; A leader
      of sorts stepped forward to speak, and as he finished his line, delivered
      a half-smile.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Who are you people? And why should I follow you?&#8221; Luo Sulan
      asked, frightened at their sudden approach.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Do not worry; we do not plan on bringing you harm. We are here to
      bring you reunification with your son,&#8221; the middle-aged man said.
    </p>

    <p>&#8220;What happened to Little Sen?&#8221; Luo Sulan quickly asked.</p>

    <p>
      &#8220;You will know once you come with us,&#8221; the man said, with a
      frosted tone.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;I&#8217;m not going with you,&#8221; Luo Sulan said, as she nibbled
      her lips.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Why do you even bother talking to her? Just capture her
      already!&#8221; another man coldly interjected.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Okay, then,&#8221; the other man then gestured with his hand, and
      the rest approached her.
    </p>

    <p>
      They knew all about Luo Sulan. She was a housewife who killed a few
      ordinary creatures to survive. She has been taken care of through the
      kindness of others, unable to fight for herself.
    </p>

    <p>
      They had already separated her from the assigned protector of the Special
      Squad, which meant capturing her would be an easy task to accomplish.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;You guys have parents; how do you think they would feel if they
      knew you were out here, attempting to kidnap a lone woman?&#8221; Luo
      Sulan sighed as she spoke.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Shut up! If you refuse to come with us peacefully, take one last
      look at that silky-smooth skin of yours, before we cut it up and drag you
      away with us,&#8221; Zhang Fang coldly told her.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;To suffer in the adversity of evil is a nobler deed than to
      helplessly succumb to the brutish requests of those that wish to do you
      harm,&#8221; Luo Sulan said.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Then consider our patience and politeness spent; excuse the rough
      mishandling that may occur next.&#8221; Zhang Fang raised his hand and
      tried to grab Luo Sulan by her hair and pull her off the mount she was
      upon.
    </p>

    <p>
      Just when Zhang Fang&#8217;s hand was about to touch Luo Sulan, she raised
      her silky-smooth hand and casually waved it in front of Zhang Fang&#8217;s
      neck.
    </p>

    <p>Plop!</p>

    <p>
      He was only two feet away, and Zhang Fang&#8217;s head was removed from
      his neck as if it were severed by an invisible knife. The head went a
      great distance, as a trail of blood followed in its airborne wake. The
      eyes were sullen, and seemed to suggest that what had just happened
      wasn&#8217;t fair.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Have any of you ever felt hopeless?&#8221; Luo Sulan&#8217;s face
      was like ice. She did not look scared or afraid, at all. She looked devoid
      of emotion; cold. Just cold.
    </p>

    <p>Their hearts shivered, as chills ran down their spines.</p>

    <p>&#8220;Argh!&#8221;</p>

    <p>
      Blood spread all about like flowers. She quickly moved around, and with
      each directional turn, red syrup followed.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Devil. You are the devil!&#8221; Du Ruzhi was petrified with fear.
      All the elites around him, including Zhang Fang, and two with opened gene
      locks—they most likely had the power to slay or capture a super creature.
    </p>

    <p>
      If they didn&#8217;t possess such power, it would have been impossible for
      them to shake out three sacred-blood creatures to attack and draw away Wu
      Qinggang.
    </p>

    <p>
      But the elites were now mercilessly slain by a woman that only had to walk
      ten quick steps to sever each elite&#8217;s head from their neck.
    </p>

    <p>
      Yet with the claret blood that sprayed and flowed, not a single droplet
      stained the woman&#8217;s clothing. Luo Sulan still looked as elegant and
      as gentle as ever.
    </p>

    <p>
      The woman stood in front of Du Ruzhi, who no longer thought she was a
      pretty woman. She was now the devil.
    </p>

    <p>
      The woman was about to take her last, eleventh step, when Du Ruzhi&#8217;s
      legs seemed to crumble and almost sent him falling to the ground. He
      couldn&#8217;t even think of running away, due to how scary she was. She
      was truly scarier than the devil.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Don&#8217;t&#8230; don&#8217;t kill me&#8230; I still have my
      parents, and I have a wife and kids&#8230;&#8221; Du Ruzhi slobbered his
      plea for mercy, after dropping down to his knees.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;The devil doesn&#8217;t believe in tears.&#8221; Luo Sulan gave Du
      Ruzhi was one last, cold look. She swung her hand, and another head rose
      to the sky with an airborne wake of blood.
