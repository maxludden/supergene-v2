<h2>Thunder God Spike</h2>
<h3>Chapter 2263</h3>

<p>As the sword-like weapon was slowly removed, the mysterious
symbols on its surface began to leap and dance like mad. It looked
as if countless fairies of silver thunder were dancing across
it.</p>
<p>The silver lightning still crackled out of the sword. It was
like there was a silver dragon now flying around the cavern.</p>
<p>Because the lightning was too strong, Han Sen had to fall back
and away from the black kirin’s corpse. Even the blood kirin itself
stumbled back.</p>
<p>The blood kirin was looking very excited. It kept retreating,
but its eyes never left the black kirin’s body.</p>
<p>Little Silver’s lightning was growing to frightening strength.
The hilt of the sword was firmly in the grip of its maw. It forced
the sword completely out of the black kirin’s body.</p>
<p>The sword was only one and a half meters long, but its shape was
very strange. The blade was split into three sections, and each of
its points was sharp. It looked like an army spear.</p>
<p>As he watched the lightning springing from the blade, Han Sen
could immediately tell that the weapon was profoundly special. It
might have been a deified weapon.</p>
<p>Dong! Dong!</p>
<p>Little Silver leaped off of the black kirin’s back. It loosened
its grip on the handle and let the silver sword clatter to the
ground. Then Little Silver let its powerful lightning fox form
dissipate.</p>
<p>Although Little Silver didn’t seem to be injured, it did look
exhausted.</p>
<p>Han Sen quickly picked up Little Silver and offered him one of
the blood pears. Little Silver shook his head at the fruit and lay
down on Han Sen’s chest instead. It closed its eyes, looking very,
very tired.</p>
<p>Upon seeing the silver sword come free of the dead creature, the
blood kirin leaped towards the black kirin’s corpse with exuberant
joy.</p>
<p>“What a sweet creature. All it wanted was for its mother to rest
in peace. It’s rare that I get to see something this touching.” Han
Sen sighed.</p>
<p>The next second, Han Sen’s eyes opened wide. The blood kirin ran
over to the black kirin’s body and used its teeth to rip off a
chunk. The blood kirin tore into the corpse, eating ravenously.</p>
<p>The blood kirin used its claws to tear the body apart, and
viscera and gore flew everywhere as it feasted.</p>
<p>Han Sen froze for a while, his face growing a little pale. His
initial assumpted seemed to have been very wrong. He didn’t know
anymore if the black kirin was indeed the blood kirin’s mother. If
it was, the blood kirin really was a monster.</p>
<p>But that sort of made sense. The blood kirin was born from a
dead body. It had spent its life consuming the White Bone Hell’s
blood bone air. Its very existence had come from death and cruelty.
Eating the corpse of its own mother to gain strength wasn’t out of
the realm of possibility.</p>
<p>It was still an incredibly heartless act, though.</p>
<p>Han Sen was planning to put Bao’er and Little Silver back inside
Destiny’s Tower. If the blood kirin went mad after consuming the
black kirin, they would have to run.</p>
<p>Before he could grab her, Bao’er ran over to the silver sword.
She reached her hand out to grab it before Han Sen could shout a
warning.</p>
<p>When Bao’er’s came down upon it, the blade no longer released
that silver lightning. Bao’er dragged the sword back over to Han
Sen.</p>
<p>“Dad! This sword is awesome. We should take it with us.” Bao’er
held the sword out to Han Sen as she spoke.</p>
<p>Han Sen didn’t dare take the sword, though. Just because Bao’er
hadn’t been electrified, that didn’t guarantee that Han Sen
wouldn’t get shocked.</p>
<p>“Don’t be afraid, Dad! It is fine now. The blade isn’t dangerous
anymore.” Bao’er winked.</p>
<p>“Pfft, why would Dad be afraid? I’m not scared; I’m just
cautious. This is the behavior of a mature man.” Han Sen blushed.
He reached out to take the silver sword.</p>
<p>Just as Bao’er had told him, the sword didn’t crackle with
lightning when he touched it. It really did behave like an ordinary
weapon now.</p>
<p>“Weird. Why has the sword become normal after leaving the black
kirin’s body?” Han Sen looked at the blood kirin still gorging on
the black kirin. He then thought of something. “Maybe the black
kirin’s body triggered the power of the sword? Maybe that is why it
remained active. The electricity kept the blood kirin from eating
the black kirin. It had to have the sword removed first.”</p>
<p>Han Sen didn’t know if his guesses were correct, but it didn’t
matter anymore. Han Sen went to check out the sword. The symbols of
thunder across it were delightful to see. They made the sword look
absolutely beautiful. It didn’t even look like a weapon; it looked
like an art-piece wrought in silver.</p>
<p>After witnessing its power, Han Sen agreed with Bao’er. He
couldn’t tell what level it was, but he was fairly sure that it had
to be a deified weapon.</p>
<p>When he looked at the blade more closely, he noticed that a few
words were engraved on the back of the sword. He was able to read
them. It was of the common language in the geno universe, and it
said, “Thunder God Spike.”</p>
<p>“I think that must be its real name.” Han Sen raised the weapon
carefully in front of him. He tried to put his own power into the
Thunder God Spike, in order to trigger the weapon’s power.
Unfortunately, he could not get it to work.</p>
<p>No matter what power or skill he used, nothing could trigger the
lightning of the Thunder God Spike.</p>
<p>Han Sen decided to use the Dongxuan Sutra to simulate Little
Silver’s lightning power, then he focused that power on the Thunder
God Spike. The lightning symbols of the Thunder God Spike began to
move. They were like silver snakes running up and down the
blade.</p>
<p>But Han Sen’s Dongxuan Sutra was merely Marquise class, so the
lightning power he could simulate wouldn’t be that strong. Only a
small amount of the Thunder God Spike’s power was summoned, but
even so, it was already very strong. It was stronger than if Han
Sen used all of his power with Jadeskin.</p>
<p>“This thing is definitely a deified weapon!” Han Sen felt so
happy. The Thunder God Spike didn’t hurt him when he activated it,
either. That meant he could use the weapon in combat.</p>
<p>Han Sen put the Thunder God Spike into Destiny’s Tower, and
thankfully, it didn’t resist like the Jade Drum had. The Jade Drum
was a living creature, but the Thunder God Spike was just a
weapon.</p>
<p>Han Sen was very lucky to have found the weapon, but it would be
dangerous for him to carry a deified treasure in plain view. Unless
it was direly necessary, Han Sen planned to keep the weapon hidden
from anyone who might want to steal it.</p>
<p>Han Sen put Bao’er and Little Silver back into Destiny’s Tower.
The blood kirin was still eating the black kirin’s body. It was a
small creature, but its stomach was large. The black kirin’s body
was like a mountain, but a big chunk of it had already
disappeared.</p>
<p>The blood kirin ate its fill and grunted in satisfaction. Then
it moved back and made a rumbling noise to get Han Sen’s attention.
It tossed its head at the black kirin’s body, as if it was inviting
Han Sen to eat.</p>
<p>“It’s fine. You can eat it.” Han Sen shook his head. His body
was already filled with unprocessed Ghost Bone power, so it didn’t
matter what he ate right now.</p>
<p>But the blood kirin’s invitation was still reassuring. The beast
didn’t seem like it was ever going to be hostile to him.</p>
