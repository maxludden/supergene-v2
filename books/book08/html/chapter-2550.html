<h2>Shura Horn</h2>
<h3>Chapter 2550</h3>

<p>Greyish white feathers appeared, cloaking Han Sen’s body. The
image of a rainbow peacock appeared on his face, and it released a
scary rainbow light. That rainbow light quickly melted away the Sky
Demon Lock’s purple smoke. In seconds, the power holding Han Sen in
place had vanished.</p>
<p>Ji Yang Sheng and the other Demons were shocked when they saw
this. Their Sky Demon Lock, which could securely ensnare a deified
being, had just been melted away with ease. It was unbelievable,
and as a result, they were left staring in stupefied silence.</p>
<p>They looked at Han Sen’s feathery clothing, unsure what sort of
treasure he was now making use of. But whatever it was, it was
obviously strong enough to break the Sky Demon Lock.</p>
<p>Their assumption was only half-right. Han Sen had been able to
break free of the Sky Demon Lock because of the Peacock King soul
robe’s power, but the beast soul alone wouldn’t have been enough to
free him. Even if the Tianxia Peacock King was reborn, it couldn’t
have broken the Sky Demon Lock.</p>
<p>But when the Peacock King’s soul power, Han Sen’s strength, and
the power of the Dongxuan Sutra were combined, the resultant power
was enough to shatter the Sky Demon Lock. Nothing less than that
would have been able to free Han Sen.</p>
<p>Han Sen hadn’t used the Peacock King soul robe at first because
he knew there was something amiss with the armored man. He wanted
to see who or what was behind the armored man, and that was why he
allowed himself to get captured.</p>
<p>Now he understood everything, and there was no point in
pretending.</p>
<p>Ji Yang Sheng’s eyes widened. He didn’t say anything, but he
poured more Sky Demon power into the purple horn that was still in
his hands.</p>
<p>The armored man’s eyes glowed purple once more. He tried to grab
Han Sen’s head again.</p>
<p>Han Sen waved his hand, and a rainbow light struck the armored
man. The armored man’s body lost control and fell prone. The
rainbow light covered his whole body, and the power of the light
quickly dissolved the black armor, revealing the person inside.</p>
<p>It was a very muscular man. He was much taller than Han Sen. He
wasn’t very tall compared to many of the giant races in the
universe, but his body was so solid that his limbs looked like
towers. Tattoos covered his entire body.</p>
<p>Han Sen could see that these tattoos were shura-associated. Han
Sen had rarely seen shuras with those kinds of symbols, though.
They were different from the traditional Demon tattoos.</p>
<p>Han Sen raised his eyes and looked at the man’s head. To his
surprise, the man’s head didn’t possess shura horns. His head was
only covered in short purple hair.</p>
<p>But in that short hair, Han Sen could see an oval-shaped
marking. It looked the man had once possessed a horn, but it had
been broken off.</p>
<p>“It really is one of the shura,” Han Sen thought to himself.</p>
<p>The guy was emotionless, and his muscles bulged so much that
they looked like they were about to burst. The purple air rose, and
it came at Han Sen in another attack. Han Sen immediately detected
the Sky Demon power.</p>
<p>“Are the Sky Demon Sutra and the Falsified-Sky Sutra the same?
But if there is practically no difference between them, doesn’t
that mean pure shuras shouldn’t be able to learn it? If he is a
shura king from the sanctuary, how could he practice Sky Demon
powers?” Han Sen wondered.</p>
<p>The man’s fist came before Han Sen, but Han Sen raised his hand
to stop it. Han Sen’s hand was enshrouded with a rainbow godlight
formed by substance chains. The rainbow godlight quickly tied up
his enemy’s body.</p>
<p>The man struggled and writhed inside his bonds. Sky Demon power
was strong, but it could only make use of causal powers. It wasn’t
some invincible ability. And speaking of power, this creature
wasn’t quite deified yet. He was weaker than the soul robe’s
power.</p>
<p>If the shura had been fighting someone other than Han Sen, he
could have used causal powers to escape. But Han Sen was using his
Dongxuan Area in conjunction with the Peacock King’s soul robe. The
Dongxuan Area’s force stopped all of the universal cogwheels in the
region. Not even causal powers could escape Han Sen’s manipulation.
Unless the shura was stronger than Han Sen, the shura’s powers
weren’t going to be of any use while Han Sen had his Dongxuan Area
active.</p>
<p>Ji Yang Sheng and the other Demons were in shock. The Demon
Doll’s power was almost deified class, and Demon Dolls weren’t like
ordinary Demons. They had very scary talents. After they became
Demon Dolls, they would undergo a weird reaction with the Sky Demon
powers. The Demon Dolls would then gain causal powers, which would
allow them to apply causal powers to a wide range of uses. Not even
a pure Demon could do that.</p>
<p>Even deified elites couldn’t trap a Demon Doll. But now, the
Demon Doll had been subdued by Han Sen, and it seemed completely
unable to break free. It was being held tightly by Han Sen’s power.
The entire situation was way too scary.</p>
<p>Without hesitation, Ji Yang Sheng turned around with the plan to
run away as fast as he could. The other Demon elites thought to do
the same. But they suddenly noticed their powers had disappeared.
None of their abilities seemed to work. They couldn’t tear through
the fabric of space. They couldn’t even cast any powers outside of
their bodies.</p>
<p>“What’s going on?” Ji Yang Sheng and the other Demons looked at
each other with wide, frightened eyes.</p>
<p>“Let me deal with them,” Elysian Moon said smoothly. She waved
her paper umbrella, unleashing a swordlight. It flew right at Ji
Yang Sheng.</p>
<p>Due to the fact that they couldn’t use their powers, Ji Yang
Sheng and the others had to jerk clumsily away. But with their
reaction times being so slow, they couldn’t dodge many of the
swordlights, and the cruel attacks began to punch through their
bodies. Demon blood gushed everywhere as they screamed.</p>
<p>A second later, a few of the Kings had already perished under
Elysian Moon’s swordlights. Ji Yang Sheng and the other two
half-deifieds were badly injured.</p>
<p>Now they believed what Han Sen had said. That woman was so
pretty, but she was also someone who could slaughter her enemies
without so much as a blink of hesitation. They were shocked by how
powerful she was.</p>
<p>They were under the influence of Han Sen’s Dongxuan Area. They
couldn’t use their powers, even though they could still touch their
self-cogwheels. Their power was there, but they couldn’t make use
of it. They couldn’t do anything to save themselves.</p>
<p>That woman’s area power was no greater than King class, but her
swordlights could pierce through the bodies of half-deifieds. Just
that power exceeded what an ordinary King could accomplish.</p>
<p>Ji Yang Sheng was as shocked as he was angry. He hated the fact
that he hadn’t followed the Demon King’s advice.</p>
<p>“Han Sen, I’m the son of the Demon Alpha. If you kill me, the
Demons will do all they can to avenge my death. If you let me go,
you can take any deified treasure and xenogeneic genes you wish,”
Ji Yang Sheng shouted.</p>
<p>Han Sen looked at Ji Yang Sheng and said, “A Demon? You’re lowly
compared to the Extreme King.”</p>
<p>When he heard that, Ji Yang Sheng’s face turned grey. He
remembered that Han Sen was the one who had killed a prince of the
Extreme King. If he wasn’t concerned about their wrath, why would
he fear the Demons?</p>
<p>Han Sen reached out, and a rainbow light shot from his palm. Ji
Yang Sheng didn’t have the time or strength to dodge it. The purple
horn was taken by Han Sen.</p>
<p>Han Sen ignored Ji Yang Sheng and the others getting killed by
Elysian Moon’s swordlights. He took the mysterious purple horn and
lifted it next to the broken stub on the shura man’s head.</p>
<p>“It is his horn.” Han Sen thought about it and wondered what had
happened.</p>
