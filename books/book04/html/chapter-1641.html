    <p>
      After Bao’er sucked up all the black and purple smoke, she grabbed
      Littleflower and hit the wall behind them. However, when they broke
      through the wall, there was another invisible wall blocking them, and
      Bao’er and Littleflower bounced back again.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bao’er’s eyes spun, and she stomped on the ground, kicking a large hole in
      the floor. Suddenly, the supermarket on the first floor was visible.
      However, they didn’t fall through the hole in the floor as there seemed to
      be an invisible screen holding Bao’er and Littleflower back.
    </p>
    <p>
      There were people walking down there in the supermarket, and nobody
      noticed the large hole above them. They were still walking and buying
      stuff as nobody noticed what was happening.
    </p>
    <p>
      “As I’ve told you, it’s useless. You can’t get out of my Sen Luo
      illusion.” The woman looked at Bao’er with interest. “You’re indeed a
      fascinating pet, but sadly, I don’t have time now. If Han Sen comes back,
      things will get more complicated. So back off. Otherwise, I’ll kill you
      know. You’re really cute, and it’ll be a shame to kill you now. Even if
      I’m gonna kill you, it should be on the dining table.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Sister, why do you want Littleflower? He doesn’t even have as much flesh
      as I do. If you want to eat flesh, you can just take me,” said Bao’er,
      blinking her eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      The woman sneered without saying anything more. Black and purple smoke
      began to waft from her again, and this time, it didn’t attack Bao’er and
      Littleflower. Instead, it rolled down her own body.
    </p>
    <p>
      The smoke quickly covered the lady’s body, then twisted and condensed.
      Gradually, it formed a heavy purple and black crystal armor, making the
      woman look like a robot.
    </p>
    <p>Hong!</p>
    <p>
      After donning that black and purple crystal armor, the woman stepped out
      again. Her body tore apart the space around her, and she ran toward Bao’er
      and Little Flower.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bao’er was dazed. She dragged Littleflower backwards, but they couldn’t
      dodge the woman’s palm. Bao’er saw that the woman’s hand was about to grab
      Littleflower’s shoulder.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bao’er grabbed Littleflower abruptly, clenched her fist, and punched the
      woman’s palm.
    </p>
    <p>Peng!</p>
    <p>
      Bao’er bounced away immediately, and she hit the invisible boundary. There
      was blood coming out of her mouth.
    </p>
    <p>
      The woman didn’t give a d*mn about Bao’er; instead, she reached toward
      Littleflower again.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bao’er clenched her teeth and climbed up from the ground. She rushed
      toward Littleflower again and defended against the woman’s palm with the
      gourd.
    </p>
    <p>
      “I’ll kill you if you want to die!” The woman was kind of infuriated. Her
      hand that was covered by her purple and black crystal armor clenched into
      a fist, and she hit the gourd.
    </p>
    <p>Peng!</p>
    <p>
      Bao’er bounced away and hit the boundary again. There was still blood
      coming out of her mouth, but with the gourd as a buffer, she wasn’t
      injured like last time. Bao’er climbed up quickly again, and she stood in
      front of Littleflower, glaring at the woman.
    </p>
    <p>
      The woman didn’t hesitate at all. She kept punching, and Bao’er kept using
      her gourd to ward off the attacks. Her small body kept bouncing away, yet
      every time, she rushed back.
    </p>
    <p>Kacha!</p>
    <p>After being hit several times, cracks appeared on Bao’er’s gourd.</p>
    <p>
      Bao’er clenched her teeth and went back to Littleflower, and facing the
      woman’s fist, she grabbed her gourd and rushed toward. Then the gourd was
      smashed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bao’er spewed blood out everywhere, and her face turned pale immediately.
      The smashing of the gourd seemed to be a huge blow to her.
    </p>
    <p>
      She climbed up from the ground again, and there was blood everywhere on
      her body, and she couldn’t even walk straight anymore. However, she still
      went back to Littleflower and opened her arms, standing in front of her
      little brother.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Impressive. A demigod pet can take so many of my punches. However, this
      is your last chance, because I’ll kill you this time.” The woman raised
      her fist, and there was still smoke all around the black and purple armor.
      It looked like the hand of a devil, emanating terrifying force.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bao’er stared at the woman’s fist and said coldly, “He’s my father’s son,
      and he’s my brother. Nobody can harm him in front of me.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Really?” the woman sneered, and the terrifying fist tore the space apart.
      It hit Bao’er, and the force seemed to be able to destroy the entire
      world.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bao’er was waving her fist, and she rushed toward the woman’s attack
      again.
    </p>
    <p>Peng!</p>
    <p>
      Bao’er flew out like a star again, and her body hit the invisible
      boundary. There was the sound of bone cracking, and the blood in her mouth
      opened like a flower, and her body fell on the ground.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bao’er tried to stand up again, and after struggling several times, she
      wasn’t able to do so. One of her arms had been broken and twisted into a
      weird shape. She couldn’t use her power.
    </p>
    <p>
      The woman looked at Bao’er who was half dead already. She didn’t want to
      waste any time. She reached toward Littleflower beside her.
    </p>
    <p>
      “I’ve told you. Don’t touch Littleflower.” A sound came from beside her,
      and it was Bao’er.
    </p>
    <p>
      The woman turned around and saw Bao’er kneeling on the ground, struggling
      to hold herself there. She was trying to stand up, but she just couldn’t
      do it.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Then come and stop me,” said the woman disdainfully. She didn’t give a
      d*mn about Bao’er, and she tried to grab Littleflower.
    </p>
    <p>
      Littleflower looked at the shadow of the hand that was reaching toward his
      head, cloaked with that black and purple armor that looked like a devil.
      He then cried, and there were tears dropping from his eyes.
    </p>
    <p>Hong!</p>
    <p>
      The woman had almost grabbed Littleflower when a terrifying force rose
      beside her. She suddenly felt that she was in extreme danger. She reacted
      quickly and backed off a little bit.
    </p>
    <p>
      She looked around, and she saw Bao’er standing up from the ground.
      However, the space around her was already twisted, so the woman couldn’t
      see her body straight.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Inexcusable… Inexcusable… You made Littleflower cry… Inexcusable…” Bao’er
      raised her head and glared at the woman. Her eyes were gleaming with
      terrifying light as if she were a ghost from hell.
    </p>
    <p>
      The woman was intimidated. She couldn’t help taking some steps back, and
      then she realized what she was doing. She said to herself with contempt,
      “It’s just a demigod-level pet. I was actually intimidated by that. I’ve
      been comfortable for too long.”
    </p>
    <p>
      She turned to Bao’er. “I thought you were interesting, so I wanted to
      spare your life so that you could tell Han Sen what happened. Since you
      really want to die, I’ll satisfy your wish.”
    </p>
    <p>
      The woman then condensed the power in her fist, and she threw it toward
      Bao’er.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Only I can bully him, yet you made him cry… You deserve to die…” Bao’er
      glared at that woman as if she didn’t see the fist with the terrifying
      force. She became more and more belligerent, and anyone who saw those
      ghostly eyes would have been scared.
