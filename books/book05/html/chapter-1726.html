	<p>Now Han Sen understood why Qiao had bought him. With that dagger, you could kill xenogeneics even if you weren’t
		a Noble.</p>

	<p>Still, it wouldn’t work if given to the average soldier. They lacked the speed and physical prowess to match a
		xenogeneic, and they would likely end up killed before ever getting a chance to use the weapon.</p>

	<p>Qiao must have studied the fight between Han Sen and the xenogeneic and determined he was capable enough to wield
		the dagger effectively. It was the reason why she had bought him.</p>

	<p>“So pieces of xenogeneics can become weaponry?” Han Sen asked as he fiddled with the Rhino Horn Dagger.</p>

	<p>“There are many different xenogeneic materials, and most can be used to create weapons,” Qiao answered without
		even having to think.</p>

	<p>“Can we eat them?” Han Sen smiled, as if he was joking.</p>

	<p>Qiao shook her head and said, “I have never heard of an edible xenogeneic material. And who would want to?
		Unstable genes can affect the genes of your entire body. Most ordinary people wouldn’t even be able to digest
		them. Some xenogeneic materials can be used for medicine, however.”</p>

	<p>Han Sen was confused when he heard that. If nobody could consume xenogeneic genes, how was he able to? And the
		stuff had melted through a simple boiling process.</p>

	<p>Han Sen wanted to see if he could cook the rhino dagger and eat it. Unfortunately, he knew it didn’t truly belong
		to him, so he shelved the idea.</p>

	<p>He looked over the contract Qiao gave him, and one of the terms said the dagger would be lent to him for the
		duration of his time in Wizard. If he ever left the team, he would have to give it back.</p>

	<p>Han Sen signed it without hesitation. He had to work with Wizard for the next two years, and for the time being,
		that weapon was perfect.</p>

	<p>It was only after Han Sen became a part of Wizard that he realized the team was all sorts of bad.</p>

	<p>The training base had been sold, and the dilapidated old house they were standing in had become their new base.
		It was all that Qiao had.</p>

	<p>And the only other member of the team who was an old woman who had raised Qiao. She was in charge of housework,
		most of the time.</p>

	<p>That meant the only real members of Wizard were Han Sen and Qiao.</p>

	<p>“Can the two of us slay xenogeneics?” Han Sen asked.</p>

	<p>They had no one to assist them, so there was the whole matter of even finding a xenogeneic. Even if they knew
		where one was, they might not be able to force it out</p>

	<p>Xenogeneics were faster than ordinary creatures, and they were very good at hiding. That’s why most teams used so
		many people to hunt for them.</p>

	<p>“I have thought about this. The xenogeneics are evil, but they won’t risk anything unless they are confident. If
		a Noble was out hunting them, there is a chance they would not dare strike. You are different, however; you
		aren’t a Noble, and there’s every possibility they’d relish the chance to try to attack you.” Before Qiao could
		finish, Han Sen understood what she was getting at.</p>

	<p>Han Sen slumped his shoulders. “What kind of resource will I need to harvest for the production of a weapon?”</p>

	<p>“You need the right materials, and you have to find an expert to forge it for you. They are difficult to produce,
		so you’d need to enlist the service of a genuine professional. Otherwise, the weapon you produced might not even
		function properly. I hear 30% is the usual percentage for success in forging, due to the instability of the base
		resource. My father used up many resources through the years in forging endeavors, but he was only ever able to
		successfully craft this dagger,” Qiao said.</p>

	<p>“When should we go hunt?” Han Sen asked, as he needed xenogeneic genes now.</p>

	<p>“I have been looking for a xenogeneic. For the time being, you should rest. I will find us one before long.” Qiao
		escorted Han Sen to a room that was to be his private place.</p>

	<p>“This place isn’t all that bad. It’s better than Black Gold, leastways.” Han Sen was satisfied.</p>

	<p>Although he needed to share half his rewards with Qiao, Qiao did all the mental heavy-lifting. Searching for
		information and scouring for reports was what she did, and it was something Han Sen couldn’t</p>

	<p>Without help in such matters, Han Sen wouldn’t be able to find any himself. And if he couldn’t find xenogeneics,
		he couldn’t kill xenogeneics.</p>

	<p>And Qiao had given him the Rhino Horn Dagger, too. Now Han Sen could kill xenogeneics with greater ease. It was
		more than right to give her half the loot.</p>

	<p>The Nine-Life Cat was also a liability, since it didn’t always work. He couldn’t put his faith in it After
		killing the xenogeneic, Han Sen had tried to active the Nine-Life Cat tattoo again but couldn’t</p>

	<p>When Qiao left him to settle in, Han Sen locked the door and made sure no one was watching before he brought out
		his pot. He put the ten blue metal claws inside, to cook them.</p>

	<p>The second day, when Han Sen opened the pot, he had to hold his nose.</p>

	<p>The water in the pot had turned to something that looked like swirling blue ink. It had a pungent stench.</p>

	<p>Han Sen used his spoon to give it a good stir, and he noticed all the nails had been melted away.</p>

	<p>“Weird. If the xenogeneic materials can melt this easily, the people here should know. There’s no way they can be
		used for weapons. Something is most certainly wrong with all this, but what that is exactly, I can’t say.” Han
		Sen frowned. He couldn’t figure out what was going on.</p>

	<p>There was nothing unusual about the pot or the water, so the problem had to lie with Han Sen. But Han Sen did not
		know what he had done to cause the ingredients to change in such a way.</p>

	<p>Han Sen drank the blue juice, and he immediately noted how different it was to the bone juice. It wasn’t even
		hot—it was actually cold! It felt like he was freezing his own bones when he drank it.</p>

	<p>“Consumed a Baron Xenogeneic Gene. Baron Gene +1”</p>

	<p>Han Sen’s head began to emit a white mist. His hair and eyebrows were covered by a thick layer of frost, and his
		teeth began to chatter.</p>

	<p>Han Sen had to cast skills for over an hour in order to recover.</p>

	<p>The ten nails had only provided him a single gene, so Han Sen frowned. It seemed that it did not matter how much
		of the material was consumed.</p>

	<p>He stayed there for the next two days, and eventually, Qiao called Han Sen with a quest.</p>

	<p>When Han Sen entered the car next, Lan Se was in the passenger seat “Han Sen, we meet again.” Lan Se smiled.</p>

	<p>“Officer Lan, why are you here? Are you a part of this quest?” Han Sen asked.</p>

	<p>Lan Se smiled and said, “Remember the xenogeneic that murdered the factory workers? You guys are going to kill
		it. I hope you don’t wind up dead.”</p>
