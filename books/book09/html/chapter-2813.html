<h2>Too Weak</h2>
<h3>Chapter 2813</h3>

<p>Everyone was shocked. Meng Lie was already a larva class
deified, and he had turned a larva-class black-scaled, nine-headed
snake into a gold soldier. Even so, he was not able to deflect one
small strike. How scary could that power be?</p>
<p>“Impossible… You are not Han Sen…” Meng Lie was shaking and
shivering as he emerged from the scrap heap. His hands were full of
blood, but he did not care. He stared at the young man and spoke
directly to him.</p>
<p>“Oh? Why am I not Han Sen? Is it because I did not use Under the
Sky Knife skills? If you would like to watch me perform them, I can
show you.” The young man looked at Meng Lie with interest.</p>
<p>Almost at the same time, his body had an Under the Sky skill
play out. The scary mind suddenly covered everything around. Even
Second Uncle’s face changed while witnessing it. His will was
affected by the strength of that mind. It gave him a strange and
unsettling feeling. It was like they had all become puppets. If
that man wanted to, he could change their fates in the blink of an
eye.</p>
<p>Han Sen finally noticed the young man’s knife mind was similar
to his Under the Sky Knife skills, but it was a bit different. The
young man’s knife mind was more like the Very High mind. It was
like he was the person who played chess. Everything was a chess
piece, and the pieces were in his hands.</p>
<p>It was like Han Sen’s mind, but he used himself as a chess
piece. He was not the one who controlled the game of chess. The
young man’s mind was strong, and he was in no way inferior to him.
He was a bit shocked that the young man might very well be the
smartest person in the world. He just did not have a clue why he
had disguised himself as Han Sen.</p>
<p>“You are not Han Sen,” Meng Lie stubbornly repeated. He stared
at the young man intently.</p>
<p>“Oh? Are you saying this because I have proven myself to be too
strong and he is not that strong?” the young man coldly asked.</p>
<p>Hearing the young man say that, everyone understood how Meng Lie
was correct. That young man was not Han Sen.</p>
<p>“No. You have sensed it differently. Although you wear his face,
you cannot copy his presence. You are not Han Sen.” Meng Lie
gnashed his teeth as he asked, “So, who are you?”</p>
<p>“You are right,” the man coldly said. “Han Sen is just a small,
lowlife creature. It does not matter how I try to disguise myself
as him. I still cannot get a hold of his cheap presence.”</p>
<p>Second Uncle’s face changed. He looked at the young man and
said, “If you are not Han Sen, then we are not your enemy. This was
all just a big misunderstanding. How about we stop fighting
now?”</p>
<p>The young man lifted his lips, smiled, and asked, “Did I not
just tell you that from now on, you must all listen to my command?
If you perform your duties well, I might be inclined to spare your
lives.”</p>
<p>“You really are powerful, but if we got into a real fight, there
is no guarantee you can win. Why not be friends instead of enemies?
This time, you offended us. If you stop now, you can become an ally
of the Extreme King.” Second Uncle’s power was stronger than Meng
Lie’s, but he was not a person who sorted out problems via simple
force. He also did not think he could beat that mysterious man in
front of him.</p>
<p>After listening to Second Uncle, the young man’s face broke into
an even bigger smile. “In the eyes of the lowlife creatures, the
Extreme King might sound like stalwart allies. For someone like me,
through my god eyes, the Extreme Kings of the universe are just as
much of lowlives as all the others. They do not have what it takes
to negotiate with the likes of me, who is a god.”</p>
<p>Who is this guy? He is very cocky. He does not spare the Extreme
King a second thought. Han Sen did not speak. He just looked at the
young man.</p>
<p>“You are too cocky.” Second Uncle was furious. There was no way
he was going to let the young man’s attitude fly.</p>
<p>Many weird shockwaves came out of Second Uncle’s body. The
shockwaves were shapeless and colorless, but once could see the
shockwaves ripple through space. They created a special area for
Second Uncle’s body.</p>
<p>Han Sen was slightly shocked. The power Second Uncle used seemed
to be like a time power. It was a very rare element.</p>
<p>“Time element? That is very rare, but you are too weak.” The
young man stood up from the stone platform. In the next moment, he
was flying toward Second Uncle.</p>
<p>It was just one step, yet he was already before Second
Uncle.</p>
<p>Second Uncle’s eyes had a god light in them. The time power in
his body quickly spun. It twisted the space around. It was like the
area Han Sen was in. Time was slowing down. Everyone there was
moving in slow motion.</p>
<p>Even Bao Qin’s screaming had been slowed down many times. His
mouth was open, but he could not make a sound for a long time.</p>
<p>Pang!</p>
<p>The young man was not at all affected. His hands pressed down on
Second Uncle’s head, but Second Uncle’s legs went soft. He knelt
before the young man.</p>
<p>Everybody was unable to believe what they were seeing. The
butterfly Second Uncle, who had a time king body, had been
suppressed into a kneel by one hand. How strong was that power?</p>
<p>Second Uncle was extremely mad. He had never been humiliated
like this before. The power in him quickly exploded. He wanted to
break the young man’s power.</p>
<p>No matter how he exploded, the young man was still as stable as
Tarzan. His hands were still holding onto Second Uncle’s head, so
that is where Second Uncle continued to kneel.</p>
<p>“I told you. Your time power element is strong, but you are
still too weak for the likes of me. Lowlife creatures really are
lowlife creatures. You have powerful element powers, but you can
exercise the full potential of such strength.” The young man was
acting like he was teaching a junior. He made Second Uncle’s face
burn red.</p>
<p>Although Second Uncle was angry, he could not break the young
man’s suppressing power. It made him feel terrible. His anger
continued to grow.</p>
<p>“Let’s go!” Meng Lie roared. He picked up the broken, gold,
nine-headed trident. The gold god light on him exploded like a
tsunami. It was going toward the young man.</p>
<p>Ger, Londo, Bao Qin, Bao Ying, and all the deified elites used
their strongest powers. They were all going to attack the young man
at the same time. They wanted to use this chance while the young
man was dealing with Second Uncle. Now was the time to damage
him.</p>
<p>The young man looked disdained. One of his hands held onto
Second Uncle, but he did not move. He shone with a god light. He
was like a god light surrounded by a god light from a halo.</p>
<p>Pang!</p>
<p>All kinds of scary powers struck the halo, but they could not
break it.</p>
<p>“Let me give you one last chance. If you still do not listen,
your lives are worthless and you don’t deserve to live,” the young
man said. His body exploded with god light. It blew away Meng Lie
and the other deifieds.</p>
<p>Seeing the deifieds elites that fell, Han Sen was shocked. He
thought, Who is this guy? Is he a true god class elite? Why did he
disguise himself as me? Is he a friend or foe?</p>
