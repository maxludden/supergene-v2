<p>“That woman is annoying.” Han Sen still didn’t like Fox
Queen.</p>
<p>If Han Sen’s identity was exposed, it wouldn’t benefit Fox Queen
in any way. She didn’t seem like the type to harm others if she
wasn’t going to get anything out of it.</p>
<p>But Han Sen couldn’t apply normal logic when trying to predict
Fox Queen’s behavior. She was a Fox, and she had been imprisoned
for eons. No one could be certain how she would act.</p>
<p>Han Sen thought about it some more. He had some people he could
use. After he returned to Underwater Town, he brought out his Siren
Bottle and tapped the left side of it three times. A rainbow fired
out of the bottle, then turned into a shadowy shape that slowly
composed itself as the Siren Virgin.</p>
<p>Han Sen told her that he had been threatened by Fox Queen. The
Siren Virgin looked unconcerned. She calmly said, “Fox Queen won’t
sell you out, but if you can reach the top three in the exams and
gain access to Destiny’s Tower, that would be a considerable
reward.”</p>
<p>“My identity could be exposed any second. Why would I do
something to draw so much attention?” Han Sen bore a wry smile.</p>
<p>The Siren Virgin laughed. “Your situation is not as precarious
as you believe. King Bai did grow suspicious of you, but if he
wants to investigate you, there are only three ways he can do that.
First, he could summon you directly. But I don’t think he’s
confident that seeing you would help. He never liked Bai Yi much as
a son, anyway, so they only rarely met. I actually don’t think he
could tell if you were Bai Yi or not. The second method would be to
investigate you through Miss Mirror. For other people, that would
be the most difficult means of detection to avoid, but for you, it
would most likely be the easiest.”</p>
<p>“Why?” Han Sen cocked his head as he looked at the Siren Virgin.
He had never told her the story of his time with Miss Mirror, so he
didn’t know what had led the Siren Virgin to this conclusion.</p>
<p>The woman pointed at Han Sen’s finger and the ring that was on
it. “You are wearing the Mirror Spirit Eye Ring. You are Miss
Mirror’s hope. Why would she go and destroy her own hope?”</p>
<p>“Hope? What are you talking about?” Han Sen felt sudden pleasure
as he realized that the Siren Virgin seemed to know something about
this.</p>
<p>The Siren Virgin smiled kindly. “Miss Mirror is called Miss
Mirror because she has a Mirror Spirit King Body. That body
provides her with a mirroring ability. She can use her mirror body
on an elite, and the stronger the elite becomes, the more she
benefits.”</p>
<p>“This ring is Miss Mirror’s mirror body?” Han Sen looked at the
ring on his finger with astonishment.</p>
<p>The Siren Virgin nodded and said, “Yes. Mirror body can only be
used once. If the mirror body becomes solid and falls into someone
else’s hands, then Miss Mirror loses control of it. The new owner
would benefit from the mirror body instead. Miss Mirror was quite
well-known among the Extreme King for her beauty and intelligence.
In her youth, that is. The name Princess Mirror was a very famous
one. Many young nobles wanted to marry her, but she was too proud
to submit to being in someone’s shadow. She didn’t look up to any
of her peers. In the end, she did marry someone, but it was a young
outsider. She put the mirror body into a Mirror Spirit Eye Ring and
sent it to the young outsider.”</p>
<p>After pausing, the Siren Virgin went on to say, “That handsome
young man didn’t disappoint Miss Mirror. He was a Duke, and he
leveled up fast with Miss Mirror’s help. Within a hundred years, he
had become deified. He caused a big fuss amongst the Extreme King,
but sadly, he was killed in a fight, and the Mirror Spirit Eye Ring
was lost. I would never have expected it to be in your
possession.”</p>
<p>“So, you are saying that when I wear this ring, Miss Mirror can
gain something from me? What is she taking?” Han Sen asked
apprehensively.</p>
<p>The Siren Virgin laughed. “Don’t worry. The mirror body requires
your willpower and intent to function properly. Plus, the
information can only be swapped when the two mirror bodies are in
close proximity. You must have noticed that Miss Mirror had a ring
that was similar to yours. You have to be close together for both
of the rings to send messages. And the messages go both ways. You
can learn what Miss Mirror’s thoughts are. That was why that young
man was able to level up so fast. To have gained the ring as a Duke
while Miss Mirror is already deified, you’re either very skilled or
very lucky. Her level is much higher than yours.”</p>
<p>“She can’t just take the ring back and give it to another
person, can she?” Han Sen wondered.</p>
<p>“It would be much easier for her if the ring could be
transferred that simply. However, once the ring has been taken by
an outsider, she cannot control it. Since you are wearing the
Mirror Spirit Eye Ring, that means you have received the mirror
body’s approval. If you die, the mirror body will be damaged. Last
time she lost the ring, when a deified died, it must have dealt a
fair amount of damage to Miss Mirror’s mirror body. I doubt she
wants to go through that again. Otherwise, she would have already
killed you and taken the Mirror Spirit Eye Ring back for herself.
After all, while you are wearing the ring, she gains nothing.” The
Siren Virgin smiled.</p>
<p>Han Sen didn’t understand. His body wasn’t deified yet, but his
emotions couldn’t be any less intense than Miss Mirror’s. If the
mirror body reflected emotions and willpower, who knew who might be
getting the better end of the deal?</p>
<p>But knowing the Mirror Spirit Eye Ring did no harm to his body,
Han Sen felt much better. There was no need to worry about the ring
doing anything bad to him.</p>
<p>Plus, he now had a much better understanding of why Miss Mirror
hadn’t turned him in to King Bai. With that clarified, Han Sen felt
much safer.</p>
<p>“That means Miss Mirror won’t want to see me dead, right?” Han
Sen felt happy.</p>
<p>“Of course she won’t want you to die. She might even try to
protect you. After all, if you die, her mirror body will be
damaged, too. And it would take her a very, very long while to
recover from the damage that would be inflicted. It might even be
permanent,” the Siren Virgin said.</p>
<p>“You said King Bai had three methods. What is the third way?”
Han Sen asked.</p>
<p>“As the leader of the Extreme King, King Bai has many ways of
obtaining intel. There is no need to worry about ordinary intel
gatherers. You are a prince, so most will be unable to investigate
you. But King Bai has a network for intel gathering, and it is
called Radio Wave. They have eyes all around the universe. It is a
very powerful web, and that is what should concern you the most. If
your identity is exposed, it will probably be the work of Radio
Wave,” the Siren Virgin said.</p>
<p>“I don’t know who might be a member of Radio Wave, so I cannot
prevent that.” Han Sen shook his head.</p>
<p>“That is okay. I can tell you everything about Bai Yi. Just do
as I say, and no one will be able to prove that you are not Bai
Yi,” the Siren Virgin said.</p>
<p>The Siren Virgin proceeded to tell Han Sen about Bai Yi, and she
ensured that Han Sen remembered all the details she gave him. This
would be a great help for Han Sen in protecting his stolen
identity.</p>
