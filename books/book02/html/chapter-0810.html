    <p>
      Han Sen chased after Wang Yuhang, and as he went, he sensed countless
      scary lifeforces making their way towards the Empty Vine. They had all
      been disturbed and made restless by the human intruders.
    </p>

    <p>
      There was still a while to go before the Empty Fruit ripened. The group of
      people had no idea when exactly it would mature, and going for them now
      would only lead to the creatures stopping them. If they picked the fruit
      before it became ripe, the benefits of its consumption would be far
      weaker, not worth the effort.
    </p>

    <p>
      Even Han Sen, who had received help from super creatures in the past,
      couldn&#8217;t help but feel unnerved and a little scared when he sensed
      the number of creatures in the surrounding area.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;I hope those people don&#8217;t all die. If they do, how am I
      supposed to interrogate them?&#8221; Han Sen thought to himself.
    </p>

    <p>
      Racing across the length of two mountains, Han Sen finally caught up to
      the fleet-footed Wang Yuhang. The owl did not relent in its attacks, and
      all the while, Wang Yuhang stumbled, tripped, and scrambled on his way. He
      had sustained much damage this time. His armor had been pecked at, and
      much of it had been broken. His skin had been pierced, and blood was
      drawn.
    </p>

    <p>
      Although he wasn&#8217;t heavily injured, his face was one of great pity
      and remorse.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen quickly summoned his little angel to prevent the owl from
      continuing its pursuit of Wang Yuhang.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Bossman, you have finally come!&#8221; Wang Yuhang shouted
      excitedly. Not caring for the lesions and wounds that riddled his person,
      he went towards Han Sen.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Wait! Do not come any closer. Continue drawing its attention while
      we finish it.&#8221; Han Sen quickly stopped Wang Yuhang from approaching
      him.
    </p>

    <p>
      Wang Yuhang promptly agreed, and with his bow, fired an arrow towards the
      owl to attract its ire once more. When the owl went after him, the little
      angel was able to quickly get in its way again and block it.
    </p>

    <p>
      When Wang Yuhang noticed the owl&#8217;s inability to reach him, he went a
      little mad. He fired arrows like a loon, maniacally cackling, &#8220;Come
      here, little birdy! I&#8217;m right here! I make for terrific creature
      cuisine, so why do you not attempt to eat me?&#8221; After he had taunted
      it for some time, the owl stopped and made a noise akin to the crying of a
      baby.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Haha! Crying is of little use, little birdy-bird. Come on, come
      over here&#8230; Ouch!&#8221; Wang Yuhang continued his fun in the
      provocation of the owl.
    </p>

    <p>
      But suddenly, a big rat came out of the ground. It was one foot long, and
      when it emerged, it leapt up and bit his ass. Its razor teeth pierced
      right through his armor and sunk deep into his plump bottom. When it
      pulled away, a chunk of Wang Yuhang&#8217;s bum-flesh was torn away.
    </p>

    <p>
      Wang Yuhang held his buttocks and screamed, and as he did so, many other
      black rats emerged from the ground. They ran towards him like the tide of
      the sea.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Oh, no! Does this wretch possess the ability to summon a legion of
      rats to its devilish will? I beseech your aid! Help!&#8221; Wang Yuhang
      summoned a spear and swung it around crazily. But their numbers were
      unfathomable, and after killing a dozen, he could still see countless more
      headed his way.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen used his dongxuan aura to scan the rats. He was surprised to see
      that the rats were not actually creatures, and as a result, possessed no
      lifeforce. They must have been direct summons of the owl, an ability not
      unlike the silver beetle mother.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;I cannot believe this owl can summon its own little mobs. This is
      rather interesting.&#8221; Han Sen summoned his Flaming Rex Spike and
      hurried over to the owl. As he went, he called out, &#8220;Little Uncle,
      hold on! I&#8217;m going to kill this bird.&#8221;
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Then I beg that you make haste. I shan&#8217;t last very much
      longer, if something is not done about these arse-biters soon.
      Ouch!&#8221; Another rat bit Wang Yuhang. This time, it leapt up and
      ripped out a piece of his arm.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;I&#8217;ll be right there.&#8221; Han Sen&#8217;s eyes shone with
      the light of murder.
    </p>

    <p>Pang!</p>

    <p>
      The Flaming Rex Spike was swung upwards, and with the little angel&#8217;s
      cooperation, it was driven harshly against the owl&#8217;s body. The owl
      was knocked a great distance away.
    </p>

    <p>
      The little angel flew forward at once and delivered another slash to the
      owl. Then, Han Sen used his rex spike to hit it again.
    </p>

    <p>
      The first-generation owl didn&#8217;t stand a chance, and it was getting
      destroyed by the duo with no reprieve. Feathers fell and blood rained.
    </p>

    <p>
      The owl, thinking it best to escape, had its departure prevented by Han
      Sen. He grabbed onto it, pulling back the heavily-injured owl.
    </p>

    <p>Pat! Pat! Pat!</p>

    <p>
      Beneath the siege of attacks that were delivered onto it, the owl
      didn&#8217;t have a single chance of fighting back. In minutes, the head
      of the owl was lopped off by a mighty swing of the little angel&#8217;s
      greatsword.
    </p>

    <blockquote>
      <p>
        &#8220;Super Creature Spirit Owl Killed. Beast Soul Gained. The Flesh Of
        This Creature Is Inedible, But You May Harvest Its Life Geno Essence.
        Consume Its Life Geno Essence To Gain Zero To Ten Super Geno Points
        Randomly.&#8221;
      </p>
    </blockquote>

    <p>
      Han Sen was overjoyed to hear this, as it had been a while since he last
      received a beast soul. He curiously pondered what manner of beast soul it
      might be.
    </p>

    <p>
      And with the death of the owl, the carnivorous rats vanished too. Wang
      Yuhang looked at Han Sen with much surprise and said, &#8220;Bossman, your
      strength continues to grow greater and greater. It only took you a few
      minutes to lay utter waste to a super creature!&#8221;
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;I was taking my time.&#8221; Han Sen smiled at Wang Yuhang and
      proceeded to say, &#8220;You should go home; you should leave this place.
      As for myself, there is something else I must attend to.&#8221;
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;I am coming with you. That legion of scum deserves death for what
      they did to me,&#8221; Wang Yuhang said with anger. When his mind went
      back to his mistreatment, and the time he spent caged, he began to tremble
      with rage.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Well, don&#8217;t worry about that. The scum will all be dead
      before long, I assure you,&#8221; Han Sen said.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;What?&#8221; Wang Yuhang asked with surprise. Then, he asked,
      &#8220;Do other super creatures inhabit the treacherous lands of the
      vicinity?&#8221;
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Yes, there are loads. If you hate those people that much, and you
      would like to put your life on the line just so you can watch them get
      brutally torn apart, then let&#8217;s go.&#8221; Han Sen smiled.
    </p>

    <p>
      Wang Yuhang&#8217;s face locked up. He looked as if he was about to say
      something, but just as he was, a black flame erupted from the Empty Vine
      like a volcano.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Um, Bossman? I have a charliehorse; so, I think I&#8217;ll just
      wait for you down there somewhere&#8230; You be careful, okay?&#8221;
      After saying this, Wang Yuhang hastily made his departure from the island.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen decided to take a look at the Spirit Owl beast soul he had
      acquired. It was another pet-type beast soul.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;This is interesting. If I raise this owl, I&#8217;ll almost have an
      army of super creatures at my disposal.&#8221; Han Sen was as delighted as
      he was curious. Still, he knew it would take a while before the pet could
      enter battle-mode.
    </p>

    <p>
      But Han Sen was getting the hang of killing super creatures now, and he
      imagined it wouldn&#8217;t be too much of a struggle.
    </p>

    <p>
      The Death Knell drank blood, whereas the Spirit Owl ate meat. This meant
      he could raise them together, without any conflict between the two
      arising.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen did not have the time to look at the Spirit Owl for long. He
      returned his gaze to the Empty Vine, and when he did, he heard many roars
      accompanying the clanging sounds of various weaponry. The fight seemed to
      be raging.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;I hope the Devil-Blood King is already there. If not, that&#8217;d
      be a pain.&#8221; Han Sen, continuing to look at the Empty Vine as he
      ventured there, was suddenly approached by a few men. It was Manager Qu
      and a few others.
    </p>

    <p>
      They didn&#8217;t seem to be doing all that well. They had already
      injected themselves with the shura liquid, and they seemed to be
      grievously injured.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Han Sen!&#8221; When they saw Han Sen, their faces changed. They
      knew exactly who he was.
