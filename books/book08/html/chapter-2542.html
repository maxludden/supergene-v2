<h2>Elysian Moon Changing</h2>
<h3>Chapter 2542</h3>

<p>The two beautiful women looked like flowers made of jade, and
Han Sen couldn’t turn his back on either of them. He wasn’t their
enemy, so he couldn’t simply choose which one should die.</p>
<p>But when he thought about the arrogant, perfectionist,
blood-thirsty being they combined to become, he knew that he had to
do something. It wasn’t just the other races of the universe that
would fall under their wrath—eventually, they would go after humans
as well.</p>
<p>“What should we do?” Han Sen looked at Gu Qingcheng and then at
Elysian Moon. They looked extremely similar to each other. Their
presences, however, were different.</p>
<p>Gu Qingcheng was mysterious, but she didn’t distance herself
from everyone. Elysian Moon was as cold as ice, and looking at her
gave people the feeling that they were being shut out. Han Sen
could tell the two apart, though, and he would never mistake one
for another.</p>
<p>When they both combined and became one, their presence was
completely different. The woman they made felt like a fairy. She
was a being that didn’t care about anything in the world. That
coldness was chilling to see.</p>
<p>“Which of us do you choose to kill?” Elysian Moon asked when Han
Sen remained silent.</p>
<p>“I’m not killing anyone. To be honest, even if I agreed to kill
you, I don’t think that’s something I could make myself do.” Han
Sen shook his head.</p>
<p>“Then would you prefer to watch us fight each other to death or
die of old age?” Elysian Moon asked emotionlessly.</p>
<p>“That doesn’t matter. I think there might be a road out of this
mess. It is worth a try, at least,” Han Sen said hesitantly.</p>
<p>“What road do you mean?” Elysian Moon and Gu Qingcheng looked up
with interest.</p>
<p>After a moment of thought, Han Sen said, “The aging problem is
being caused by the flaws in your genes. If you can fix these
flaws, then there is no reason for you to fight to your doom.”</p>
<p>Gu Qingcheng shook her head. “If things were that simple, we
wouldn’t have been fighting in the first place. My genes are
included in Elysian Moon’s spirit stone. And Elysian Moon’s genes
contain the sword fairy I created. We both have a part of each
other, and because of that, parts of ourselves are missing. We
can’t use the genes of other creatures to fix problems that are
inherent in our own.”</p>
<p>“I know.” Han Sen nodded, sighed, and said, “My method isn’t for
you to combine with the genes of another creature. My method can
fix your genes as they are.”</p>
<p>“What do you mean? If we could fix our genes, we wouldn’t be
stuck in this situation,” Elysian Moon said, tilting her head to
the side.</p>
<p>“You’re both missing a part of yourselves, and the parts you’re
missing are the parts you gave to each other. That means you aren’t
complete. But, you both still contain the missing components of
each other. All you need to do is fill in the gaps. I can try to
activate both of your gene potentials, which might allow your
incomplete genes to repair themselves. I’m not sure if it will
work, but it is something we should at least try.” The method Han
Sen was proposing would require the power of the Blood-Pulse
Sutra’s area. He would push their self-cogwheels in an attempt to
force their genes to evolve.</p>
<p>The Blood-Pulse Sutra’s area power was little more than a nudge.
Whether or not it worked would be determined by the possibilities
harbored by the genes that required fixing. Therefore, Han Sen
couldn’t promise that he would succeed. It was a chance for them,
though. It was something they had to try before they resorted to
the more sordid solutions.</p>
<p>If it worked, they could both live.</p>
<p>“You can fix the flaws of our genes?” Gu Qingcheng and Elysian
Moon’s beautiful eyes were staring at Han Sen.</p>
<p>“I can’t promise you it will work, but there is no harm in
trying,” Han Sen said.</p>
<p>“Try it, then,” Elysian Moon said immediately.</p>
<p>“We’ll test it on you first. Come over here,” Han Sen said,
looking at Elysian Moon.</p>
<p>“Is there a risk to this process?” Gu Qingcheng asked.</p>
<p>“There is no risk. While there is a chance that it won’t
succeed, failure shouldn’t result in any harm to your bodies,” Han
Sen said.</p>
<p>Elysian Moon walked over to Han Sen. Her voice was completely
level as she said, “A long time ago, you were rather unfond of me,
weren’t you? It is good that I’m in danger, is it not? If I am
dead, then you can be free.”</p>
<p>Elysian Moon was saying this to Gu Qingcheng, not Han Sen.</p>
<p>Gu Qingcheng moved her lips, but no words were spoken.</p>
<p>“Don’t worry, only good things can happen to you. Otherwise, I
wouldn’t want to try this.” Han Sen understood what the two women
wanted. He smiled at Elysian Moon.</p>
<p>“Stop talking crap. Let’s get on with it. Even when I was a
spirit, I was never afraid of death,” Elysian Moon said, meeting
Han Sen’s eyes.</p>
<p>Han Sen smiled, lifted his right hand, and pressed his fingers
to Elysian Moon’s forehead. Then, he started to cast the
Blood-Pulse Sutra. He made his self-cogwheel connect with Elysian
Moon’s self-cogwheel. Then, he started to spin them.</p>
<p>“Don’t try to resist my power. Try to accept it and move with
it.” A blood godlight formed on Han Sen’s hands, and the light
seeped into and melded with Elysian Moon’s body.</p>
<p>When the blood light entered her, Elysian Moon’s self-gene power
was activated. The dusty self-cogwheel started to spin a
little.</p>
<p>Elysian Moon’s self-cogwheel was blue. It had old-fashioned
symbols inscribed upon it. Han Sen didn’t know what they meant, but
he knew that it was the source of Elysian Moon’s power.</p>
<p>When Elysian Moon’s self-cogwheel began to accelerate, the
old-fashioned symbols shone brightly. They were like a sun. The
light blurred as the self-cogwheels spun.</p>
<p>Blue lights rose from the cogwheel, dyeing Elysian Moon’s flesh
and cells a weird shade of blue. The woman looked like a blue
crystal statue.</p>
<p>The color was rather ghostly, and Elysian Moon no longer looked
like a person. She was like some sort of phantom, or the crystal
statue of a witch. And before long, the crystal started to
melt.</p>
<p>No, rather than melting, it was like dirt was being washed off
of the crystal statue, layer by layer. It was like a flower
shedding its wilted petals.</p>
<p>Gu Qingcheng watched Elysian Moon and Han Sen. Her face was
always impassive, but right now, she looked nervous.</p>
<p>The crystalline Elysian Moon’s blue light began to fade. The
blue light dissolved into dust, and Elysian Moon’s body changed as
the light peeled away. She was starting to become someone different
from who she was before.</p>
<p>Han Sen was so happy. Elysian Moon’s genes were starting to
change. That meant his Blood-Pulse Sutra was working. Even if he
was unable to fix them entirely, this process was still going to
benefit Elysian Moon’s body.</p>
<p>But Elysian Moon wasn’t like Lando, who was a top half-deified.
Rather than leveling her up, Han Sen’s power simply improved her
genes. Her talent and powers were increasing.</p>
<p>Buzz!</p>
<p>A strange sound came from Elysian Moon’s body, like a sword was
being unsheathed. A scary swordmind blossomed from her, and the
ghostly air shifted around her. The weird blue light faded
further.</p>
<p>Describing Elysian Moon was difficult, because she now looked
like a ghost woman from hell. Right now, Elysian Moon looked like a
cold fairy in the moonlight. She seemed distant, but not in a way
that would frighten people.</p>
