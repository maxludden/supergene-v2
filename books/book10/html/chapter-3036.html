<h2>Seeing God Temples Again</h2>
<h3>Chapter 3036</h3>

<p>Ancient Big God Mountain was an old mountain. Although the name
sounded like Ancient God City, it was not in Ancient Big God
Mountain. It was somewhere quiet near the mountain.</p>
<p>Han Sen dressed in black clothing and followed Mister Yang to
Ancient God City. He curiously looked at everything in Ancient God
City.</p>
<p>Everything in Ancient God City was new to Han Sen. It was a very
modern city. Actually, instead of being a city, it was more like an
old fortress that had been modernized.</p>
<p>The city had cars and aircraft, and there were many of them.</p>
<p>There was something Han Sen did not understand. For such a
developed city, it was still in an empirical era. Ancient God City
belonged to the Qin Kingdom.</p>
<p>The lowest form of measurement in the Qin Kingdom was a city.
There were no separations between states. Every city belonged to
the big Qin Kingdom, and every planet only had one city. The weird
thing was that aside from this advanced technology, every human had
all kinds of pets exist near them.</p>
<p>According to what Mister Yang said, these pets were called gene
races. They were creatures that came out from gene eggs. Han Sen
had also come out from a gene egg. He was at a high level for just
being born.</p>
<p>Han Sen looked around. He saw some tigers, lions, elephants, and
creatures like that. He saw those gene races. One person even had a
big green mantis.</p>
<p>Han Sen was not able to use his Dongxuan Aura to scan the gene
races and learn a bit more about what they were. He could not tell
much about their appearances.</p>
<p>“Mister, ahead is the god temple of Ancient God City.” Mister
Yang pointed forward and smiled as he spoke.</p>
<p>Han Sen looked at where Mister Yang was pointing to. He squinted
his eyes and noted that the god temple was in the center of Ancient
God City. It was built from purple stone and looked very old. The
shape of the temple was weird. The temples connected. From afar, it
looked like a giant purple flower. On top of the temple’s door was
a carving that said, “Evil Lotus God Temple.”</p>
<p>That name and look of the city was something Han Sen was very
familiar with. It made him think, “Aside from the god flag, this
place is Evil Lotus God’s god temple.”</p>
<p>Han Sen wanted to walk inside and take a look. He wanted to see
if any statues depicted Evil Lotus God, but Mister Yang pulled him
away with a nervous look. He said, “Mister, you cannot do this. The
god temples are the base of a city. They are very important for a
city. The city leader puts heavy guards there. Ordinary people
cannot enter. It is only open to the public on Blood Pulse Open
Day. Only people of suitable age can enter and seek a blessing
inside the god temple to open their god blood.”</p>
<p>“I see. When is Blood Pulse Open Day?” Han Sen was not in a rush
to breakthrough.</p>
<p>Han Sen still had his power, but the universe suppressed him. He
did not have his full power to fight. According to what Mister Yang
told him, this world, which was called a geno universe too, had
seven universe kingdoms.</p>
<p>The Big Qin Kingdom was one such place, and Big Qin Kingdom’s
creator was called Qin Xiu. That had happened many years ago. Now,
Big Qin Kingdom’s king was the ancestor of Qin Xiu.</p>
<p>If that Qin Xiu was the Qin Xiu Han Sen used to know, in that
era of Qin Xiu, he had not ruled the world either. That meant the
other six universe kingdoms were not any weaker than the Qin
Kingdom. They were probably no worse than Qin Xiu.</p>
<p>Han Sen was a guest, but he was suppressed by this world. In
this world, the geno hall probably existed. Perhaps the geno hall
had picked on Qin Xiu. Since Han Sen was an outsider, it might end
up picking on him as well.</p>
<p>Han Sen planned to figure out what was going on in that geno
universe. He would then decide what to do next. He did not want to
maintain a high profile.</p>
<p>The legend of Qin Xiu and Qin Wan’er was something Han Sen heard
about from Mister Yang. He knew for sure Qin Xiu was the creator of
the Big Qin Kingdom.</p>
<p>“If this is the antimaterial world, what does it have to do with
the other geno universe? Why did the black crystal want me to be
brought here? Why does this place also have god temples?” Han Sen
just wanted to go to Evil Lotus God Temple and mosey around. He
wanted to check out the Evil Lotus God Mister Yang had described to
him and see if it was the Evil Lotus God he used to know.</p>
<p>“Mister, Ancient God City opens every three months, which are
counted by the days. Blood Pulse Open Day is in two days. At that
time, you can go and have a look with other people.” Mister Yang
spoke with a small amount of hesitation. Still, he looked very
determined. He went on to lick Han Sen’s boots and say, “My house
is in Ancient God City. If you are not against the prospect, why
don’t you come over and stay at my house for two days? We can come
back the day after tomorrow.”</p>
<p>“Why not?” Han Sen nodded.</p>
<p>Han Sen was not an unreasonable man. He was neither a robber nor
a thief. If it was not necessary, he did not want to use force.
Waiting two days was not a big deal. He did not need to force his
way into the god temple.</p>
<p>They reached Mister Yang’s house. Mister Yang asked Han Sen to
sit down in the living room. He brought out tea and said, “Wait for
a second, Mister. I am going to the yard to clear a place out for
you to live.”</p>
<p>Han Sen looked at Mister Yang coldly as he said, “Mister Yang,
you know what you are supposed to say and what you are not supposed
to say.”</p>
<p>Mister Yang felt a chill and seriously replied, “Do not worry,
Mister. I understand. You are just a Mister, a man from out of
town.”</p>
<p>After Mister Yang left, Han Sen sat in the living room and drank
tea. In this world, Han Sen felt that his body was suppressed.
Everything else seemed fairly similar to the geno universe he used
to know. Even the tea tasted similar.</p>
<p>Han Sen was leaning against the door of the living room. He was
drinking tea and looking at the drawings on the wall.</p>
<p>Geno races were depicted in the drawings. Han Sen was surprised
by the fact that one of the gene races in the drawings looked quite
familiar. It looked like Empty Dragon King.</p>
<p>Han Sen was looking at the drawing when a female’s voice
suddenly sounded from beyond the door. “Are you Mister Yang?”</p>
<p>Han Sen looked over to where the voice came from. A woman
standing just outside the door. She was clad in green clothing. She
looked very pretty. She looked like someone in a drawing. She
seemed to be around 20.</p>
<p>“Why are you looking for Mister Yang?” Han Sen casually asked.
He also wondered if this was Mister Yang’s house because of the
green-clothed woman’s ability to enter and why she did not seem to
recognize him.</p>
<p>“I did not expect Mister Yang to be so young. My name is
Peaceful. Mister Qiu advised me to come here. I want him to take me
to Ancient Big God Mountain and help me calculate the location of
the god pulse.” The woman explained why she was there. She did not
beat around the bush.</p>
<p>Han Sen had heard about this from Mister Yang. The Mister was
just a job title. It was not his name. Mister Yang must have been
hired by Mister Meng to find the location of the god pulse.</p>
<p>All the gene eggs were born inside the god pulses. God pulses
were hard to find. God pulse gene eggs were hard to find, and
Misters were the professionals that researched them.</p>
