    <p>
      Han Sen couldn&#8217;t think of a solution to the predicament he was in,
      so he thought about sending his mother a message. He had hoped to maybe
      receive some help from his mother, and perhaps get a glimpse of the true
      extent of her power.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Figure it out yourself.&#8221; The text reply was those four simple
      words.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen shook his head and gave a wry smile. His hopes were quickly
      dashed, so he gave up on the idea of consulting his mother on this. Now,
      he knew he had to sort it out himself.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;I doubt I can outrun it. It really seems the only way out of this
      is to kill the thing. But the fairy&#8217;s body is so strong that not
      even my Elephant-Rex Strike was able to damage it. How on earth can I kill
      something that strong?&#8221; Han Sen thought to himself.
    </p>

    <p>
      While Han Sen was still in the midst of these thoughts, his communicator
      rang. There was a message.
    </p>

    <p>
      The message came from a number that was unknown to him. Alongside the text
      there was a video, and it was showcasing a hyper geno art.
    </p>

    <p>
      But this hyper geno art did not have any instructions, and its ending was
      cut-off. Even its title wasn&#8217;t there. That being said, the
      explanation was very detailed.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Wrong number, maybe?&#8221; Han Sen took a peek and was quickly
      attracted by its contents. Giving it a proper read, he was shocked at what
      it contained.
    </p>

    <p>
      If this hyper geno art was genuine, it supposed that you could unleash
      your elemental powers before achieving the rank of a celestial being. Such
      a power would unleash massive damage.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;A hyper geno art of this magnitude was sent to the wrong number?
      That&#8217;s a little hard to believe. There has to be more to this than
      meets the eye.&#8221; Han Sen thought, so he decided to reply to the
      message. &#8220;Hello. How are you? I think you sent this to the wrong
      person.&#8221;
    </p>

    <p>
      If the person really did send it to an incorrect address, it would be easy
      for them to learn who the recipient was. It would be impossible for Han
      Sen to hide or deny the fact he had received the message, so there was no
      point in lying.
    </p>

    <p>&#8220;No. I was correct,&#8221; the person quickly replied.</p>

    <p>
      Han Sen was surprised. He frowned and sent another message. &#8220;You
      know who I am?&#8221;
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Han Sen.&#8221; The person on the other end sent those two measly
      words.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Who are you? Why are you providing me with this hyper geno
      art?&#8221; Han Sen was intrigued, and so he responded with haste.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;You deserve it. If there is anything you do not understand during
      its training, feel free to message me.&#8221; It wasn&#8217;t the answer
      Han Sen wanted, but at least the person on the other end was now typing
      complete, lengthy sentences.
    </p>

    <p>Han Sen sent another message, but he received no response.</p>

    <p>
      &#8220;What does a &#8216;bright day&#8217; mean?&#8221; Han Sen read the
      hyper geno art, selected the two words and messaged the person on the
      other end.
    </p>

    <p>
      To this, the person on the other end instantly replied and explained its
      meaning.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Who are you?&#8221; Han Sen asked again, but like before, this
      question went unanswered. It was fairly obvious by now that this person
      was only willing to talk about the hyper geno art. Anything else was met
      with silence.
    </p>

    <p>
      But Han Sen himself now went quiet. The hyper geno art appeared strange,
      and it was delivered by a person who seemed quite fishy. Anyone would have
      exercised caution if they were in Han Sen&#8217;s boots right then.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen looked over the hyper geno art quite a few times and came to
      understand that it was indeed quite a powerful skill. The details were
      very well-explained, so it didn&#8217;t seem possible for it to be a
      knock-off. Han Sen believed it to be the real deal.
    </p>

    <p>
      If he successfully learnt this hyper geno art, it might be what was needed
      for the little angel to wipe out the little fairy. The only problem was
      the way in which it had been delivered. It came into his possession quite
      strangely, and Han Sen wasn&#8217;t sure why anyone would be willing to
      send him such a special hyper geno art willy-nilly. Han Sen wondered what
      the person sought to achieve, by giving it to him.
    </p>

    <p>
      At this time, on another planet, a middle-aged man had a cruel expression
      on his face. He sat inside a pavilion, drinking tea. All the while, he
      watched fish swim about in a pond.
    </p>

    <p>
      In the center of the pavilion was a stone table, and sitting near it was a
      beautiful woman. She was engaged with a laptop. She put it down and said
      with a smile, &#8220;Do you think that guy will go ahead and learn
      it?&#8221;
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;He has to.&#8221; The man did not move his head or avert his gaze
      from the fish.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;What if he doesn&#8217;t?&#8221; The beautiful woman asked, with
      some excitement over the entire affair.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;He will. He may not be Luo in name, but he still shares our blood.
      He is carrying our genes and so, he will learn it,&#8221; the man
      explained, without lifting his head. His voice was calm and composed, and
      it oozed confidence.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;But his body&#8217;s blood isn&#8217;t solely from the Luo
      family.&#8221; The beautiful woman squinted her eyes and continued by
      saying, &#8220;Lady Lan has been gone for many years. She tried everything
      she could to get away from us. Why bother them now?&#8221;
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;This is the fate of the Luo family; it is not something we can
      escape.&#8221; The man&#8217;s eyes looked strange.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;If, I was just saying &#8216;if,&#8217; he did not learn it.&#8221;
      The woman increased her tone of voice deliberately.
    </p>

    <p>
      The man now slowly turned around. He stared at the woman for a while and
      then said, &#8220;He will learn it. No ifs, no buts. If he does not learn
      it, then that means he is not one of ours.&#8221;
    </p>

    <p>
      The beautiful woman was silenced and she did not say anything else. She
      maintained the silence between them in the pavilion, and simply listened
      to the gentle wind that caressed them both.
    </p>

    <p>
      On Planet Roca, Luo Sulan placed her hands on her cheeks and daydreamed in
      front of her desk. She sighed and thought, &#8220;I can only suppose they
      are aware of Han Sen&#8217;s existence by now. The Falsified-Sky Sutra is
      in Han Sen&#8217;s hands by now, most probably. Can he resist the
      temptation of its learning? It is difficult to say.&#8221;
    </p>

    <p>
      Inside the base headquarters, Han Sen turned his communicator off and
      stopped reading the hyper geno art.
    </p>

    <p>
      The Falsified-Sky Sutra was not enough to draw Han Sen in yet, as Dongxuan
      Sutra was not inferior to it. The skill was presented to him out of
      nowhere, and he was still not sure who had given it to him and for what
      purpose. He wasn&#8217;t quite willing to accept a skill he had no prior
      knowledge about.
    </p>

    <p>
      And he still had Blood-Pulse to learn in the near future, too. That
      wasn&#8217;t any worse than the Falsified-Sky Sutra, either.
    </p>

    <p>
      This was one aspect of his personality that Luo Sulan made sure to train
      into Han Sen as he grew up. There were some self-serving modifications,
      however.
    </p>

    <p>
      Luo Sulan formulated a base for Han Sen&#8217;s personality, and it was
      only after he had been living in the shelter that it started to complete.
      It even had his own style.
    </p>

    <p>
      Even Luo Sulan thought Han Sen could not resist the temptation of learning
      the skill. But what neither she nor the mysterious figures knew, was that
      Han Sen had the Dongxuan Sutra. He was far more powerful than they both
      believed him to be, and as such, the Falsified-Sky Sutra meant little to
      him.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen logged into the Skynet and entered the Saint Hall community. He
      purchased the skill &#8220;Sonic-Thunder Punch.&#8221; He had finally come
      up with a way to kill the fairy.
