<h2>Name List</h2>
<h3>Chapter 2825</h3>

<p>Han Sen thought, Has this scroll recorded the elites that killed
gods before? He thought something was amiss with what was going
on.</p>
<p>Sacred Leader researched for a long time and was unable to kill
the gods. Why would a subordinate of his, Purple Fight, kill a god
with success? That is so weird. Plus, that woman and Horizontal
Evil used to say that without a super gene, you could not kill a
god. Even Sacred Leader was unable to find a super gene. How did
Purple Fight find a super gene? Han Sen’s brain was flooded with
intense wonder.</p>
<p>To find an answer in the scroll, Han Sen added power into his
hands to pull the scroll open even more.</p>
<p>The scroll was hard to open. It was like it was glued shut. It
took a lot of power to get it open. The more he pulled it, the
harder it became. With Han Sen’s larva class power, even he almost
couldn’t hold it open.</p>
<p>There are more words… Horizontal Evil… Killing the gods… When
Han Sen saw the name, he froze.</p>
<p>Horizontal Evil was the Breakskies alpha. Han Sen had pinned him
on a mountainside a while ago. He was never granted death, so he
was stuck in a state of not living and not dying. Horizontal Evil
even told Han Sen that he did not have the power to eliminate a
god. If that was true, why did the scroll possess words that
suggested the contrary?</p>
<p>Han Sen suddenly thought the scroll was Holy Kirin’s prank.
Otherwise, having such a list of names was pointless. Was he giving
Purple Fight, Horizontal Evil, and the others a crime?</p>
<p>Although Han Sen doubted the credibility of the scroll, he
continued pulling the scroll open. He wanted to see what was at the
end.</p>
<p>Eventually, when he pulled it to some level, the drawing’s power
was too strong. He was not able to keep pulling the scroll open
anymore.</p>
<p>“Open!” Han Sen groaned. Sky Star Wolf’s glyph flashed on his
body, giving him a bit more power. He kept pulling the scroll
open.</p>
<p>Han Sen’s arms had veins sticking out. Many substance chains
flashed across his hands. He was forcing the scroll open bit by
bit.</p>
<p>“Han Yufei… Blasphemy to god… got hit into a loophole never to
be reborn…” Han Sen finally saw a crime with a different title.
That made him wonder even more.</p>
<p>Han Sen’s head was full of questions. Han Yufei? That should be
a woman’s name. But who is she? What does it have to do with
Sacred? How does she have the crime of being blasphemous to a god?
That cannot be as bad as killing a god. But why are Purple Fight’s
crime and the others involve just killing, and this woman was hit
into a loophole to never be reborn?</p>
<p>Pang!</p>
<p>Han Sen’s power was no longer able to hold against the strength
of the scroll. The scroll’s two sticks bounced back into their
original position, rerolling the paper to how it was. The scroll
then tried to fly away.</p>
<p>Han Sen held onto the scroll and suppressed it enough to stick
it in Destiny’s Tower.</p>
<p>What is going on here? Why have so many people managed to kill a
god before? Han Sen was very suspicious, but he did not have enough
information. He could not make a reasonable judgment just yet.</p>
<p>It looks like I will have to wait until my power is stronger. At
that time, I can completely open the scroll and learn the meaning
of the names in the scroll. Han Sen put the issue of the scroll
aside.</p>
<p>He was now an adult. Although no one would have been able to
tell he was Han Sen, it was not suitable for him to remain with the
Extreme King anymore. So, Han Sen teleported back to the
sanctuaries.</p>
<p>Han Ling’er was learning how to draw in the garden when she saw
Han Sen suddenly appear. She tilted her head to the side, looked at
him, and asked, “Are you a thief?”</p>
<p>“If I was a thief, what would you do to me?” Han Sen smiled and
looked at Han Ling’er. He wanted to prank her.</p>
<p>Han Ling’er blinked and said, “Mister Handsome Thief, you look
very hot. If you leave now, I will pretend she never saw you.”</p>
<p>Han Sen’s head was full of dark clouds. Ling’er is so small, and
she is already obsessed with appearances. I should teach her that
good-looking men are not trustable."</p>
<p>“Ling’er, do you not recognize Dad?” Han Sen asked. He looked
gloomy.</p>
<p>“Dad?” Han Ling’er looked at Han Sen with confusion. A while
later, she tilted her head and was gladly thrust into Han Sen’s
hands. She asked, “Dad? Since when did you become so handsome?”</p>
<p>Han Sen wished to say something more, but he heard Ji Yanran
approaching. She looked at Han Sen for a while. With surprise, she
said, “Han Sen, why do you look better now?”</p>
<p>Han Sen explained what had happened to him. Ji Yanran and
Ling’er were next to Han Sen. He had one in each arm. They were
next to him listening to him explain what had happened.</p>
<p>Han Sen quickly noticed that his reputation in the house had
been greatly increased. Before, when he arrived home, he would just
eat normal food. Now, Ji Yanran made some extra good dishes.</p>
<p>Ling’er kept going around Han Sen for hugs. She didn’t stop. She
kept calling out for daddy and asking for kisses.</p>
<p>This mother and daughter… Han Sen noticed that to increase his
reputation in their family, power and such were useless. Good looks
were the most effective weapons.</p>
<p>“My original face was not that bad.” Han Sen felt sad. His face
had not been a super handsome one, but his body shape and presence
was always there. He could not have been any worse than a
supermodel. His treatment, however, was terrible.</p>
<p>The next morning, after resting for a day, Han Sen was woken up
by Ji Yanran screaming.</p>
<p>“What is it? It is very early in the morning.” Han Sen sat up
and discovered that something was wrong. He looked closer. His body
had turned into the body of a child again. Even Han Sen was
shocked.</p>
<p>“What happened? Why do I look like this again? I thought after
reaching larva class that I would be normal.” Han Sen developed a
cold sweat.</p>
<p>“So adorable…” Ji Yanran hugged Han Sen in her arms. She used
her cheeks to rub against Han Sen’s cheeks and said, “Littleflower
was this cute when he was this small.”</p>
<p>Han Sen did not know what to say. Ji Yanran was very accepting
of the fact that her husband had turned into a child. She was not
worried.</p>
<p>Han Sen researched this for a while. He found out he could not
stay an adult for a long amount of time. Every once in awhile, he
was able to turn into an adult, but he would not be an adult for a
long time. He was only able to be an adult for around 10 hours.
After that, he turned back into a child.</p>
<p>I went through all this trouble, and I am still not recovered!
It looks like I will have to become butterfly class to totally
recover. Han Sen was thinking about how to escape the Extreme King,
but it turned out that there was no need for now. He decided to
remain Holy Baby in the Extreme King and take advantage of their
resources.</p>
<p>While he was still an adult, Han Sen harnessed his power to use
the Four Sheep Cube and enter God’s Farm. He wanted to see if he
could find Wan’er again.</p>
<p>Han Sen had just entered God’s Farm when he saw Wan’er killing
sheep with her knife. This delighted him.</p>
<p>I researched how to deal with God’s Knife for a long time. Now,
I can put my exercise into practice. Han Sen teleported in front of
Wan’er. He looked at Wan’er, who was holding God’s Knife and
slurping up blood, and said, “Wan’er, back off!”</p>
