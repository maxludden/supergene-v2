<p>As the ground collapsed and Han Sen found himself in free fall, he let go of the coin</p>

<p>to plummet by itself. Then, he flew back up to the ground that was still stable.</p>

<p>He waited near the drop for a long time, but the coin did not seem to find ground. If it</p>

<p>had, it would have exploded with a blast Han Sen was sure to feel. Han Sen poked</p>

<p>his head over the sides of the hole that had formed, and it was only then that a scary</p>

<p>power burst out of the ground like a geyser.</p>

<p>The power sent Han Sen flying, around fifty meters away from the hole.</p>

<p>Both sides of the hole had been brought to ruin. The power unleashed by a Saving</p>

<p>Money coin, dialed to the number one hundred, was far too terrifying for Han Sen to</p>

<p>comprehend.</p>

<p>Once he got back on his feet and patted himself down, Han Sen inched his way back</p>

<p>to the drop to get a clearer look at the aftermath. But before he could do that, he</p>

<p>could feel his super king spirit release a substance inside him.</p>

<p>“Aha! Did it work? Am I finally generating a new geno core?” Han Sen stopped to</p>

<p>take a look with sudden happiness.</p>

<p>It was, and just like the formation of his other geno cores, a substance was released</p>

<p>into his Sea of Soul.</p>

<p>It gathered together in a spot and began to swirl, before hardening to present</p>

<p>something solid and tangible. The black crystal, as it always did, released some</p>

<p>liquid that joined the swirling fluids and partook in the creation process.</p>

<p>The black crystal wasn’t very big by this point. After having created the other geno</p>

<p>cores, its size had been reduced by fifty percent. And now, with the release of more</p>

<p>liquid, it was getting even smaller.</p>

<p>But this time, Han Sen’s shock and awe was taken to a whole new level.</p>

<p>The black crystal was no longer a black crystal. It didn’t seem crytallized anymore.</p>

<p>Its color had been wholly robbed, and its shape had been warped. It became a faint,</p>

<p>translucent item that seemed to possess a blurry halo in its interior.</p>

<p>Without the black coloration of the crystal, the light inside was free to shine out. It</p>

<p>began to beam brighter than the sun.</p>

<p>It was so bright, Han Sen was unable to see what might have truly resided within that</p>

<p>light, but whatever it was, he could feel the power it possessed.</p>

<p>Before Han Sen could investigate it any further, though, the geno creation process</p>

<p>was complete. His super king spirit geno core had taken the form of a coin.</p>

<p>The coin had the number one fixed on its front, and on the back was an image of</p>

<p>Han Sen in his super king spirit form.</p>

<p>Self Geno Core: Bronze Dollar</p>

<p>Han Sen did not have time to check out the geno core in great detail, though. The</p>

<p>volume of the halo’s brightness went up a few more notches, completely blinding</p>

<p>Han Sen.</p>

<p>Fortunately, the light was not harmful. And after a short period of believing himself to</p>

<p>be blind, his vision began to return.</p>

<p>Han Sen took another look at where the black crystal had been, and what he saw</p>

<p>gave him another surprise.</p>

<p>The black crystal was completely gone; it had been replaced by a black crystal armor</p>

<p>set. It was a heavy armor, but it had been forged with a sleekness in mind. It would</p>

<p>be tight-fitting and rather feminine, in many respects.</p>

<p>There was also a weapon alongside the armor set. Placed firmly in the gauntlets,</p>

<p>there was a black crystal greatsword. And on the back of the armor were black</p>

<p>crystal wings.</p>

<p>The black crystal armor was motionless; it was just there. He couldn’t see if there</p>

<p>was a creature in it or not, but Han Sen could tell the energy it contained exceeded</p>

<p>that of Night Empress.</p>

<p>After trying to give it a scan, however, Han Sen noticed its energy reduce.</p>

<p>After a bit more time elapsed, all its power had depleted.</p>

<p>In Shadow Shelter, the Nine-Life Cat suddenly opened both of its eyes with a look of</p>

<p>confusion. It arose from its slumber and took off running towards the valley Han Sen</p>

<p>was in.</p>

<p>Nine-Life Cat saw Han Sen there, and with a brisk teleportation, it appeared where</p>

<p>the ground had caved in. It called over to Han Sen, saying, “Weird. I just felt it.</p>

<p>Where is it? Has it gone?”</p>

<p>Nine-Life Cat sniffed around the ruined pasture in search of something, but could</p>

<p>find nothing.</p>

<p>“Why are you here, kitty?” Han Sen opened his eyes near the drop and saw the cat.</p>

<p>Nine-Life Cat did not respond to his question and merely went on to ask, “Did you</p>

<p>see something?”</p>

<p>“What? What did I see?” Han Sen asked, obviously confused.</p>

<p>Nine-Life Cat ignored Han Sen and began talking to itself, pondering something</p>

<p>intently. “Am I mistaken? This thing shouldn’t be here.”</p>

<p>“What thing? What are you mistaken about? Hello? Are you going to talk to me?”</p>

<p>Han Sen walked up to the Nine-Life Cat while asking.</p>

<p>Nine-Life Cat shook his tail, saying, “It’s none of your business! You still only have a</p>

<p>bronze geno core. When are you going to become a god? You should really think</p>

<p>about hurrying up.”</p>

<p>“Does it matter to you whether or not I become a god? What interest do you have in</p>

<p>my affairs?” Han Sen said.</p>

<p>Nine-Life Cat looked at Han Sen with a fairly serious look. He told him, “If you don’t</p>

<p>become a god, how am I supposed to get back…?”</p>

<p>Nine-Life Cat then realized he had just said something he shouldn’t have.</p>

<p>This prompted Han Sen to ask, “Back? Back where?”</p>

<p>“It’s nothing.” Then, Nine-Life Cat started walking away, as if nothing had happened.</p>

<p>“Are you from the Fifth Sanctuary? Am I supposed to be your transport there?” Han</p>

<p>Sen asked after it.</p>

<p>Nine-Life Cat did not turn around. It continued to walk away, and as it went, it</p>

<p>answered, “Getting to the Fifth Sanctuary isn’t easy.”</p>

<p>Han Sen wished to ask more questions, but all of a sudden, Nine-Life Cat</p>

<p>disappeared.</p>

<p>Han Sen shook his head and disregarded the cat. Then, he returned his attention to</p>

<p>the Sea of Soul. The armor set was still there, but it was dead and devoid of a</p>

<p>lifeforce.</p>

<p>He could not bring it out of the Sea of Soul for some strange reason, and all he could</p>

<p>do was view it with mild curiosity. The armor set, for what it was worth, gave him the</p>

<p>same feelings he received whenever he inspected the black crystal, though.</p>

<p>Han Sen wanted to go back now, but before he took off, he saw something flicker in</p>

<p>the hole. It seemed as if something was down there.</p>

<p>It was dark down in that pit, though. And the light appeared to be very deep within</p>

<p>the hole, which made it hard for him to see what it might be.</p>
