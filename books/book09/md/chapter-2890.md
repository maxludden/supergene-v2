There were only 10,000 higher races. Only 20 out of those higher races could have true god elites.

Now, many higher-race true gods were appearing. Whoever was behind this must have been a very scary foe.

One thing Han Sen was happy about was the fact he hadn’t seen any from the top three higher races. If the person behind all this could control the three higher races, it would be pretty scary.

“Han Sen, are you going to turn back now?” Destroyed Leader’s three heads scolded Han Sen at the same time. The Big Destroyed Blurry God Light became stronger. It shocked the whole galaxy.

All of the Buddha were excited. Pure Sea King shouted, “Please help our people and kill this thief!”

“This person is so rude to everyone. We should kill him.”

“Yes, we should kill him.”

The true gods were telling Han Sen to go back. The sky looked like it was filled with demon gods that were surrounding Han Sen. They did not want to let him leave. Obviously, they would not let him leave with ease. They scolded Han Sen to try and get him to give up fighting the Buddha.

“Today, I, Han Sen, am lighting up a lantern for the crystallizers. Whoever gets in my way will die.” Han Sen raised his eyebrows. He did not care about all the true god elites showing up, or their scary force of suppression. The knife light outside his body was spinning. It was like a galaxy going toward the race lantern.

All the races in the universe were shocked. They did not expect Han Sen would still want to destroy the Buddha’s race lantern in the presence of all those true gods.

On a planet that belonged to the Thousand Treasury, Stay Up Late’s eyes were bright. He clenched his fists so tight that his nails dug into his flesh. The blood dribbled out of his fists. It did not seem as if he could feel anything.

“Can the crystallizers really become a higher race?” Stay Up Late had been in the universe for a long time. He knew a lot about the universe. He knew how hard Han Sen’s upcoming fight was going to be. He stilled hoped it was possible for him to succeed.

When the crystallizers lost, a small number of people retreated into the sanctuaries. No one thought they would return to the universe. They did not even think about being a higher race again.

The crystallizers were now just one step away from being a higher race, but this next step seemed mammoth in size. The true gods were everywhere like mountains one could not cross.

“Why? Why us? Why must the crystallizers endure so much to become a higher race? Why do all these true gods want to make it so difficult for us?” In the universe, all the leftover crystallizer children wept. Their eyes were red like Stay Up Late’s. They were so angry that they roared.

A dozen true god elite bodies wielded a God Light. Destroyed Leader, who blocked Han Sen, was exploding a Big Destroyed Blurry God Light ahead. The light was going toward Han Sen. It seemed like it was breaking the sky.

Han Sen did not want to retreat. The shield in his hands unleashed a weird light. Medusa’s eyes were slightly open. The weird light froze the Big Destroyed Blurry God Light in the air. At the same time, Han Sen cast a God Light.

This God Light was not the knife light Han Sen had been using. This was an amazing light. The moment the light landed on Destroyed Leader, his body exploded with Blurry God Light. He was going to fight against that God Light.

The God Light was not affected by the Blurry God Light. After it landed on Destroyed Leader, he underwent magnificent changes. The changes made Destroyed Leader’s face change. The true god elites surrounding Han Sen were shocked. They all stopped trying to kill and looked like they were in shock. They fell back uncontrollably.

God Light had shone down on Destroyed Leader, who was true god class. His body devolved quickly. Instead of true god, he turned into a butterfly class.

The flood of knife lights suddenly traveled by and ravaged Destroyed Leader’s body. Destroyed Leader was now butterfly class. He could not hope to block an attack by Han Sen now that he was at the same level as him. His body was ripped apart. He was reduced to dust.

Northern Light Alpha and the others were all shocked. They were terrified, so they all fell back. Destroyed Leader was powerful, but Han Sen had reduced him from true god to butterfly class right before annihilating him. Destroyed Leader did not even have a chance to fall back.

If Han Sen had not just killed Destroyed Leader in front of them, they would not have believed it. But they had watched Destroyed Leader go from true god to butterfly class by Han Sen. That scariness was more shocking than Han Sen killing Destroyed Leader.

“What was that?”

“Destroyed Leader was deified. He was true god class, but he became butterfly class because of Han Sen.”

“What was that power? He turned a true god into a butterfly.”

“God’s Daddy really is God’s Daddy. He can let you level up, and he can let you level down. This is so fucking sick.”

“That is way too much power. Who can fight against such power? Even a true god elite was downgraded. If Han Sen joined the geno god list fight, he would have likely ended up in first place. It wouldn’t be Golden Growler giving his position to Dollar.”

“Your Daddy is still your Daddy.”

“God’s Daddy really is God’s Daddy. So what if you are a true god. Ha! Ha! You are still a son…”

Han Sen killed Destroyed Leader. He coldly looked at Northern Alpha and the other true gods. It made them feel a chill and want to fall back. They had all seen what had happened. They were scary elites who had been through a lot. Even if they met an enemy that was much stronger than them, they would not have felt this way. But Destroyed Leader had been turned into a butterfly class fighter. That was too shocking. This was beyond what they knew how to deal with. That was why they felt so scared.

It was extremely difficult to become true god. They understood how difficult it was. They had suddenly discovered that Han Sen could destroy all of that progress in a few seconds. How could they still remain calm?

Han Sen proudly stood in space. He stared out at the universe and coldly asked, “Who is going to stop me from lighting up a lantern for the crystallizers?”

Northern Light Alpha and the others did not say a word. No one dared block Han Sen now. While Han Sen was walking toward the Buddha, the true gods in front of him slowly moved away in retreat.

The whole universe was quiet. No one dared to answer.

The expressions on the faces of Burning Lamp and the Buddha looked terrible. They could not believe that even with the aid of so many true god elites, Han Sen was not stopped from destroying the Buddha’s lantern.

Seeing Han Sen coming forward with a galaxy-looking stream of knives, he looked like a god. Every Buddha looked hopeless, grey, and devasted. They did not look so cocky and murderous now like when the true gods were trying to help them earlier.

Burning Lamp’s face looked pale. He was holding the causal karma knife and god doll while he said in a trembling voice, “Mister Han, it was my mistake, mistake. It was me being greedy. This knife was indeed created by your knife blank. I will return it to you now. As for this god doll… This is the gift from the geno god list fights. It was a true god treasure reward. I am giving it to you. These gifts are our way of saying sorry. Please let the Buddha live. The Buddha’s ranking is not worthy of the identity of your race.”

“I gave you and the Buddha a chance, but now it is too late.” Han Sen waved his hand. Tens of thousands of knives descended on the Buddha’s race spirit.
