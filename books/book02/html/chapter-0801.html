    <p>
      Han Sen felt as if he was being bullied by two legendary elites. Not a
      single second went by, without his life dangling by a thread.
    </p>

    <p>
      The spirit&#8217;s speed was so high, it might as well have been
      teleportation. Coupled with the armored phantom&#8217;s indestructible
      greatsword, Han Sen could do little but dodge, dodge, and dodge some more.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen&#8217;s proficiency with dongxuan movement was as high as it could
      go, and with the aid of his dongxuan aura, he was able to predict the
      movements of both of his aggressors. Thus, Han Sen was able to remain a
      single step ahead of his opposition.
    </p>

    <p>
      It wasn&#8217;t easy, however, and the pressure from his enemies continued
      to mount. One tiny little misstep was all it would take to land him in a
      fatal predicament.
    </p>

    <p>
      But Han Sen stayed as focused as he could. He couldn&#8217;t afford to be
      distracted, and all idle thoughts were cast from his mind. The fortitude
      of his mind went entirely into perceiving and predicting exactly which foe
      would do what at any given second.
    </p>

    <p>The spirit was so fast that he was entirely reliant on prediction.</p>

    <p>
      The armored phantom&#8217;s weapon was unbelievably sharp, and since he
      couldn&#8217;t withstand or deflect it, dodging was his only lifeline
      versus it, as well.
    </p>

    <p>Slash!</p>

    <p>
      Another blade-swing fell towards him, and this time, Han Sen was unable to
      dodge it entirely. The back plating of his armor was torn off, and it led
      to him bleeding heavily.
    </p>

    <p>Pang!</p>

    <p>
      The spirit now appeared at Han Sen&#8217;s left, and her manic fist
      punched towards his heart. He could only half-dodge this, too. Her fist
      was driven into his arm, instead, and his shoulder was instantly
      dislocated.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen bit down on his teeth and tried to maintain his composure. He
      couldn&#8217;t afford to slow down, so he continued to dodge. As he went
      on, he healed any wounds he incurred with his holy light.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Come on, fairy. Hurry up! I can&#8217;t hold out much
      longer,&#8221; Han Sen pleaded within. His fitness had yet to reach the
      level of a celestial being. Dealing with one of these villains might have
      been fine, but competing with two simultaneously was too much.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen&#8217;s back received a punch by the spirit, and he was launched
      fifty meters into the sky. With Aero, he altered the trajectory of his
      fall to avoid the follow-up attack that was set to be delivered by the
      armored phantom.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen knew if this was to continue, he&#8217;d be dead well before the
      fairy finished up with the snake. He didn&#8217;t want to rely on her
      help, either, so he turned his thoughts to how he might prevent the
      attacks of his assailants.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen started to use Aero more and more. With the vast amount of space
      he had, he could utilize it for greater formations and subsequent
      predictions.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen&#8217;s heart was galloping like mad, as energy started to
      generate within his arms. Once his mind calmed, his judgment and outlook
      were brought clarity. With this, the situation slightly improved.
    </p>

    <p>
      But only by a little bit. Under the oppression of two wretched foes such
      as these, no matter what Han Sen did, he&#8217;d be at a disadvantage. A
      single mistake was enough to end his life.
    </p>

    <p>
      Every time they attacked now, however, Han Sen sustained more wounds.
      Although they weren&#8217;t deadly, they put him in greater danger through
      their debilitations.
    </p>

    <p>
      The Devil-Ant King armor was damaged now, as well. If this was to keep up,
      it could shatter. If that occurred, then his situation would hit rock
      bottom.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen emptied his mind and focused on his judgment. As he did so, he
      tried to lure them into a trap he was formulating. With his heart and mind
      free from the burden of thought, the damage he&#8217;d receive could be
      minimized.
    </p>

    <p>
      As Han Sen used his dongxuan aura, his appearance was inherently bloody.
      It was as if he had taken a dip in a pool of blood. His eyes were still
      solid, however.
    </p>

    <p>
      During the time spent practicing Hand of God and sparring against Qin
      Xuan, this was what he had been preparing for. This was the true life or
      death trial of his dongxuan aura, but even in the midst of the brutality
      of what was unfolding, his ability with it was actually improving.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen&#8217;s mind was not occupied with a single other thought, and
      although he had sustained more wounds than ever, never before had he been
      so relaxed.
    </p>

    <p>Boom!</p>

    <p>
      Suddenly, Han Sen felt as if his head blew up. A strange sensation
      overtook his mind, as if the very core of his mind was extending. He was
      becoming one with the dongxuan aura.
    </p>

    <p>
      In this stage, the spirit and the armored phantom&#8217;s movements became
      entirely predictable. It was like he could easily view and foresee a trail
      of exactly where they planned to go and how. Even though Han Sen could not
      see the spirit prep her frenetic attacks, he could dodge them with ease.
    </p>

    <p>
      It was difficult to describe what he was feeling, but Han Sen knew now
      that he had reached the pinnacle of what was possible with the dongxuan
      aura. It was most certainly as good as the eighth sense. He had reached
      the zenith of perception.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen&#8217;s body felt at ease. Under the oppression of two wretched
      monsters, he could dodge perfectly and even find the time to fight back.
    </p>

    <p>
      Still, there was no point in him fighting back. And doing so would be a
      needless depletion of energy.
    </p>

    <p>
      But Han Sen was still exuberantly happy over his development. All he would
      have to do now was stall the advance of his enemies, and once the fairy
      was done with the snake, she could come over and help. That would change
      the tide of the battle.
    </p>

    <p>
      The spirit was now starting to understand what was going on. Although they
      were both stronger than Han Sen, they were unable to do anything to him.
    </p>

    <p>
      If this continued, they realized that the fairy would be done with the
      snake and things would end up unfavorably for them.
    </p>

    <p>
      The spirit frowned, and it seemed as if it issued an order to the phantom.
      The armored phantom turned around and departed. It ran over to the snake,
      seeking to support it.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen&#8217;s face changed. He knew he could not allow the armored
      phantom to go support the snake.
    </p>

    <p>
      Gritting his teeth, Han Sen ran up the stairs. He planned to run up to the
      spirit hall.
    </p>

    <p>
      The eyes of the spirit flashed, and it immediately picked up its speed in
      an attempt to stop Han Sen.
    </p>

    <p>
      Left and right, Han Sen&#8217;s body bobbed and weaved without reprieve.
      He kept dropping red herrings of movement to mislead the spirit. Although
      the spirit was physically faster than him, she could not stop Han Sen on
      his ascent towards the spirit hall.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen thought the spirit would call the armored phantom back, so he
      could maneuver for more time and give the fairy the chance she needed to
      finish off the snake.
    </p>

    <p>
      But the spirit did not do this; she did not call for the return of the
      armored phantom. She stopped moving, and a darkness swelled and consumed
      her eyes.
    </p>

    <p>
      In that moment, the pupils of the spirit became wider. The white of her
      eyes turned black, and it seemed as if a strange, dark light swirled
      inside.
    </p>

    <p>
      Her black armor suddenly looked as if it was on fire, and it was wreathed
      in what appeared to be a black flame. It looked quite similar to Han
      Sen&#8217;s Devil Unicorn smoke.
    </p>

    <p>
      Within that black fire, the spirit&#8217;s lifeforce became much more
      powerful. As he noticed this, Han Sen&#8217;s heart jumped, unable to
      imagine what sort of power brewed within the spirit that gave him chase.
