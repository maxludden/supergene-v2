	<p>Destroyed Leader had been killed during another race’s fight. They were not even connected to those events, but
		they were heavily damaged.</p>

	<p>The Destroyed were the fifth high race. There were many true gods in the Destroyed, but Destroyed Leader was the
		leader of them all. He still had the highest power and was the most revered.</p>

	<p>To the three high races, the death of a true god did not greatly affect their power. The Destroyed were
		different. The loss of a true god meant they were half-dead. Some factions that wanted to attack the Destroyed
		were now on the move. It made the Destroyed’s race descend into chaos.</p>

	<p>Godfather Han Sen’s name was like a sun in the sky of the universe. Previously, Godfather Han’s name was a little
		bit playful. Now, whenever a creature mentioned Godfather Han, it was less of a joke and more of a name of
		terror.</p>

	<p>Making a true god a butterfly class and turning a deified Burning Lamp into an ordinary creature was wild. Other
		creatures were always scared of deified elites, but they were like kids in front of Han Sen. The power he
		wielded was enough to scare the entire universe. Godfather Han became a new term in the universe.</p>

	<p>“What kind of power was that?” A Very High Elder frowned in thought. He was given the task of capturing Han Sen
		and returning him to the Very High. Because of Destroyed Leader’s involvement, he did not go and take action. He
		waited until Han Sen turned Destroyed Leader into butterfly class and Burning Lamp into a commoner. Even the
		Very High Elder was shocked. He did not dare approach Han Sen.</p>

	<p>In fact, it was not only the Very High feeling that way. Many elites were shocked by Han Sen’s Xuan Yellow Sutra.
		No one dared to do anything.</p>

	<p>Plus, they were not sure that Han Sen was butterfly class because the Xuan Yellow Sutra was not enough to turn a
		true god into a commoner. He could make them drop a level for a temporary amount of time.</p>

	<p>If Northern Light Alpha and the others had attacked Han Sen together, there was nothing Han Sen could not. They
		would have had to retreat far away.</p>

	<p>They were shocked by what Han Sen could do already. Han Sen turning Burning Lamp into a commoner was too scary.
		They did not understand how powerful Han Sen was. No one dared to come and stop Han Sen from lighting up the
		crystallizer’s lantern.</p>

	<p>Han Sen would have liked to get rid of Northern Light Alpha and the others, but he was not powerful enough to do
		that yet. It was already difficult for him to light up the race lantern.</p>

	<p>“Who did the crystallizers offend before? Why would any elite want to try and stop the crystallizers from
		ascending their status?” Han Sen did not understand.</p>

	<p>Back in the sanctuaries, Han Sen noticed the humans of the sanctuaries were not affected by the crystallizer’s
		race lantern. He felt a bit relieved.</p>

	<p>Han Sen understood that the sanctuaries and the universe had different rules. The two places were not connected,
		but he was still worried.</p>

	<p>He brought a human elite to the universe, and the human immediately generated an armament. He was made a Baron,
		and the crystallizer’s race mark appeared on his forehead. After becoming a Baron, the race mark started to
		fade.</p>

	<p>“Of course, after entering the big universe, you will be affected by the geno hall’s rules,” Han Sen thought.</p>

	<p>With Space Garden as a base, Han Sen’s power in the universe was already quite good. Han Sen did not need to
		worry about too much anymore. He brought as many xenogeneics, creatures, and humans to Space Garden as he could.
		They all used Space Garden’s resources to quickly develop.</p>

	<p>Making a race powerful was not something that could be done solely by one person. If he wanted humans to be
		powerful in the universe, he needed everyone to become stronger.</p>

	<p>It was just Space Garden though. No matter how many resources there were, they could not become a top high race
		through them alone. Han Sen needed a hundred or a thousand xenogeneic spaces that were similar to Space Garden
		to compete to make humans and the others that supported Han Sen able to attack the high race.</p>

	<p>Han Sen was taking his first step forward, but it was the hardest step.</p>

	<p>After that, Han Sen no longer remained in Space Garden. Although it had many resources, they were just primitive
		xenogeneic plants. It was not enough to support the growth of butterfly elites, such as Han Sen.</p>

	<p>It was not just Han Sen. Even Huangfu Jing, who was larva class, needed to find more resources to keep leveling
		up.</p>

	<p>Han Sen was hesitant, but he decided to use Holy Baby’s identity to return to the Extreme King. He needed to be
		there so he could become a true god faster.</p>

	<p>The real Holy Baby was stuck in Space Garden. Holy Baby was being very honest. He spent some time with the
		Six-Ear Macaque. He had been following Bao’er a lot. He kept calling Bao’er “Sister Bao’er” to make her feel
		good.</p>

	<p>Han Sen did not know what went on while he was away, but he knew Holy Baby was suppressed by Bao’er.</p>

	<p>Han Ling’er’s forehead had the crystallizer mark on it, but she was the same as Bao’er. She had not leveled up.
		Han Sen, who lit up the lantern, was very much the same. He had not leveled up either. He only received a few
		benefits via his genes.</p>

	<p>Han Sen again used the Four Sheep Cube as a springboard. He successfully used the Holy Baby’s identity to
		infiltrate Nine-Defense Palace. He was planning to go and see Time Ghost at palace number 0002.</p>

	<p>Time Ghost was a deified class xenogeneic. If he was able to kill it, it would help fill up Han Sen’s deified
		genes. It would make it easier for him to become true god. Han Sen was thinking about how to become true god. He
		used the Sky God Crown to look inside the geno hall and see if there was any difference.</p>

	<p>He went to the palace that held Time Ghost inside, who was still sitting. It was retrained by the traps, but it
		did not look as if it wanted to move or even look at Han Sen.</p>

	<p>Han Sen knew the xenogeneics there had their spirits removed. Although their spirits could be reborn, they were
		trapped there for a long time. Their new spirits seemed to be weak. Their intelligence was very low.</p>

	<p>Han Sen drew his Sky Vine Radish God Lance and thrust it at Time Ghost. Time Ghost seemed to feel the power
		inside the Sky Vine Radish God Lance, so it opened its eyes and looked at the lance heading straight for him.
	</p>

	<p>A power was emerging from Time Ghost. One could not even see how it spread. The tip of the Sky Vine Radish God
		Lance was going to pierce Time Ghost’s chest, but that small distance suddenly seemed enormous. Han Sen was
		striking for a long time, but the tip had yet to reach Time Ghost’s chest.</p>

	<p>“Time power?” Han Sen was shocked. In the binding of the restraints, Time Ghost was still able to make use of
		powerful time powers. It was no wonder it was considered a top-class time element xenogeneic.</p>
