<p>“Qin Xiu, that asshole! How many life souls did he create?” Han
Sen looked around. He started to think every single island there
would have had some scary existences lurking in wait.</p>
<p>Han Sen’s heart jumped. His body appeared on an island. It was
one island in Sky Palace, but Han Sen did not remember the name of
the island. It was an ordinary, floating island in Sky Palace. The
name was not particularly remarkable.</p>
<p>Now, the island was draped in an eerie mist. It had a scary
murder aura develop around it, which unsettled his nerves.</p>
<p>Han Sen went to the island. He saw a purple crystal on it. The
crystal statue was very weird. There was a purple crystal cross on
its back.</p>
<p>The cross had a purple crystal statue that was tied up by purple
crystal chains. The statue looked rather human, but there was one
wing on its back.</p>
<p>Yes, there was just one wing. Only the left side of the statue
had a wing. The right side was empty. There was nothing at all.</p>
<p>The purple crystal statue lifted its head. The purple crystal’s
eyes flickered with a weird light. It looked at Han Sen and said,
“I cannot believe you dared to come back.”</p>
<p>“Do you recognize me?” Han Sen looked at the purple crystal
statue. He did not recall seeing this person before.</p>
<p>The purple crystal statue weirdly laughed. “Before, I and my
life soul had just started to combine. It was just for breaking the
world. We were not to be your enemy. I could only watch you shine
in the White Jade Jing. Now, things are different. I have perfectly
combined with a life soul. It will be easy to kill you.”</p>
<p>“Interesting.” Han Sen smiled and looked at the purple crystal
statue. He did not strike. He wanted to see how strong it was after
combining with a life soul.</p>
<p>“Soon, you will think this is not interesting,” the purple
crystal statue said. It suddenly moved. The cross it was tied to
with the purple crystal chain suddenly shattered. The purple
crystal statue was like a living being. It floated there with the
one wing on its back folded. It had a mysterious, strong impact on
one’s vision.</p>
<p>Han Sen looked at the Break World beast and said, “I have to
confess that you do look quite strong. Having said that, I find
myself unable to accurately gauge exactly how strong you are.”</p>
<p>“You cannot know what my power is like because when I strike,
you will already be dead.” The purple crystal statue walked
forward. One hand was in front of its chest. It slowly raised it to
a position above its head like one would do with a blade. It then
came slashing at Han Sen.</p>
<p>That slashing power was like it was in space. There was no power
involved.</p>
<p>Han Sen raised his left hand. It looked as if he had just moved
it randomly. He broke the thing that was in space, and a sky full
of purple crystal with it.</p>
<p>The purple crystal statue’s face changed. “You can break my
deadly knife light. You are good, but no matter what, today is the
day you die.”</p>
<p>When the purple crystal statue spoke, its body had a killing
aura purple flame. Its body turned into a weird and purple
scythe.</p>
<p>The wing was the blade of the scythe. The purple crystal
statue’s body became its handle.</p>
<p>Han Sen had seen this from Zhao Ning’er and the light stream
dragon spear. That was not strange. It had a Break World rate of at
least 30%. It was a Break World beast with solid power.</p>
<p>“Die!” The purple crystal statue turned into a reaper’s scythe.
It tore through space and went straight for Han Sen. It was so fast
that Han Sen could only see a purple light.</p>
<p>Han Sen did not use full power to kill the Break World beast. He
only let Jadeskin break the world. His entire body became a holy
body.</p>
<p>He waved at the purple crystal scythe. The icy and jade hands
hit the purple crystal scythe and made the purple crystal scythe
fly away.</p>
<p>Jadeskin’s Break World rate was lower than 30%, and the purple
crystal scythe was above 30%. He did not know how strong Jadeskin
was.</p>
<p>The purple crystal scythe turned into a light. It spun around
Han Sen fast and kept on attacking him. It was like an invisible
big hand waving.</p>
<p>Han Sen used Jadeskin to fight. He kept fighting the purple
crystal scythe, fending him off. It was unknown how many times he
was hit, but there was eventually a “katcha” noise. The purple
crystal scythe’s blade was cut by Han Sen’s hand. The broken purple
crystal came out from the broken part.</p>
<p>The purple crystal scythe ceased its assault. It reverted to the
shape of a statue again. There was a broken part on the solo wing.
The feathers on the edge were cracked.</p>
<p>The purple crystal statue’s face did not look surprised. It had
a weird smile.</p>
<p>“You are already dead.” The purple crystal statue’s face smiled
harder. It was like it was an evil ghost looking at a dead man.</p>
<p>“How am I supposed to when I die?” Han Sen laughed and looked at
the purple crystal statue.</p>
<p>The purple crystal statue laughed weirdly as if it was insane.
“I said that before I strike, you are already dead.”</p>
<p>With that crazy laugh, the purple crystal statue put out a hand.
A purple crystal chain appeared in its hand. On the other end of
the purple crystal chain, it had tied up Han Sen.</p>
<p>The purple crystal chain was releasing an evil purple flame. It
was like a toxic snake from hell. One was not able to accurately
describe how toxic and evil this thing was. It was like it was
alive.</p>
<p>“Come. Let your soul become my food.” The purple crystal statue
pulled the purple crystal chain. According to the thoughts of its
heart, when it pulled, Han Sen’s soul would be ripped right from
his body.</p>
<p>After it pulled, Han Sen just stood where he was. He was unable
to be yanked. There was no reaction. His soul was unable to be
pulled out of his body.</p>
<p>“This has a soul attack power, so your power is very unique,”
Han Sen coldly said. “It is a shame that you encountered me of all
people.”</p>
<p>Even the geno tablet wanted to take his soul, but it had not
worked. Therefore, how could a Break World beast be expected to do
it?</p>
<p>The purple crystal statue looked glum. It had tried its hardest
to yank the purple crystal chain, but Han Sen’s soul was not going
to budge.</p>
<p>Han Sen grabbed the purple crystal chain. His muscles expanded.
He suddenly broke the crystal that came from the purple crystal
chain.</p>
<p>He put out his hand. The purple crystal statue was pulled
forward by Han Sen.</p>
<p>Pang!</p>
<p>Han Sen’s fist struck the purple crystal statue that was flying
toward him. It broke the chest of the purple crystal statue. The
purple crystal statue’s face was twisted. It looked shocked.</p>
<p>Han Sen did not move. He kept punching with his fist. He kept
punching the purple crystal statue. He broke the purple crystal
statue. A crystal that looked like a single teardrop fell out of
the being.</p>
<p>“Killed Break World beast: extreme purple dead god. Got Break
World gene.” Han Sen heard the announcement play in his head.</p>
<p>He had not gotten a beast soul though, which greatly
disappointed Han Sen. A soul-element power was rare. Even though
that purple dead god’s Break World rate was only 30%, which wasn’t
too high, its soul power was scarier than a Break World beast with
a Break World rate of 60%.</p>
