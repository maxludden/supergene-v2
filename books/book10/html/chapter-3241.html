<h3>Chapter 3241</h3>

<p>It was very quiet inside the old temple. There was still a scary
light being released, along with subtle chanting.</p>
<p>“Jing Zhen is hoping we can take back the dragon air,” Jing Zhen
prayed again.</p>
<p>The chanting in the old temple came to an end. An old voice was
heard. “My King, go back.”</p>
<p>Qin Jing Zhen’s face changed. He looked at the old temple and
insisted, “Alpha, I am the leader of the Qin Kingdom, and I am
asking you to take back the dragon air.”</p>
<p>The old voice sighed. “My King, you do not have long. The Qin
Kingdom requires the aid of the An Yang Ting. You should just
return.”</p>
<p>Qin Jing Zhen’s face looked as pale as snow. His body shivered.
He looked angry. As if he had been wronged, his disposition became
one of utter hatred.</p>
<p>“Father,” Qin Bai quickly moved to hold Qin Jing Zhen. He looked
worried, so he shouted.</p>
<p>He did not seem to know what that meant, and he did not know
what Qin Jing Zhen was doing. He could tell that whatever his plan
was supposed to be, it had failed.</p>
<p>Qin Jing Zhen waved his hand and signaled for Qin Bai not to
speak. He looked to the old temple and slowly said, “I just wanted
to ask if I was still the king of the Qin Kingdom or</p>
<p>not.”</p>
<p>“Yes, but you are dying,” the old voice said. “There are things
you should let go of. Otherwise, you will find yourself hurt. Go
back now and I will pretend you did not set foot in here on this
day.”</p>
<p>Qin Jing Zhen did not speak. He stared at the holy light of the
old temple. His face looked very conflicted. It could not be
described.</p>
<p>Qin Jing Zhen gnashed his teeth and said to Qin Bai, “My Son,
please take me away from here.”</p>
<p>Qin Bai was naive, but he was not so playful at this moment. He
held Qin Jing Zhen and departed the old temple.</p>
<p>“Blergh!” After leaving the old temple, Qin Jing Zhen hadn’t
gone too far before being unable to contain his emotions. That, in
addition to the fact that he was very injured, resulted in him
coughing up blood all across the dusty, stone street.</p>
<p>“Father!” Qin Bai was shocked.</p>
<p>“I am OK,” Qin Jing Zhen said as he raised his head. “Let’s just
go. I am not dead yet. I am still the Qin Kingdom’s king.” He wiped
away the blood and observed the monastery ahead.</p>
<p>Qin Jing Zhen and Qin Bai went back and kneeled three times. Qin
Jing Zhen said, “I, Qin Kingdom’s king, Qin Jing Zhen, brought my
son to greet the alpha. Please take back the dragon air.”</p>
<p>Inside the shining monastery, a voice of a holy and serious
woman was heard. “Jing Zhen, why are you so stubborn? You are the
Qin Kingdom’s king, and your son will become the Qin Kingdom’s
king. Why must you care about anything else?”</p>
<p>“Jing Zhen is asking you to take back the dragon air.” Qin Jing
Zhen gnashed his teeth and prayed.</p>
<p>“Go away.” From the monastery, only those two words were heard.
Then, there was silence.</p>
<p>Qin Jing Zhen’s eyes looked as if they were on fire. He did not
say a word. He merely stood up. He had Qin Bai hold him and take
him around all sorts of old, shining buildings. Everywhere he
prayed, he received a rejection.</p>
<p>Inside those old buildings, the strongest elites in the Qin
Kingdom were gathered. The people in the Qin Kingdom with the most
important blood were there. The Qin Kingdom selecting a king did
not boil down to their potential. They did not depend on their
powers. They only saw if they were capable of being a king. To
protect these old buildings, they had to be the strongest of a
generation.</p>
<p>No matter how strong the Qin family members were, if they made a
promise to go to the old buildings, they would lose their
identities and become old building guardians. They were the last
line of defense for the Qin family.</p>
<p>Because they had no name or title, they were only a part of the
Qin family. So, Qin Jing Zhen had no choice but to call them
alphas.</p>
<p>In this last defense, one needed the leader of the An Yang Ting
and the king to start it. That was how the Black Dragon Promise
began. The An Yang Ting leader who had the black big evil dragon
king would receive the black dragon buff. They would become the
strongest in the Qin Kingdom. They would beat out everyone.</p>
<p>Now, Qin Yuan alone had started the Black Dragon Promise, and
the Qin Kingdom’s people protecting the old buildings still went
ahead to use the Black Dragon Promise. Even when Qin Jing Zhen, who
was the actual king, came out to request a shutdown of the
operation, it was rejected. They really wanted to keep Qin Yuan and
kill Han Sen.</p>
<p>Qin Jing Zhen and Qin Bai prayed everywhere they went. Qin Jing
Zhen’s face started to look pale. It was, without a doubt, because
he was dying. The Qin family’s people had given up on him, who was
the king.</p>
<p>“Qin Jing Zhen, stop being so ridiculous. You are a king, and
you are a king that was chosen by us. You should face your death
like a real man. Do not ruin the fate of the Qin Kingdom because of
what you want.” In an old place, a serious voice was speaking. “Qin
Jing Zhen is asking the alpha how I will destroy the fate of the
Qin Kingdom.” Qin Jing Zhen looked pale, but he was calm. He looked
at the old building as he spoke.</p>
<p>“Mirror Moon is a miraculous treasure,” a voice from the old
place said. “It can bring people back to life. You are the Qin
Kingdom’s king. For your own sake, you give it to other people.
That alone proves how weak you are.”</p>
<p>Qin Jing Zhen laughed and said, “My Alpha, Mirror Moon has
remained in Candle Garden for the longest time. Who has ever used
it to revive anyone? Who has it ever benefitted?”</p>
<p>“It is merely because it is not yet the time,” the voice from
the old building replied.</p>
<p>“If no one is ever benefitted by it, it is useless. I am using
it to get a few extra years of my life to do more for the Qin
Kingdom. What can be wrong with that?” Qin Jing Zhen clenched his
fists.</p>
<p>“No matter what, Mirror Moon is so important that it cannot be
allowed to fall into the hands of an outsider,” the voice from the
old building said. The tone was cold and heartless.</p>
<p>“Does that mean my life is worth less than that gene race?” Qin
Jing Zhen was sad. “You do not have much time. You should let go
when you are supposed to.” The voice in the old building sighed.
“Qin Jing Zhen, go back. Do what you can and leave the rest to Qin
Bai.”</p>
<p>Qin Jing Zhen’s voice trembled. His eyes were deprived of hope.
Nothing more could disappoint him now. “For as long as I am alive,
I am still the king of the Qin Kingdom,” Qin Jing Zhen coldly said.
He grabbed Qin Bai and returned to the palace.</p>
<p>Qin Bai wiped his tears away as he asked, “Father, is Han Sen
going to die?”</p>
<p>Qin Jing Zhen was silent. He was ashamed. He was the king of the
Qin Kingdom. He was the greatest king in the universe, yet he could
not save the life of a single soul. This was also taking place in
his kingdom and on his own turf. What kind of humiliation was
this?</p>
<p>In the sky, Qin Yuan looked at Han Sen like a god. The black
dragon gave him a power that let him destroy the universe. Han Sen
was no threat to him now.</p>
<p>“Han Sen, what do you have to say for yourself?” Qin Yuan
stepped forward with the whole world suppressing Han Sen.</p>
<p>Qin Yuan did not represent one person. He was representing
everything and the entire history of the Qin Kingdom. He was the
base of the Qin family now. Even if a sky full of God Spirits came
down, it would not change the Qin Kingdom because the Qin Kingdom
belonged to the Qin family.</p>
