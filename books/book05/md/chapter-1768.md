Blergh!

Hawei opened his mouth, and blood leaked over his lips. The arrow neatly punctured his heart, bringing him down to the ground. He kept twitching, and his faint breaths would only sustain himself briefly. Death would soon claim him.

Nicai felt cold. One Baron had ambushed two Viscounts and killed one with relative ease. If Nicai hadn’t seen it with his own eyes, and the arrow used wasn’t his, he wouldn’t have believed something so outrageous had occurred.

“Is this guy from a higher race than the pirates? If he isn’t, I don’t see how he has managed to last so long.” Nicai’s mind couldn’t stop racing. Few creatures possessed genes that were perfect enough to do what Han Sen was doing.

Han Sen didn’t spend much time in thought, though. He pulled the arrow out of Hawei’s chest, as more blood continued to gush and the man’s lifeforce waned.

He brought the arrow back up to the Gold Feather Bow, pulled the string, and took aim at Nicai.

Nicai gritted his teeth and pulled out another arrow, so he could take aim at Han Sen.

After all this, Nicai knew there was no turning back. If he wanted to survive this, the only way to do so would be by killing Han Sen.

When it came to archery, Nicai was very confident He had to be; otherwise, his geno weapon wouldn’t have been a bow. This was practically his life.

Han Sen’s arrow was strong, but Nicai didn’t think he’d lose in competition against him. That was because he could use the Drillhead skill, as well. His power was stronger and faster because his bow was better.

Nicai was confident that if they both were able to fire, Han Sen would be the one to die.

Nicai went silent and drew his arrow. The head of the arrow possessed a halo, imbued with all the strength a geno armament could give. It made his arrow stronger, to provide it greater piercing strength.

Even Viscounts with heavy shields for a geno armament could not block the arrow.

Han Sen went silent, staring down at the fingers Nicai was using to hold the arrow in place. Slowly, Han Sen pulled his string.

The Gold Feather Witch’s beast soul bow was only Baron class, so it wouldn’t be as strong as Nicai’s. That being said, it was enough for Han Sen.

Boing!

Two arrows launched from their perches at the same time, making it sound like only one string had been drawn and released. Two arrows flew out with a severe drilling force. They were like vipers, cutting the air with a speed that made them disappear from sight.

The most unbelievable thing about all this was that the viper-looking arrows met with each other in the air. The snake-like arrowheads collided with each other.

But Nicai’s speed and power were greater. So, when the arrows came against each other, it was at a distance that was closer to Han Sen.

Nicai didn’t expect this to happen, but he was delighted by it. He had been worrying about how he might dodge Han Sen’s arrow, but now he no longer had to consider it

The power he had put into his arrow would be enough to break Han Sen’s projectile. They were both drilling arrows, and his speed and power were stronger.

The spinning arrowheads impacted like two drills coming against each other. The arrowheads sparked like there was lightning contained in the two.

At that moment, a victor was determined between the two arrows.

One arrow was like a ragged cloth from a washing machine, and it was tossed aside. The other arrow, after the impact, did not slow. Instead, it sped up and cracked the sky.

Nicai was shocked. He couldn’t understand why his arrow had been defeated, despite the fact Han Sen should have had less power. Han Sen’s arrow didn’t slow down, it sped up; that was against the laws of physics.

Before he could think, the arrow was before him at a blinding speed. Nicai had almost been unable to dodge, and he pulled out a knife from his waistbelt and tried striking the arrow mid-air.

The arrow was brimming with power, and it went off-course to avoid his block. It was as if the arrow had come alive.

“You want to deal with me like this? You are too naive!” Nicai shouted. He grabbed his bow and threw it at the arrow and then, the arrow flew away.

Just as Nicai was feeling better, he turned back to look at Han Sen, and his eyes opened wide. His pupils shrank to the size of a needle, and his face was stiff with fright.

The shadow of an arrow was growing bigger in his eyes, and Han Sen had only just finished firing and was lowering the bow.

“My arrow, why is it here?” Nicai thought, right before the arrow he fired blew through his head.

Pang!

Nicai looked back, and he did not understand why the arrow he had fired had shot him. Then he was dead.

Han Sen came before Nicai’s body. He took the arrow back and put it away, thinking it was some good stuff. Unlike the Archangel Bone Arrow which was ridiculously difficult to make use of, these new arrows made for good weapons in the hunting of a Viscount xenogeneic.

Han Sen’s arrows were not as strong as Nicai’s, but the Yin Yang Blast he used allowed Han Sen’s attack to borrow Nicai’s power. It sped up a second time.

But even so, he couldn’t kill Nicai with his attack. The man was too good with Drillhead. So Han Sen made his target the fired arrow.

After a swift calculation, and after he used Yin Yang Blast to hit the arrow, he calculated that the arrow would fall into his hands.

Han Sen had grabbed the arrow and silently fired back at Nicai. By the time Nicai noticed this, it was too late.

When it came to raw power, Han Sen was not as capable as Nicai. But Han Sen was the master of skills and techniques. He was not weak in the geno universe, and already he was better than Viscounts like Nicai.

Han Sen looted Nicai and Hawei’s bodies, and he found some good stuff. Then, he chucked their bodies into the water before running back into the forest

In front of Old Dragon Rock Mountain, Mister Elephant was riding a white elephant. He looked at the dragon-like mountain. “Sir, why are you risking this? Why are you going to provoke Old Turtle?” The white elephant addressed Mister Elephant. “You think I’m here for Old Turtle?” Mister Elephant said, looking deep and cold.

White Elephant was shocked, and it said, “Old Turtle should be the only one on Old Dragon Rock Mountain. Are there any other xenogeneics?”

“Old Turtle used to follow Heavenly Pirate. I can’t see why else why that woman from Pirate would come here and break the vows,” Mister Elephant said calmly. He looked at the mountain with passion.
