<p>Han Sen returned to his home in the Alliance. He wanted to test
Glasses on his daughter Han Ling’er and see how much potential she
had. Soon after trying, though, he was forced to acknowledge that
you could never tell how much potential a human had. It would
always say the genes of a human were unstable and unable to be
determined.</p>
<p>The creatures could have their potential and blood calculated,
though. The results were promising, and some of them had a
five-star gene potential.</p>
<p>Because they hadn’t reached deified class, though, five stars
were the highest their potentials could go. After becoming deified,
their gene potentials could be tested again, and thus the tests at
that time would be more accurate. It was like there was a
distinction between those who were deified and those who
weren’t.</p>
<p>“No wonder the elites didn’t want me before. Now it makes sense.
Are the genes of humans really that unstable?” Han Sen
wondered.</p>
<p>“Daddy… hug hug…” Ling’er was able to talk pretty well. She
reached out her pale little hands as she ran to Han Sen.</p>
<p>“My little baby, let daddy kiss you.” Han Sen lifted Ling’er and
kissed her on the cheeks.</p>
<p>When he wasn’t trapped, Han Sen came back every day to rest. He
had been trapped inside the core area for many days, though, and so
he hadn’t seen his family.</p>
<p>Ling’er was a good kid, and she didn’t cry much. The family did
a good job of protecting her, as well. After she was born, she
hadn’t used her super god spirit again. That came as a relief to
Han Sen.</p>
<p>Small kids and too much power was a bad combination. Ling’er
hadn’t yet learned how strong her powers were, and so she hadn’t
yet learned how to harness them. If her mood spiraled out of
control, it would be a dangerous and frightening thing.</p>
<p>Luckily, Ling’er had a very calm personality, and the family was
able to take care of her. So, nothing had gone wrong in his time
away.</p>
<p>Han Sen hoped Ling’er would be able to grow up like an ordinary
child. He wanted her to have a normal childhood. The last thing he
wanted was for her to reach the complexities of adulthood too
soon.</p>
<p>He rested at home for the night. The next day, he gathered a few
cases of wine and took it to the core area. Now that the small
Crocodile God had allowed him to leave, that meant it was likely he
would be able to leave again in the future. Han Sen wasn’t in a
rush to get out of there, anyway. He wanted to spend more time
digging and see what else there was to find in the fortress.</p>
<p>Han Sen returned to the core area. When he arrived, the little
Crocodile God ran frantically over to Han Sen. It roared at him
repeatedly, its tone strange and wandering. Perhaps the crocodile
was complaining about him being too slow.</p>
<p>“I was looking for that wine for you. I needed some time, as
this stuff is very precious.” Han Sen opened a barrel of wine,
allowing the intoxicating fragrance to suffuse the area.</p>
<p>The small crocodile’s eyes brightened. It stopped whining at Han
Sen and jumped straight into the barrel of wine.</p>
<p>Huge plumes of steam came from the wine barrel, and a second
later, the wine was all dry. The small Crocodile God jumped out.
Before Han Sen could open up the next barrel, the Crocodile God was
already jumping inside.</p>
<p>Han Sen soon realized that the Crocodile God didn’t want to use
the wine for drinking. The crocodile wanted to bathe in it.</p>
<p>“I have heard of women enjoying baths of milk, but I’ve never
heard of a crocodile wanting to bathe in wine.” Han Sen couldn’t
help but smile as he watched the enthusiastic little creature. The
crocodile’s scales were very hot, and although it had already tried
to cool itself down, the wine was vaporized almost as soon as it
entered the barrels. It was unable to take its time and swim around
in the barrel’s contents.</p>
<p>In no time at all, it went through a few barrels of wine. The
small Crocodile God came out of the last barrel and roared softly
at Han Sen. It seemed as if it wanted more. He wanted Han Sen to
return and collect more wine for it.</p>
<p>“This is a very rare treasure. It took me a while to gather
these few barrels, so if you want more, you will have to wait a
long time,” Han Sen said.</p>
<p>Han Sen had many barrels of wine in storage, and he could easily
buy a few vineyards. He couldn’t spoil the small Crocodile God,
though. He had to plan for the long term.</p>
<p>Han Sen brought two or three barrels for the crocodile each day.
It was enough to keep the small creature happy, but it wasn’t
enough to keep it satisfied.</p>
<p>Now, Han Sen no longer had to work. The small crocodile wanted
him to just bring it wine, but Han Sen still stuck to his cleaning
duties. That was because he could dig wherever he wanted without
the explicit command or direction of the little Crocodile God.</p>
<p>Ever since he found Glasses, Han Sen hadn’t discovered anything
useful. His lack of progress was frustrating. He worked in the
fortress for a month, but he didn’t find anything else of interest.
His Jadeskin reached the ninth tier, so he couldn’t level up
anymore even if he continued to consume King xenogeneic genes.</p>
<p>Han Sen then focused on his Blood-Pulse Sutra, leaving The Story
of Genes as the last to be leveled up.</p>
<p>Exquisite and Li Keer were so depressed. They could see Han Sen
coming and going as if the place was his own backyard. They wanted
to leave, too, but no matter how much they tried talking to the two
Crocodile Gods, they weren’t permitted to go anywhere.</p>
<p>They tried to use the wine retrieval excuse, but the Crocodile
God wasn’t interested in what they had to offer. This made them
incredibly sad.</p>
<p>Han Sen didn’t know why the Crocodile Gods treated them
differently, but everything was panning out perfectly for him. Han
Sen actually thought it was convenient that the two of them were
still trapped. If they got free, they might cause him problems of
some sort.</p>
<p>“The Very High are nothing that special. They can’t even deal
with a transmutation deified. They are worse than the Ancient God,”
Han Sen thought to himself.</p>
<p>Actually, Han Sen only thought this because he hadn’t learned
the nature of their strength. The power of the Very High didn’t lie
purely in their combat abilities, and they had nearly limitless
resources. If the Very High survived long enough, they could become
butterflies with ease. That was better than most races.</p>
<p>Since he still wasn’t managing to dig up any worthwhile items,
all Han Sen achieved was making the small Crocodile God an
alcoholic. Han Sen kept giving it wine, but the creature never
drank it. It used every barrel for bathing. It sickened Han Sen to
see so much fine wine be wasted. No matter how rich he was, it hurt
to see something so precious be poured down the drain.</p>
<p>Han Sen examined and excavated the whole fortress, but he didn’t
find anything useful. He hadn’t even been able to find the body
that the arm had been attached to. It seemed as if only the arm had
been left behind.</p>
<p>“It looks like I need to find a way out of here.” Han Sen wasn’t
interested in delivering wine to the Crocodile Gods for the rest of
eternity.</p>
<p>“Lady Exquisite, didn’t you say that your elders would come and
save you? When are they going to come?” Han Sen found a chance to
stop by and talk to Exquisite and Li Keer.</p>
<p>“I’m not sure. It could take two or three months, or it could
take a couple of years,” Exquisite said.</p>
<p>“Why would it take them so long?” Han Sen was shocked.</p>
<p>Exquisite didn’t answer Han Sen’s question. Actually, the Very
High had self-spells coded into their bodies. If they were in
danger or injured, the self-spell would awaken. If they died, the
self-spell would self-destruct, and people were sure to know
something had happened to them.</p>
<p>But Exquisite and Li Keer were neither injured nor in danger.
The self-spell wasn’t going to ring its alarm. If the Very High
people didn’t hear anything from the self-spell, they’d have no
clue that something had happened to the two women.</p>
<p>After a while, if Exquisite remained missing, the people of her
race would notice her absence. They knew where she had gone, but it
was hard to determine when they would notice her absence.</p>
<p>While the two women were wallowing in their depression, Han Sen
set out a grilled goose to munch on. He ate it and drank, picking
through a side of fruit as well. They wanted to eat some, too.</p>
