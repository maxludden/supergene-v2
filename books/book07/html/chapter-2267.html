<h2>My Opponent Isn“t a Student</h2>
<h3>Chapter 2267</h3>

<p>Han Sen jumped onto the blood kirin’s back. Then, the blood
kirin roared and flew towards Ice Blue Knight King and the
others.</p>
<p>“Ignore those other guys and kill him first,” Han Sen
instructed, thrusting his Thunder God Spike toward Ice Blue Knight
King.</p>
<p>Instead of answering, the blood kirin simply kept roaring as it
headed for Han Sen’s target.</p>
<p>“Charge!” Ice Blue Knight King called to the Ice Blue Knights as
he swept his greatsword at the blood kirin.</p>
<p>The blood kirin paid no mind to the other Knights, though. The
Knights had previously exploited the blood kirin’s stupidity to
land a few blows, but now that the creature was following Han Sen’s
commands, they found themselves having to give the creature an even
wider berth.</p>
<p>“Han Sen, if you keep this up, you will never be allowed back
into the Ice Blue Knights!” Ice Blue Knight King shouted, watching
an Ice Blue Knight get torn to shreds by the blood kirin.</p>
<p>“I’ve already quit the Ice Blue Knights. Do you really think I
plan to return after all this? When you guys decided to fight with
me, you should have said your prayers and readied yourselves for
death!” Han Sen shot back.</p>
<p>Ice Blue Knight King did not speak again. He had treated Han Sen
as Yisha’s student. He thought of Han Sen as a junior, and he had
never thought he would have to take the young man as an enemy.</p>
<p>Even though Han Sen had betrayed the Knights, Ice Blue Knight
King only wanted to teach him a lesson as a senior Knight. He
wanted to grab Han Sen, take the slate, then haul Han Sen back to
his rightful place in the Knights.</p>
<p>It was only now that Ice Blue Knight King realized he had been
wrong about Han Sen since the beginning. He never considered Han
Sen as an equal, and it never crossed his mind that Han Sen would
see him as an opponent. Or a competitor.</p>
<p>Han Sen wasn’t a junior who required protection or could be
ordered around. Han Sen was a mighty elite who had exactly what it
took to survive and thrive in that cruel world. He was holding his
own despite the many powerful enemies that wanted him dead.</p>
<p>Ice Blue Knight King’s realization might have come too late. If
he had considered Han Sen as a real threat in the beginning, he
wouldn’t have given Han Sen any chance to escape the base. He would
have taken Han Sen down as soon as possible, and he wouldn’t have
chased after Han Sen alone when he first made his escape.</p>
<p>The blood kirin chased the group back to the hellish skeletal
gate, killing everyone but Ice Blue Knight King, Crime, and one
other Ice Blue Knight along the way.</p>
<p>Han Sen and the blood kirin didn’t dare draw too close to the
gate, though. Han Sen allowed the three survivors to escape. Then,
he went back to the lotus mountain where the blood kirin lived.</p>
<p>“I was foolish. I should have treated him like a genuine
opponent.” Ice Blue Knight King stared at Han Sen, who was riding
away atop the blood kirin. His face was expressionless, showing no
hint of anger or sadness.</p>
<p>From that moment on, Ice Blue Knight King was going to treat Han
Sen like a genuine opponent. To go against a strong opponent,
though, he’d need more than the few students he had.</p>
<p>Crime looked grim. “Is that guy really Yisha’s student? He seems
scarier than Yisha. I fear we may have underestimated him.”</p>
<p>“You cannot blame us for that. Who would have assumed that a
Marquise could pose such a threat?” asked the other Ice Blue
Knight, whose name was Harder.</p>
<p>Harder was feeling rather conflicted at that moment. He and
Edward had been very close, so he knew just how terrifying the man
had been.</p>
<p>Although Edward was just a hybrid Extreme King and his attack
power wasn’t too strong when compared to the rest, his powers of
observation and his movements were splendid.</p>
<p>Harder again envisioned Edward lying helpless under Han Sen’s
attack, and the Ice Blue Knight struggled to find words to describe
what that horrible sight had done to him.</p>
<p>Although Han Sen was just a Duke, no one dared treat him as a
Duke anymore.</p>
<p>Fox Queen met Ice Blue Knight King and the other two at the
gate. She frowned and said, “Where are the others?”</p>
<p>Ice Blue Knight King told her what had happened. He spoke
plainly and without exaggeration, describing Han Sen and the blood
kirin’s power. And he did not hide the fact that his group had well
and truly failed.</p>
<p>“Interesting. Very interesting. The blood kirin became
half-deified that quickly? And Han Sen was riding it in battle?”
Fox Queen squinted her eyes.</p>
<p>She didn’t blame Ice Blue Knight King. After a moment, she said,
“You guys can stay here to aid Mister White in breaking the
restrictions of this place. When I break the chains binding me
here, I can go and take him down myself.”</p>
<p>Back in the blood kirin’s valley, Han Sen allowed Bao’er and the
others to leave Destiny’s Tower and relax for a bit. He also wanted
to discuss their game plan for the coming conflict.</p>
<p>Han Sen had used the blood kirin’s power to defeat Ice Blue
Knight King and the others for the time being, but he didn’t think
they were safe yet. And that made him even more worried.</p>
<p>Edward and the others had been able to find the palace and bend
the restrictions to gain entry. That meant one of them understood
the structure of the palace, at least to some degree.</p>
<p>Fox Queen hadn’t sent Mister White after them, and that was
probably because Mister White knew the most about the palace’s
composition. If he was able to break Fox Queen’s restrictions, then
Han Sen would be in big trouble.</p>
<p>Han Sen stood no chance of defeating an unhampered deified
elite, even if he had all sorts of deified items to use against
her. And now, Han Sen was stuck in the White Bone Hell. The palace
was his only means of escape. Unless he wanted to stay there
forever, he would have to leave through the skeletal gate.</p>
<p>“But the blood kirin is only half-deified. If I could make it
deified, it would be easy to ride it out and slaughter whatever got
in our way,” Han Sen thought to himself.</p>
<p>Han Sen’s team talked for half the day, but they didn’t come up
with anything that seemed really promising. Han Sen decided to
focus his efforts on absorbing all the Ghost Bone power he could.
He hoped to get The Story of Genes to Duke class. The more power he
had, the better his chances of survival would become.</p>
<p>“Even if Fox Queen really does manage to escape, she won’t kill
me if she can’t find what she wants. That means I might still have
a chance.” As Han Sen rested, he fidgeted with the stone plate. He
kept thinking about how things might play out.</p>
<p>The blood kirin and Han Sen were very comfortable with each
other by this point, but only Han Sen could get close to the beast.
The creature’s presence was too menacing. It looked at everyone
else like slabs of meat. The blood kirin looked likely to jump
forward and gobble them up at any second.</p>
<p>Han Sen kept practicing with The Story of Genes. A month went
by, and The Story of Genes was progressing quite well. It was still
a long way away from becoming Duke, though.</p>
<p>Suddenly, the whole of White Bone Hell began to shake, and Han
Sen heard Fox Queen’s voice coming through the hellish skeletal
gate. “My good little brother! Your big sister is coming to find
you.”</p>
<p>Fox Queen stood in front of the gate, and the metal shackles
were still visible on her neck, arms, and ankles. The metal chains
that connected to the shackles, however, were gone.</p>
<p>Mister White, Ice Blue Knight King, Crime, and Harder stood
behind Fox Queen. It was like they were now her people.</p>
<p>Fox Queen’s aura spread across the White Bone Hell, searching
for Han Sen. But suddenly, two shadows appeared from the mountains.
It was Han Sen and the blood kirin. That surprised her. She had
expected Han Sen to try to escape, not come looking for her.</p>
