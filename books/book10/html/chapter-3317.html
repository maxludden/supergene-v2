<p>Han Sen felt bad. “The Story of Genes’ Forever Solid power could
not prohibit the invasion of the gene messages.</p>
<p>Han Sen noticed his body was exhibiting many weird changes. Some
little red hairs started to develop on his skin. It was like his
hair had turned red.</p>
<p>He stopped hesitating. He opened his Super God Spirit mode,
which enabled his body to turn into a spirit body that looked like
nothing.</p>
<p>The boiling feeling within his body disappeared. It was gone,
but many light dots still flickered across Han Sen’s spirit body.
It lost the body’s support, so the points of light fell away. They
became the light spell Han Sen had seen before.</p>
<p>The light spells could no longer find their target. They
flickered and returned to the geno tablet. They disappeared.</p>
<p>Han Sen sighed. He thought it would be over. Suddenly, the geno
tablet started to glow. The two words, “Geno Tablet” looked like a
sun in the sky. They were glowing very brightly.</p>
<p>It was like Han Sen’s Super God Spirit mode was meeting a strong
magnet. It was sucked against the geno tablet.</p>
<p>Han Sen tried his best to fight back, but it did not work. His
body hit the geno tablet.</p>
<p>Han Sen, via reflex, used his hands to protect his head and
brace for the strong impact against the stone. Surprisingly, he did
not feel any pain. It did not feel as if he was going to strike
anything from being pulled. His body was pulled inside the geno
tablet.</p>
<p>It felt as if he was going into a pool of water. It was like he
wasn’t hitting the stone tablet at all. It was like a lake. Han
Sen’s entire body was submerged in it.</p>
<p>Han Sen opened his eyes with shock. He noticed it was a galaxy
that was like a sea of stars. Countless stars were flickering. It
was like a sea. It created some beautiful star swirls and star
waves.</p>
<p>As Han Sen took a closer look, the stars looked weird. The stars
had a connection with a wire that looked like it was there, but it
was not there. It created a weird chain of stars.</p>
<p>Han Sen was shocked. “Does it mean these stars are the basis of
the star chains? If the stars in the universe are the basic chain
of a gene chain, does that mean the whole universe is like a life
force? How great such a life might be.”</p>
<p>Han Sen only had that idea for a second. The possibility for
that being true was quite low. Han Sen just randomly had that idea.
It was just an idea. He could not believe something like that could
actually happen.</p>
<p>Even if the universe really was a life force, that would be a
completely different life force compared to ordinary life.</p>
<p>Han Sen thought, “This should be the interior of the geno
tablet. What did the geno tablet pull me inside for?” His body had
been sucked in by the power. He went through oceans of stars. He
kept going through the star sea, descending deeper into it all.</p>
<p>Han Sen did not know how long he had been flying inside that
endless expanse of space. He saw many stars and wires that looked
like they were there, but they were not there.</p>
<p>The wires connected the stars and gave them a weird shape. It
was completely different. The stars and the wires there did not
look like they had a rhythm, but they looked very peaceful.</p>
<p>Suddenly, Han Sen’s eyes looked bright. The sharp light made him
subconsciously use his hands to shield his eyes. When his eyes got
used to that light, he put his hands down.</p>
<p>Upon witnessing what was before him, Han Sen’s eyes opened wide.
He saw a giant planet at the center of the countless stars.</p>
<p>The planet looked very odd. It was like there was a transparent,
crystal layer covering the ocean. Through the crystal, one could
see the liquid. There was also a shadow that looked like it was
something, but it was not something.</p>
<p>The weird planet was becoming smaller yet expanding with
rhythmic order. It was like a heart that was beating.</p>
<p>The giant planet gave Han Sen the feeling that it was like… Han
Sen was shocked. He screamed, “Why does it look like a fetus?”</p>
<p>When Han Sen came before that weird planet, the strong magnetic
force stopped. It was not all gone though. Han Sen’s body remained
floating in front of the large planet.</p>
<p>He did not know if he was mistaken, but Han Sen felt that inside
the weird planet, beyond the crystal layer and inside the liquid
ocean, there was an eye staring back at him.</p>
<p>“What a shame. You are not the life we have been waiting for.” A
voice played in Han Sen’s brain.</p>
<p>Yes, it was a voice that sounded in his brain. It did not come
through his ears to his brain. It would have made anyone feel
weird.</p>
<p>“Who are you?” Han Sen calmly asked.</p>
<p>“I am me. You can call me the geno tablet.” The voice was there
again. It went on to say, “You are the third life force to come
here, but you are still not the one I have been waiting for.”</p>
<p>Han Sen’s heart jumped. He asked, “Who are you waiting for?”</p>
<p>“I do not know,” the voice replied.</p>
<p>“What does that mean? What do you mean you don’t know?” Han Sen
was curious about this. That was both his pro and con.</p>
<p>“I do not know how to explain to you what that life force is.
Even if I told you his gene message, with your life and layer, you
cannot compare to those gene messages. It will be hard for me to
confirm his identity to you.” Although it sounded very cocky, it
did not make Han Sen feel as if the geno tablet was being cocky. It
looked as if it was speaking the truth.</p>
<p>“In that case, he must have a name,” Han Sen said.</p>
<p>“A name? Do you mean a title?” the voice asked.</p>
<p>“Yes,” Han Sen replied.</p>
<p>“If it just a title you are looking for, I remember his name was
Chaos.”</p>
<p>“Chaos?” Han Sen frowned. He had never heard of a person with
that name before, but he was no stranger to the meaning behind the
name. His heart jumped. “Chaos… God Chaos Party… It cannot be the
leader of the God Chaos Party, can it?”</p>
<p>“He did call himself a leader of a God Chaos Party or
something.” The voice sounded in Han Sen’s head again. It shocked
him.</p>
<p>Because he was thinking in his head, he did not speak. Yet, that
voice seemed to be able to read his mind.</p>
<p>“Do not be shocked,” the voice calmly said. “Here, I can see all
the gene messages from life forces. You can use your language or
your thoughts. It does not make a difference.”</p>
<p>“I am the third life that came here. So, who were the other two
that arrived here first?” Han Sen did not care about the geno
tablet being able to read his mind.</p>
<p>“If it is just a title you are looking for, the title of the
first one who came here was someone called God,” the geno tablet
answered.</p>
<p>Han Sen thought, “A guy who calls himself God. Is he the Geno
Hall Leader? Is it the leader right now or the leader from before?
I assume it would be the leader from before.”</p>
<p>This time, the geno tablet did not reply to what Han Sen
thought. It went on to say, “The second person who came here called
himself a Wu Wei Dao person.”</p>
<p>When Han Sen heard that, he was shocked. “A Wu Wei Dao person?
Is that the Wu Wei Dao Alpha from Wu Wei Dao Palace?”</p>
<p>“I think he said he came from the Wu Wei Dao Palace,” the geno
tablet said.</p>
<p>Han Sen tried to contain his excitement as he asked, “What was
he doing here?”</p>
