      “I told you to move! Did you not hear me?” Gu Qingcheng’s face darkened.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Elysium wore cloaks that obscured their faces. They lowered their
      heads and did not vocally object to her repeated command, but still, they
      did not move. Standing where they were, they were blocking Han Sen’s exit.
    </p>
    <p>
      “It looks like the politics of Elysium Shelter are quite complex. Gu
      Qingcheng is not one-hundred percent in charge. And because Elysian Moon
      isn’t all that popular, my hostage isn’t invaluable,” Han Sen thought to
      himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Gu Qingcheng, you are the master of the shelter! You should think about
      the Elysium. If the human can simply walk out so boldly, how can we expect
      to survive and maintain our strength in the Fourth God’s Sanctuary?” A
      voice echoed across the shelter, and the spirits then divided their ranks
      to form a path.
    </p>
    <p>
      A spirit with a grey cloak and a black staff was approaching. When the
      spirits saw him, they bowed and exclaimed, “The Big Priest!”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Why is there another big priest here? How many priests do they have?” Han
      Sen looked at him and frowned. Strangely, Han Sen could not detect a
      lifeforce from him. It was as if he was inspecting a dead man walking.
    </p>
    <p>
      Gu Qingcheng, seeing the spirit, frowned and said, “Priest, this is my
      business! I don’t need your lectures.”
    </p>
    <p>
      The priest laughed quietly. “I, Ghost Holy, followed Elysium King in the
      Fourth God’s Sanctuary for an untold number of years. We engaged in many
      battles and became the priests that nurtured many holy children. Elysium
      is my life, and nothing is more important to me than upholding all this.
      Even if you are the leader of the shelter, if you ever tried to do
      something to embarrass me, I would forbid it.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Then what must be done to avoid this embarrassment?” Gu Qingcheng said,
      looking at Ghost Holy.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Elysium will not be threatened by humans. We must kill all who try,” the
      Big Priest said.
    </p>
    <p>
      “You would really prefer Elysian Moon to perish?” Gu Qingcheng looked at
      him with disdain.
    </p>
    <p>
      The priest was fearless in his response. “Every holy child of Elysium must
      attain further glory for us. If they fail, even they cannot be allowed to
      embarrass us any further. If they cannot be saved, dying for the
      betterment of Elysium is the most glorious thing they can attain.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “What if I have to let him go?” Gu Qingcheng looked at the priest
      implacably.
    </p>
    <p>
      “You want to let him leave? Over my dead body,” the priest said with a
      modicum of cruelty.
    </p>
    <p>
      Gu Qingcheng looked at Ghost Holy before addressing Han Sen again. “Leave
      now, and I will see to those who might dare stop you.”
    </p>
    <p>
      Han Sen knew this would be his last chance for freedom. Elysian Moon,
      being a hostage, only seemed to affect Gu Qingcheng. He listened to what
      she told him and proceeded on towards the gate.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the spirits at the gate did not part for him, and Han Sen realized
      they were most likely going to side with the priest. Han Sen was going to
      walk right in front of them. If the crowds did not part for him, he’d have
      no choice but to swing his sword.
    </p>
    <p>
      But before he did, another powerful sword cleaved through the masses to
      form a way for Han Sen. Many of the Elysium spirits were instantly
      annihilated.
    </p>
    <p>
      Han Sen was shocked by the sudden spectacle. He turned around and saw Gu
      Qingcheng’s hand grasping a green sword with the delicateness of a fairy.
      The strike had come from her.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Gu Qingcheng, do you dare to kill those of Elysium? Do you truly think we
      fear you?” The priest was enraged by her actions. He brought his staff
      down on the ground as the Elysium-borne powers began to rise.
    </p>
    <p>
      “You guys were afraid of me for two years. Isn’t this rebellion a little
      late?” Gu Qingcheng said icily.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Fine, Gu Qingcheng. I will let you witness the true power of Elysium.
      Kill the humans! None will be leaving Elysium Shelter today!” The priest
      raised his staff as the entire shelter was consumed by a void of
      nothingness.
    </p>
    <p>
      Han Sen understood now that it was the priest who controlled the spirits,
      truthfully. The spirit stone inside the spirit hall’s statue had to be
      his, no doubt.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the order was received, the eyes of all the spirits became
      frightening. Their bodies all turned gray, as if they were hell-raised
      minions.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Elysium did not have an elder, but there were many king-class spirits
      amongst the horde. Twenty of them had super geno cores, while the rest had
      gemstone geno cores.
    </p>
    <p>
      The power they unleashed was wretchedly powerful, and it even made Han Sen
      a little nervous. Fighting individual king spirits wouldn’t be difficult
      for Han Sen now that he had his Butterfly geno core. But their numbers
      were so grand, getting out would still prove a major problem.
    </p>
    <p>
      Han Sen put away his useless umbrella. He summoned his Bulwark Umbrella
      instead, determined to use that alongside Taia. He was ready to fight. Han
      Sen watched another strike come from Gu Qingcheng’s direction. It was so
      bright, and it slammed right into the gate.
    </p>
    <p>
      The gate had been hewn open in two, kicking up a murky haze from the
      debris. The way outside was now clear.
    </p>
    <p>“Get out of here!” Gu Qingcheng shouted.</p>
    <p>
      She didn’t say his name, but Han Sen knew she was speaking to him. His
      butterfly wings glowed red as he started flying out of the shelter through
      the curtain of fog.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Gu Qingcheng, how dare you!” The priest was further enraged. His body
      exuded a horrible aura, and he swung his staff towards Gu Qingcheng.
    </p>
    <p>
      Some of the king spirits took off after Han Sen, following him out of the
      shelter.
    </p>
    <p>
      Han Sen did not stop, and with his butterfly wings, he employed the grace
      of his phoenix techniques. But the king spirits were incredibly fast, and
      his evasive maneuvers weren’t losing them.
    </p>
    <p>
      Elysium Shelter was shaking with thunderously loud noises, as if the
      entire place was falling to pieces. Most of the Elysium, and the priest,
      had been locked inside the shelter.
    </p>
    <p>
      “She is so strong! Who is she? Is she really a human?” Han Sen was shocked
      by it all. He did not think a member of Blood Legion could be that strong,
      either.
    </p>
    <p>
      Han Sen didn’t have time to think about such things, though. Right now, he
      was flying fast. He rushed forward, determined to return to the
      Underworld.
    </p>
    <p>
      Gu Qingcheng had appeared before him in the Underworld before. She was not
      of the Elysium, and so it was highly likely those who were would have to
      abide by the Hundred Tribe Deal. If they did not follow the rules and
      break off when Han Sen entered the Underworld, Dark Spirit would have no
      choice but to teach them a lesson.
    </p>
    <p>
      There were six spirits coming after Han Sen, all king spirits wielding
      super geno cores.
