  Han Sen and the others were incredibly free to as they wished. After Han Sen heard that something weird happened there, he planned on taking Bao’er there to dig. He did not believe the land pulse could harm them.

If there was a god pulse that could shock the world, perhaps they could find a rare gene egg there. Han Sen was lacking in those.

He chatted with Sky King. When Sky King heard about his plan, he felt very happy about it. “You guys go and dig! You can keep every gene egg you dig up. There is no need for you to share it with us.”

A few tens of thousands of miles away, half of the river was underground. The radiation’s radius was wide. There were many land pulses there. There were as many as there were hairs on cows. Han Sen and Bao’er, the father and the daughter, prepared to go dig. There were so many land pulses that they could have probably dug there for the rest of their lives.

Therefore, Sky King was not too worried about them digging up all the gene eggs. After they entered, his army would be able to go in and dig if they broke the Snake Turtle Hide formation. He knew how to calculate that.

Even if Han was unable to break it, it did not do any harm to Sky King. He would be doing Han Sen a favor, and that was cool too.

“Old Han, I will go with you guys,” Bald Guy said while chomping his teeth.

“Why are you coming with us?” Han Sen asked. “Do you have any idea how dangerous that place is?”

“If you guys are not scared of it, then I am not scared either,” Bald Guy madly said.

Han Sen thought, “Of course, we are not afraid, but you are different. Your body is too weak. If you cannot endure the Snake Turtle Hide, you are going to die.” Han Sen did want Bald Guy to go with him. Bald Guy said, “If I do not go with you, will you be able to read land pulses? Do you know where and how to locate gene eggs? Do you know how to dig them up?”

After Han Sen heard that, he was shocked. That was a big question. Even if they knew there was good stuff to be found along the river, they could not dig up every inch of it. The gene eggs were different from other things. Before they hatched, they were weak. If Han Sen used too much strength while digging, the gene eggs might break with the soil he toiled.

“Let’s go together,” Li Bing Yu suddenly said. “I have a way to protect Bald Guy.”

“What is your plan?” Han Sen and Bald Guy looked at Li Bing Yu with surprise. It was a formation that not even Mister Wei was able to break.

Li Bing Yu coldly said, “Don’t you guys look at me like that. I am sure Mister Wei knows about this method too, but it can only make one or two people unaffected. It will not work for many people, so a large-scale digging venture is out of the question. Although, just having a few people won’t allow us to dig up much.”

“What is this method?” Bald Guy quickly asked.

“I have a gene race called a repel evil rhino,” Li Bing Yu said. “After combining with it, even if you are in danger, you will not be affected. It only works if you combine with the repel evil rhino. Other people will not be protected.”

Bald Guy was shocked. “The repel evil rhino is a treasure the mister uses to dig into land pulses. I cannot believe you have one too. But there are four of us. One evil repel rhino will not be that helpful.”

Li Bing Yu replied, “Han Sen said he has his own way, and I have other gene races to use. You can use the repel evil rhino.” She then transferred the repel evil rhino to Bald Guy.

Bald Guy accepted the repel evil rhino. He looked surprised. “The repel evil rhino is just king class, but it is extremely rare. Any mister who receives one would think of it as a most valuable treasure. My teacher has one, but not all the students do. I cannot believe I, Bald Guy, can use a repel evil rhino today.”

“I am only lending it to you temporarily,” Li Bing Yu coldly said. “I don’t need it forever,” Bald Guy merrily said. “Using it just once in my life is enough of a privilege.”

The four of them readied themselves and set off for the river.

“Old Han, is it really OK to bring Bao’er?” Bald Guy was worried about Bao’er.

“Don’t worry,” Han Sen casually said. “I have a way to keep Bao’er safe, but it only works on those who share the same blood as me.”

Before the four of them reached the river, they saw a group of people digging up land pulses ahead of them.

“This is a small world.” When Bald Guy saw them, he spat on the floor.

The person who was commanding the people digging up a land pulse was Brother Three.

Brother Three saw them approaching. He rode a big bird over to them. He had a remarkably different attitude. From afar, Brother Three smiled. “Brother Xia, where are you and Mister Han going? I am familiar with this place, so I can lead the way for you.” Bald Guy was surprised. He had never seen Brother Three talk to him in this way before. He then realized why Brother Three was willing to change his attitude.

Bald Guy did not expose Brother Three’s thought process. He looked like he was smiling at him, but he did not smile at him. “We are planning to dig up gene races near the river. Are you interested in going?”

When Brother Three heard that, his face changed. He smiled. “That place is too dangerous. If you want to dig up gene eggs, this area has enough land pulses as it is. Why go somewhere so dangerous?” Bald Guy laughed. “Digging normal land pulses does not show ourselves off as students of Mister Wei. If you do not go there, then we will go.”

After that, Bald Guy summoned the repel evil rhino. He rode atop the rhino, staying behind Han Sen.

Upon seeing the repel evil rhino, Brother Three’s face cycled through a variety of colors. He looked super jealous.

“Good. That felt good.” After walking far away, Bald Guy laughed loudly.

Li Bing Yu coldly said, “By behaving like that, it is only a matter of time before someone stabs you in the back someday.”

Bald Guy did not care. He said, “He has been stabbing me in the back enough as it is. I have been learning from Teacher all these years, but he has never stopped bullying me. Now, I have what it takes to fight back.”

“We are almost there,” Han Sen said to Bald Guy. “Combine with the repel evil rhino just in case something happens.”

Bald Guy selected the repel evil rhino and combined with it.

Bald Guy was very strong. After combining with the repel evil rhino, his body was stronger. He was like a slab of meat. His nose possessed a silver rhino horn. The four of them entered the 300-mile radius of the river.

No matter what a person did, experience was always necessary. Before, Bald Guy did not have land-pulse experience. Although he had learned a lot, when it came to getting down to it, it never panned out too well.

Now, he kept digging all kinds of land pulse. He had many special land pulses. His level was certainly increasing, and his skills were certainly improving. After having a look, he discovered a land pulse near the river.

Han Sen could not feel if there was anything different there. He dug up a few land pulses and found something. He obtained a dozen gene eggs. Three of them were king class.

Bald Guy suddenly pointed at Han Sen’s neck and asked, “What is that on your neck?”

“What?” Han Sen took out a mirror and checked himself out. He noticed his neck had a very small, black line. If he had not examined it closely, he would have thought he was wearing a black necklace.
