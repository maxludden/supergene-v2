    <p>
      Han Sen tried a couple of times, but even &#8220;Dollar9527&#8221; was
      registered as well.
    </p>

    <p>
      Feeling quite upset, Han Sen wrote &#8220;Kill Dollar&#8221; in his ID
      name, which was eventually usable.
    </p>

    <p>
      After entering the virtual platform, in front of Han Sen&#8217;s chest
      there was a shiny purple badge in the shape of a shield, which represented
      the identity of sacred-blood aristocrats. Anyone could tell he was a
      sacred-blood aristocrat at first sight, so there were a lot of envious
      glances cast his way.
    </p>

    <p>
      Although at this day and age, there were much more sacred-blood evolvers
      than there were before, the percentage of sacred-blood evolvers was still
      low.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen chose to be randomly matched and was soon matched with someone.
      Seeing there was a sacred-blood badge on the chest of his opponent as
      well, Han Sen felt quite pleased.
    </p>

    <p>
      Wang Dongyun checked out his opponent and found the ID name was
      &#8220;Kill Dollar.&#8221; Wang Dongyun curled his lips and felt even more
      amused when seeing his record was zero win and zero loss.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Kill Dollar? A newbie like you does not even deserve to be killed
      by Dollar.&#8221; Wang Dongyun licked his lips, wondering how he could
      teach this new be a lesson to show him he should be more careful with the
      ID name he used.
    </p>

    <p>
      Dollar was a celebrity, so you could fashion your name after him. But
      don&#8217;t take yourself so seriously. Kill Dollar my ass.
    </p>

    <p>
      Wang Dongyun became a sacred-blood evolver in recent years as well, so he
      knew the name of Dollar, who was so famous that it was hard for him not to
      know.
    </p>

    <p>
      Wang Dongyun was quite a fan of Dollar&#8217;s, so he was even more upset
      when seeing this ID.
    </p>

    <p>
      After the fight began, Wang Dongyun did not hesitate to use the explosive
      punch that he was best at, ready to kill this arrogant newbie that dared
      to insult Dollar.
    </p>

    <p>
      However, when he threw half a punch, he suddenly saw his opponent throwing
      a fist at him as well. Although the strike was not that fast, Wang Dongyun
      had to retreat. Otherwise, before he could hit his opponent, he would be
      punished first.
    </p>

    <p>
      Taking back his fist sullenly, Wang Dongyun stepped back at the same time,
      preparing to kick the newbie&#8217;s ass later.
    </p>

    <p>
      However, after this punch, Wang Dongyun was shocked to find that he never
      had another opportunity to make an attack. The strikes from his opponent
      never stopped, making him feel suffocated. If felt he had to dodge or
      block every punch from his opponent, and there was no opportunity for him
      to fight back.
    </p>

    <p>
      As he blocked and dodged, Wang Dongyun ended up on the edge of the
      battlefield without even noticing it. With nowhere to go, he was finished
      off.
    </p>

    <p>
      Wang Dongyun could not believe that he was not able to make a single punch
      facing a newbie. Unable to accept this kind of result, he challenged his
      opponent again quickly.
    </p>

    <p>
      His opponent clicked yes. Although Wang Dongyun was trying to take the
      Initiative this time around, he quickly ended up in the same situation as
      the last time, unable to fight back at all.
    </p>

    <p>
      Wang Dongyun sent an invite again, while his opponent chose to reject him
      this time. Wang Dongyun insisted, but his opponent had already entered
      another fight, obviously with a new match.
    </p>

    <p>
      Wang Dongyun searched for the room of his opponent and chose to watch. He
      would like to see why that person was able to beat him and why in such a
      strange way.
    </p>

    <p>
      Neither the person&#8217;s speed nor strength was that great. However, he
      was beaten completely, which made him feel reluctant to accept. Wang
      Dongyun checked Kill Dollar&#8217;s opponent, who was named &#8220;I Am
      Sword Master&#8221; with where than a thousand wins and eight hundred
      losses. That was way record. Since this person was a veteran on the
      platform, he was definitely not bad.
    </p>

    <p>
      The moment &#8220;I Am Sword Master&#8221; moved, Wang Dongyun knew he was
      right. This person&#8217;s sword skills were fierce and fast. Judging by
      his moves, Wang Dongyun could tell that this person had put a lot of
      effort into practicing his sword skills.
    </p>

    <p>
      If Wang Dongyun was against this person, he could probably only choose to
      back off and defend himself under such sword skills.
    </p>

    <p>
      However, the choice of Kill Dollar made Wang Dongyun stare his eyes wide
      open. Kill Dollar did not go back at all, but went forward, punching at I
      Am Sword Master. The punch was neither fast nor fierce.
    </p>

    <p>
      In Wang Dongyun&#8217;s eyes, I Am Sword Master could definitely cut Han
      Sen with his sword, but I Am Sword Master chose to retreat, dodging the
      punch from his opponent.
    </p>

    <p>
      Later on, Wang Dongyun felt like he was watching a playback of his own
      match. I Am Sword Master made the exact same choices as himself,
      suppressed by Kill Dollar until the last minute, unable to fight back.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;No way… No way in hell…&#8221; Wang Dongyun almost jumped up and
      yelled. He could not understand why I Am Sword Master would choose to
      retreat in the beginning. Nor did he understand how I Am Sword Master lost
      in the end. From his perspective, there were so many opportunities to
      fight back.
    </p>

    <p>
      In addition, the punches of Kill Dollar were far from perfect. In fact,
      there were even quite flawed. If I Am Sword Master was able to take
      advantage of any of the flaws, he could have turned the situation around,
      which he failed to do.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Maybe I Am Sword Master is too weak? Yes, it is definitely
      so.&#8221; Wang Dongyun thought it must be the sword man&#8217;s problem
      that he could not utilize any of the flaws. Although his sword skills were
      impressive, he must not be that intelligent.
    </p>

    <p>
      However, Wang Dongyun completely forgot that he acted exactly the same
      way. He did not feel he was too weak and did not take his loss too well.
    </p>

    <p>
      I Am Sword Master did not take his loss well either, sending another
      invite to Kill Dollar. He had the exact same thought as Wang Dongyun.
    </p>

    <p>
      However, Han Sen did not agree to fight him again. He was practicing the
      techniques in Dongxuan Sutra, so it would make little sense for him to
      fight someone he had defeated already. What he needed was endless new
      challenges against opponents using various skills.
    </p>

    <p>
      After launching the sneak attack on the royal spirit, Han Sen had a deeper
      understanding of the techniques in Dongxuan Sutra. The techniques did not
      need to be perfect. And there was no victory against overwhelming odds in
      its true sense.
    </p>

    <p>
      If one beat someone much stronger than oneself, one was merely using
      one&#8217;s strength to tackle the stronger person&#8217;s weakness. How
      to hit his opponent&#8217;s weakness with his own strength was Han
      Sen&#8217;s main focus at the point.
    </p>

    <p>
      It would be the best if he could be stronger than his opponent. If not, he
      had to show his strength against his opponent&#8217;s weakness, making
      himself the stronger one, which was the correct way to go.
    </p>

    <p>
      What Han Sen was practicing currently was to use calculation to match his
      strength with his opponent&#8217;s weakness. Even if his opponent was
      stronger than him over all, he could be partially stronger and consume his
      opponent&#8217;s strength in order to win in the end.
    </p>

    <p>
      Wang Dongyun insisted on watching Han Sen&#8217;s fights one after
      another. Soon, he discovered that the reason that I Am Sword Master lost
      was not because he was weak, but that Kill Dollar was too strong.
    </p>

    <p>
      In a dozen fights, Kill Dollar crushed his opponents in the exact same
      way, which was so strange that he was about to question destiny.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Is he Dollar himself?&#8221; Wang Dongyun suddenly thought of a
      question.
