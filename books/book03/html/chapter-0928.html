<p>Heavenly Empress left with Flower Empress, and after they were out of earshot of the others, she asked, &#8220;So, you have a crush on The King?&#8221;</p>

<p>Flower Empress blushed and said, &#8220;It that a bad thing?&#8221;</p>

<p>Heavenly Empress smiled and replied, &#8220;It is not bad, no. But since no one has yet learned his identity, you shouldn&#8217;t get your hopes up about any future hook-up.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am not hoping for anything. He is powerful, that is all; it impresses me a great deal,&#8221; Flower Empress explained.</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s good, then.&#8221; Heavenly Empress smiled and did not say anything else.</p>

<p>Han Sen spent his days in carefree merriment. He amassed large swathes of spirit genes, with little to no effort.</p>

<p>And as fortuitous as this was, it did make him feel as if there were no king spirits around. He thought it was quite strange. He had spent many days there, but had not been challenged or approached by a single king spirit. As such, he didn&#8217;t obtain a single king spirit geno point. It was almost as if they were all avoiding him.</p>

<p>&#8220;How am I supposed to get more king spirit genes, if things continue in such a way?&#8221; Han Sen looked at his rank, noticing he was just below one hundred thousand.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hmph, if you don&#8217;t seek me out, then I will seek you out.&#8221; Han Sen sent away the spirits that crowded around him, and drove off on his island.</p>

<p>As everyone wondered what he was up to, Han Sen went off in search of spirits that were of a higher rank than him.</p>

<p>Han Sen hid his lifeforce with dongxuan aura, so that no one would know he was coming.</p>

<p>When he neared a spirit, he challenged his desired opponent quickly. He raced towards anyone who had a higher rank than him, and when his rank was nearing the realm of numbers populated by king spirits, he stopped.</p>

<p>&#8220;The top hundred must be king spirits. If I kill them one by one, I will be able to obtain a hundred king spirit genes,&#8221; Han Sen cleverly mulled.</p>

<p>He had heard that the top hundred were mostly comprised of king spirits, and since they could not decline his request for challenge, he planned to kill them sequentially.</p>

<p>Han Sen came across a spirit that was rank one hundred and twenty-seven. The spirit&#8217;s name was Storm King. Without any warning, Storm King found himself challenged and immediately dragged into combat.</p>

<p>Storm King had opened his second gene lock, but after a couple of punches, he was killed. From the spirit, Han Sen received a wind geno point.</p>

<p>After that, he found another two king spirits. Following their deaths, he obtained two more fire geno points.</p>

<p>Although he skipped a few ranks between them, there was nothing he could do about that. He tried his best to find spirits that were as close as possible to his rank, but he absolutely avoided those that were one hundred or below.</p>

<p>All of a sudden, he caught sight of a few islands that were headed his way.</p>

<p>It was Flower Empress and The King of Day. With them was another woman spirit he had seen before, but not been introduced to. There was also a person he had never seen before. The male spirit was blonde, and he had fiery, phoenix-like eyes. He looked noble, as if he was stuffed rigid with pride.</p>

<p>When he approached Han Sen, he did not even look at him. All the spirit did was talk with one of the empresses.</p>

<p>Looking at his statue, Han Sen noticed that his number was one. That meant he was the greatest and most powerful spirit in the entire spirit base.</p>

<p>&#8220;The King, do you dare challenge Phoenix King?&#8221; The King of Day coldly proposed.</p>

<p>&#8220;This is Phoenix King?&#8221; Han Sen looked at the blonde man.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes I am. Now cut the crap and fight me!&#8221; Phoenix King looked on Han Sen with disdain.</p>

<p>What Phoenix King said wasn&#8217;t personal; he behaved this way to everyone. He was particularly rude when he wanted a challenge with others.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh my God! This is going to be one hell of a show.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Phoenix King&#8217;s body is indestructible, or so I have heard. Does The King have what it takes to defeat such a foe?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Such a fight will prove, once and for all, whether or not The King is invincible.&#8221;</p>

<p>Phoenix King cawed loudly like a bird, drawing the attention of all the spirits that were near.</p>

<p>Growing excited, they all drew near.</p>

<p>Han Sen squinted. It was like he did not even hear what Phoenix King had told him. Then, Han Sen drove towards one of the islands that was approaching.</p>

<p>The spirit he was headed for was called Lightning King; the spirit had a rank of one hundred and nineteen. When he saw Han Sen coming his way like a rabid dog, though, it was too late for him to turn tail and flee.</p>

<p>He was only going to watch the fight that was supposed to transpire, but in a flash, The King had leapt onto his island with a bloodlust.</p>

<p>&#8220;The King, are you afraid of Phoenix King?&#8221; Flower Empress shouted at Han Sen.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s nice to see you again, Flower Empress. Have you come here to make good on what you owe me?&#8221; Han Sen smiled at her.</p>

<p>She blushed and was robbed of all the words she had intended to taunt him with.</p>

<p>&#8220;The King, why are you running away from Phoenix King? If you are afraid, just admit it. We won&#8217;t force you to challenge him,&#8221; The King of Day said in a sarcastic tone.</p>

<p>&#8220;I can kill that wimp with ease, but I&#8217;m not in the mood today. Perhaps another time?&#8221; Han Sen said, then attacked Lightning King.</p>

<p>Lightning King stood no chance against Han Sen, and he was swiftly destroyed.</p>

<p>After receiving his thunder geno point, Han Sen cruised off on his island, casually. He blatantly ignored Phoenix King and the challenge that was proposed.</p>

<p>&#8220;How obscene. He said it would be easy, but then he just ran off!&#8221; The spirits were frozen, after viewing the peculiar spectacle.</p>
