    <p>
      In the Godlight Tunnel, there was only the super class Yu Miao, Little
      Lion King, Starsea Beast, Han Sen, and Six Paths remaining.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bao’er was in Han Sen’s arms. When Han Sen introduced her to others, he
      would always say she was a pet beast soul. Pet beast souls did not possess
      geno cores, so they wouldn’t feel the pressure experienced in the tunnel.
    </p>
    <p>
      To others, Bao’er could follow Han Sen freely. And if Han Sen could keep
      going, she too would go through all the way. Of course, Han Sen knew
      Bao’er wasn’t actually a beast soul.
    </p>
    <p>
      After crossing the seventeenth Godlight, even Yu Miao and Little Lion
      King—both of whom were super—were under extreme pressure.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yu Miao and Little Lion King looked at Han Sen, and they were surprised to
      see him looking rather relaxed. They were shocked, and they wondered if
      Han Sen’s fitness had actually reached the level of a super demigod. If he
      hadn’t, they couldn’t think of another reason that would explain how he
      had managed to come so far.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was hard to imagine a body that was not super could make it all the way
      here.
    </p>
    <p>
      Six Paths’ face looked a little grim, too. He was feeling the weight of
      the pressure. Han Sen’s faced was still relaxed, though. The effect on him
      was rather minuscule.
    </p>
    <p>
      They were a hundred meters away from the eighteenth Godlight. Yu Miao and
      Little Lion King’s bodies began to tremble, and every step took them a lot
      of effort. ( B oxnovel.c om )
    </p>
    <p>
      The two of them saw Han Sen not looking likely to quit anytime soon, so
      they clenched their teeth and pushed on. They were so slow, though. It was
      as if they were dragging a mountain behind them.
    </p>
    <p>
      Their bones began to creak eventually. Little Lion King roared. He wanted
      to keep going, but his body was no longer allowing him to.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yu Miao was in the same situation. Seeing Six Paths and Han Sen reach the
      eighteenth Godlight, her feet finally felt as if they had been pinned to
      the ground. She could no longer move.
    </p>
    <p>
      “I am already super class. Why is there such a big difference?” Yu Miao
      felt terrible. She tried her hardest, wanting to walk on as Han Sen and
      Six Paths were doing.
    </p>
    <p>
      She managed to move one leg a little further, but its landing was met with
      the sound of a katcha! The other leg had been unable to support the
      weight, and it ended up snapping.
    </p>
    <p>Pang!</p>
    <p>
      Yu Miao fell to the ground and looked up at Han Sen and Six Paths, who
      were managing to proceed even further. She couldn’t get up and chase after
      them as she wished to.
    </p>
    <p>
      Little Lion King roared. He was able to inch his way forward a little bit
      more. He was shaking, and when he was only four meters away from the
      eighteenth marker, the trembling became too violent. He could no longer
      step forward, either.
    </p>
    <p>
      When Han Sen and Six Paths passed through the eighteenth Godlight, the Six
      Paths Sword began to shine like a flower. His geno core had become super
      now.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Six Paths’ geno core becoming super didn’t mean too much, as it had no
      effect on his fitness.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Fuck! I lost. That guy is too strong. How is he doing that?” Little Lion
      King dropped to the floor as he watched Han Sen and Six Paths go through
      the eighteenth Godlight. He gave up trying to support himself further, and
      he simply lay on the floor to see which of the two final contestants would
      win.
    </p>
    <p>
      The others did not know what Little Lion King knew, though. Han Sen’s self
      geno core was the same level as his own when he started, and he had
      already leveled up three times, whereas Han Sen hadn’t.
    </p>
    <p>
      If he only had a silver geno core and his fitness was not super, it was
      scary to fathom how he had managed to come so far.
    </p>
    <p>
      “No matter how special the human’s body is, it cannot compete with Six
      Paths Emperor.” Yu Miao remained where she was, watching the two advance.
    </p>
    <p>
      She did not want Han Sen to go much further, but she didn’t mind Six Paths
      doing much better than her. Han Sen was just a human, after all, and she
      didn’t think much of them. The mere fact he had managed to go further than
      she had was an excruciating fact she had trouble accepting.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Maybe he cannot, but Six Paths looks fairly strained and Han Sen is
      looking the same as ever. I think he’ll end up walking further than Six
      Paths,” Little Lion King said.
    </p>
    <p>
      He hoped Han Sen could walk further. He had lost to Han Sen, and he’d feel
      a bit better about himself if he knew Han Sen was also the sort to beat
      someone like Six Paths.
    </p>
    <p>
      If Six Paths Emperor lost, the Lion King losing to Han Sen would not be so
      embarrassing.
    </p>
    <p>
      Since he had lost the bet, it was established that he would become Han
      Sen’s subordinate. At the very least, he’d be the subordinate of a supreme
      elite. It was far better than ending up as the subordinate of a random
      nobody. ( B oxnovel.c om )
    </p>
    <p>
      Creatures always obeyed the stronger, and the same applied to Jade Little
      Lion King.
    </p>
    <p>
      Six Paths felt the pressure from the Godlight, and he could feel the
      muscles of his emperor body tighten. He was starting to sweat profusely,
      too.
    </p>
    <p>
      He looked over to Han Sen and what he saw shocked him. Han Sen looked as
      relaxed as the moment he first entered the tunnel. There was not a drop of
      sweat on him.
    </p>
    <p>
      “How could this happen? His fitness isn’t super yet, so how can he walk
      through this so easily?” Six Paths Emperor frowned, unable to formulate an
      answer.
    </p>
    <p>
      There were so many elites in the Godlight Tunnel, all possessing different
      elements. They had all become super class while in there, and yet,
      regardless of the power they possessed, it wasn’t enough to withstand the
      pressure of the tunnel.
    </p>
    <p>
      Not even Six Paths believed Han Sen’s power was enough to suppress the
      might of the Godlight. But even so, he couldn’t come up with a reason to
      explain how Han Sen was walking so freely before him.
    </p>
    <p>
      “I am right! He is indeed a special opponent. I’m still looking forward to
      that fight. Once he levels up to super, I will test how strong he really
      is.” Six Paths Emperor’s eyes possessed a fire.
    </p>
    <p>
      Han Sen did not look back at Six Paths. The pressure of the tunnel was
      something he could ignore, but as he slowly reached the end, he felt as if
      something was there up ahead. He could sense something moving, beckoning
      him closer.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Is there a special reason why I’m not susceptible to the pressure of the
      Godlight? What is at the end of the tunnel? And why me?” Han Sen felt very
      confused over these events, but his curiosity had been piqued too. He
      really wanted to see what lay in wait at the end.
    </p>
    <p>
      Han Sen quickened his pace, eager to find out what was at the end of the
      tunnel.
