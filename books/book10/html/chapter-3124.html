<p>Although he had the reverse version of the Cold Sutra, Han Sen did not combine with a gene race for the Cold Sutra. Therefore, he could not practice it.</p>

<p>“If the Cold Sutra and Blood-Pulse Sutra can be reversed, will I be able to reverse The Story of Genes and Dongxuan Sutra?” Han Sen wondered.</p>

<p>At this time, Han Sen did not have the time to do that. He needed gene races. It wasn’t just the Cast God Court that required gene races. If he wanted to reverse geno arts, he needed gene races.</p>

<p>“If Gold Crystal System has a rare gene race, that would be awesome. With Cast Gold Court’s method of making a rare gene race breakthrough, I wonder how strong it might be if it could be combined with a reverse geno art?” Han Sen could not help but let his imagination run wild.</p>

<p>Even if the Gold Crystal System had a rare gene race, there was no guarantee he could find one.</p>

<p>“If I can beat the big sky demon to an egg, perhaps it will go well with the reversed Cold Sutra.” Han Sen thought about the big sky demon.</p>

<p>The big sky demon was too ghostly. She was always coming and going. Han Sen never knew where she was. The chance of turning the big sky demon into an egg was lower than digging up a god pulse.</p>

<p>Li Bing Yu and Bald Guy were still encased in ice. Han Sen used Jadeskin to remove the Cold Sutra’s power on them. They woke up. When Bald Guy came to, he was shocked. He asked, “Who was that woman? She was so scary! Fortunately, you were here, Han Sen. If you weren’t here, it would have ended up very poorly for us. Did you kill her?”.</p>

<p>“I am not her enemy,” Han Sen said with a shrug of his shoulders. “She ran off.”</p>

<p>Night God No Moon had two sets of memories. In each life, she had reached the top of the world. She had combined ordinary and reverse powers into break world power. To achieve that, two universes were required. It would have been hard to find a creature stronger than her.</p>

<p>“Even you could not beat her?” Bald Guy was shocked. His neck shivered.</p>

<p>Li Bing Yu looked at Han Sen strangely. Han Sen and Bald Guy did not know who Night God No Moon was, but she did.</p>

<p>It was a legend just below Qin Xiu, but Night God No Moon was not as famous as Qin Xiu. That was because Night God No Moon had not become the Qin Kingdom’s king. She was merely a teacher.</p>

<p>In the Qin Kingdom, there were a few women grand teachers. Night God No Moon was one who was not as famous. Thus, she had not appeared to be too special.</p>

<p>In Night God No Moon’s era, the Qin Kingdom had turned to a system of law. The king then was called the alpha king. He was the first king. Li Bing Yu had seen the records of Wu Wei Dao Palace. She read a classified file about Night God No Moon. That woman teacher was the one who started the changes in the Qin Kingdom. She was integral to the process of the waning kingdom reclaiming its former glory.</p>

<p>Back then, Night God No Moon took advantage of Wu Wei Dao Palace. Although it was not as bad as being kicked out of the Qin Kingdom, they were restricted. While Night God No Moon was around, the Wu Wei Dao Palace was unable to do anything in the Qin Kingdom. Night God No Moon basically had used them.</p>

<p>Considering a character like that from a legend, and Han Sen turning out just fine, it made sense that Night God No Moon had departed. If it wasn’t like that, it would have turned out quite scary.</p>

<p>“Bald Guy, stop talking. Hurry up and find the land pulse. It is best if we can find a high-class gene race land pulse.” Han Sen was impassioned about finding new gene races.</p>

<p>“Dig! We will be digging, and we have to dig hard.” Bald Guy was emboldened. Han Sen had sorted out a scary woman, so Bald Guy did not think there was anything more to be afraid of.</p>

<p>Bald Guy had been worried about digging up an extremely scary land pulse, especially one they could not have dealt with. After the last ordeal, Bald Guy knew Han Sen was stronger than he had imagined. Since Han Sen said what he had, there was nothing more to be afraid of.</p>

<p>“Let’s go. We should go deeper into the Gold Crystal System. This place doesn’t seem to have a high chance of getting us a rare gene race. Let’s go hunt ourselves something bigger.” Bald Guy gnashed his teeth. Han Sen was speechless. If he knew the chances of getting a god-class gene race here were low, why were they even there in the first place?</p>

<p>Still, it was fortunate Bald Guy had decided to go there. If they had not stopped there, Han Sen would have missed the chance of encountering Night God No Moon. Bald Guy summoned the God Wind Dragon and took Han Sen and Li Bing Yu away from the planet. They went deeper into the Gold Crystal System.</p>

<p>Li Bing Yu quickly realized that Bald Guy was rather useful. Earlier, she had not thought highly of him. She had not thought he understood land pulses. It had actually been because he was afraid of going to Ghost Starlight Land.</p>

<p>Normally, big land pulses were followed by scary weird scenes. No one could have blamed Bald Guy for not wanting to go. Bald Guy led Han Sen to one of the seven places. Ghost Starlight Land was one of them.</p>

<p>The God Wind Dragon had yet to get close to the planet when they saw a group of flying gene race knights patrolling the outskirts of the planet. They were not letting anyone get close to the planet. Clearly, someone rather important had already laid claim to the zone.</p>

<p>When Bald Guy saw them from afar, his face instantly changed. “That is Sky King’s Sky Wing Knights. We should just go somewhere else.”</p>

<p>Han Sen had heard about Sky King before. He was one of the kings who had a different surname. He was one of the ones with authority. He was a highly valuable asset to the Qin Kingdom.</p>

<p>Of course, Sky King was famous because he and his people were nobles through heritage. They had an Annihilation class god temple. Every generation was blessed by the Annihilation God Spirit.</p>

<p>The Gold Crystal System was massive, so there was no reason for Han Sen to start a rivalry with Sky King. He was just going to follow Bald Guy and leave.</p>

<p>They hadn’t gone in a new direction for long when they suddenly heard a scary beast sound come from behind. The three of them looked back. They saw the planet, which was surrounded by Sky Wing Knights, burst with light. The gold god light fired into the sky. The planet, which had a rocky terrain, was suddenly turning into an ocean of lava. The entire planet was like a newborn sun. Its temperature was getting higher and higher.</p>

<p>The scariest part was that there was a green sprout within the burning lava sea. It was growing large vines amid the fire. It quickly developed into a giant vine that was hundreds of miles long. It was still growing fast.</p>

<p>Ordinarily, wood element plants or gene races were afraid of fire, but it was like this giant vine was absorbing fire to grow.</p>

<p>The planet was burning, and the vine was growing swiftly. Not long later, it was around 10,000 miles long. It looked like a green monster resting atop lava.</p>

<p>The Sky Wing Knights on that planet came flying away from it. Many of them were melting from the lava’s high temperature. Not even their bodies remained intact. The knights able to escape felt relieved. Suddenly, vines from somewhere else shot out of the lava and grabbed them. It was shockingly fast. The vines were like a nest of wild snakes. After wrapping up their bodies, the vines pulled them down into the sea of lava. They cried horridly in the lava sea.</p>
