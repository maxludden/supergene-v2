<h2>The Red Mist in the Valley</h2>
<h3>Chapter 1869</h3>

<p>Deep in the mountains on Planet Eclipse, Han Sen, Xie Qing King,
Gu Qingcheng, and Little Silver, were traveling. After Xie Qing
King and Gu Qingcheng became Viscounts, Little Silver became one,
too.</p>
<p>Now Han Sen was depressed. Little Angel, Zero, and he had not
been infected. If they had, it was likely they could have leveled
up to Viscount with much greater ease. They wouldn’t have needed to
practice half as much.</p>
<p>“The environment is stable for now, at least. Why don’t we bring
more people to this universe, so we can grow and cultivate them? It
will be impossible for us to become famous here with only a handful
of people.” Han Sen was deep in thought.</p>
<p>Han Sen could recruit many from the Alliance, but there were a
few he did not feel safe with. One such person was Wang Yuhang. Han
Sen was afraid that if he came here, the man would bring terrible
luck down on him.</p>
<p>Because Han Sen had provided many xenogeneic genes to his
friends and followers, certain people in the sanctuaries had
developed very quickly. But he had made sure to only provide such
things to those who were close to him. Han Sen’s resources were
limited, and he couldn’t fill the needs of everybody he knew.</p>
<p>With the help of xenogeneic genes, though, many humans and
creatures from the Fourth God’s Sanctuary had made it to the
Alliance. That included Dragon Lady, Death Goddess, Red Pony, and
Little Star. They had successfully ascended to the Alliance
universe.</p>
<p>The humans who had successfully ascended included Queen, Lin
Feng, Wang Yuhang, Tang Zhenliu, and Yi Dongmu. They were waiting
to go to the xenogeneic universe now.</p>
<p>Ji Yanran and Luolan had eaten so many xenogeneic genes that
they too had ascended to the Alliance. But Han Sen wasn’t yet
willing to let them cross the divide. He was afraid that if they
were there, they’d cause a big problem for him with their attempts
to find Littleflower.</p>
<p>The advantage of creatures from the sanctuaries was that they
could level up rather quickly by consuming xenogeneic genes. Their
biggest letdown, however, was the fact that their genes were
unstable. There was no telling what a creature might eventually
become.</p>
<p>A xenogeneic that looked like a leopard came prowling out of the
mountains. Gu Qingcheng, with her swordair, killed it in a single
strike.</p>
<p>Gu Qingcheng’s powers were of swordair and not swordlight. Her
green swordair was weird, and it resembled something like silk. She
could kill enemies at all manners of strange angles.</p>
<p>“Save me some!” Xie Qing King blurted, clutching his silver
book.</p>
<p>“You are too slow,” Gu Qingcheng said, as she was in the process
of cutting up the xenogeneic body and harvesting the xenogeneic
genes.</p>
<p>Xie Qing King did not say a word, and he merely closed his
silver book.</p>
<p>Han Sen looked at Xie Qing King. Xie Qing King’s geno armament
and power had been consistently surprising to Han Sen, and they had
interested him quite a bit.</p>
<p>After Xie Qing King leveled up to become a Viscount, he had been
able to use his silver light to draw pictures on the pages of his
book. Whatever he drew could come to life, right out of the
parchment. He could practically summon beasts to fight alongside
him.</p>
<p>But the shadows he drew did have limitations. For one thing, he
couldn’t pre-draw a creature, then cast it when the time for battle
came. So, he had to draw his desired summons during battle, and
that took time.</p>
<p>With Gu Qingcheng there, though, he couldn’t draw anything fast
enough to fight. By the time he finished drawing something, she’d
have killed the xenogeneic already. It was something that didn’t
make him very happy.</p>
<p>Han Sen was happy, though. He wasn’t interested in Baron or
Viscount xenogeneics. He wanted to find light treasure.</p>
<p>“What is this?” Xie Qing King looked up to the mountain,
confusion etched across his face. Han Sen followed Xie Qing King’s
gaze, and they examined a red mist hanging across the mountain.</p>
<p>But the mist hadn’t come from the sky. It arose from the
mountain itself, and it looked rather weird.</p>
<p>“Perhaps we should go and take a look. There could be treasure!”
Han Sen’s eyes shone brightly.</p>
<p>“Careful. We are only Viscounts, remember. If we encounter a
Duke or a Marquise, only Han Sen has a Duke beast soul pair of
shoes that he can use to run. We lack such things,” Gu Qingcheng
said.</p>
<p>“Do I look like the type to run off and abandon you?” Han Sen
was hurt by the comments.</p>
<p>“Yes.” Xie Qing King and Gu Qingcheng answered sincerely.</p>
<p>Han Sen shrugged his shoulders and picked up Little Silver.
Carefully, he snuck towards the place he had seen.</p>
<p>The red mist was like a cloud, but it rippled like a living
fire. It was a stunning sight.</p>
<p>After the three of them got close, they found that the red mist
was rising from a valley. The valley, filled up with that mist,
looked like heaven. What might have lurked beyond the strange
vapor, however, was something they could not see.</p>
<p>“Should we go in and take a look?” Gu Qingcheng looked down into
the valley and frowned.</p>
<p>She could not see anything. The red mist was too thick for their
eyesight to penetrate. It didn’t actually hurt their eyes, but it
did stop them from looking at what was inside.</p>
<p>“I don’t know what lies inside. I’d wager it is too dangerous to
go in, though.” Even with Teeth Rabbit shoes, Han Sen did not want
to take the risk. He was still too weak, and carelessness could
cost him his life.</p>
<p>“Now you can watch me.” Xie Qing King spoke with absolute
confidence. He summoned his silver book and began casting with his
wonderful silver light. He was scribbling something rather
quickly.</p>
<p>Within a second, the shadow of a silver leopard leaped out from
the pages of the book. It looked exactly like the one Gu Qingcheng
had just killed. This one was just a silver shadow, though. It
wasn’t comprised of actual flesh.</p>
<p>“You can draw anything you like with this book?” Han Sen asked
with surprise.</p>
<p>“Yes, but they only stay around temporarily for now. I can only
draw creatures that exist in the universe, too. The drawing has to
be pretty accurate to generate the creature, as well.” After Xie
Qing King said that, he commanded that the leopard head into the
valley.</p>
<p>“If you draw a King class xenogeneic, would it have King class
power?” Han Sen asked.</p>
<p>“Of course not. The shadow’s power depends on the caster’s
strength—mine. That being said, some of the creatures I have drawn
can carry their own element. Still, the power scales back in
comparison to me,” Xie Qing King explained.</p>
<p>“Whoa, that is already so very good!” Han Sen looked at Xie Qing
King strangely.</p>
<p>Xie Qing King was a man with a very bad temper. It was strange
to see him take to drawing in a fight instead of immediately using
his fists.</p>
<p>Roar! The leopard had been inside the mist for a while when an
awful screech was heard. Then, nothing. The valley returned to
silence.</p>
<p>Xie Qing King’s face changed. The leopard drawing in the book
was shattered.</p>
<p>“What happened?” Han Sen asked Xie Qing King.</p>
<p>“I don’t know, but I have a connection with the shadow. I can
feel what they feel, but I cannot see through their eyes. After he
entered the mist, something killed him quickly,” Xie Qing King
said</p>
