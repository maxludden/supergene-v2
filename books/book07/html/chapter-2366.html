<p>Katcha!</p>
<p>The green light flashed. Hell King’s head was cut off.</p>
<p>The strange woman was stunned. She stared at the man who looked
so skinny, clutching that green sword. All the other creatures
around them were dead.</p>
<p>The woman squinted, trying to remember exactly what had happened
when she came out of the black stone. She remembered that the
skinny man had been in the stone factory when she emerged. He would
have been the one she killed first.</p>
<p>But now that she thought about it, she didn’t remember actually
killing him; he had been too ordinary to keep her attention. She
just tossed some red light his way and ignored him.</p>
<p>“He isn’t dead?” The strange woman looked at the man, who was
smiling as he held the green sword. For some reason, when she saw
his smile, the woman wanted to smile with him. It was like his
smile was contagious.</p>
<p>The woman looked at Ning Yue and said, “You are not bad. If you
ally with me, you can use my deified powers. Then, you can become
defied as well. Unstoppable. You will become the greatest in the
universe.”</p>
<p>Ning Yue smiled and didn’t answer. He walked slowly toward the
woman.</p>
<p>“You don’t believe me?” The woman looked intently at Ning Yue’s
face. She knew she should be wary, but she couldn’t resist that
infectious smile. She found herself treating him as a friend rather
than a foe.</p>
<p>“I believe you,” Ning Yue said seriously.</p>
<p>The woman looked relieved. Somehow, what Ning Yue said felt
incredibly trustworthy. His words seemed rock-steady, as if
whatever he said had to be a universal truth.</p>
<p>The woman sighed, and just as she was about to respond, Ning Yue
used the little green sword to lop her head off.</p>
<p>The woman’s head rolled across the ground, with her red eyes
still staring at Ning Yue as if she couldn’t believe what he had
just done.</p>
<p>Ning Yue sighed and said, “I believe you can give me power, but
I cannot beat the one I wish to with power alone. I need to take
this step by step, my way, before I can stand before him.”</p>
<p>Ning Yue wiped his little green sword. In his mind, he was still
standing in that man’s shadow. Determination flashed through Ning
Yue’s eyes. Then they became calm again. He walked up to the bodies
of the strange woman and Hell King.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>Han Sen maintained his claim on the primary root king dragon to
absorb the king air. He stayed there for a whole month.</p>
<p>The blood kirin also absorbed a lot of king air, and over the
month of training, he healed fully. Over the same period of time,
Han Sen managed to get five hundred Duke genes.</p>
<p>But The Story of Genes could only open three gene locks before
it stopped. As for the rest of the Duke genes Han Sen collected, he
used them to open the gene locks of Jadeskin and the Blood-Pulse
Sutra.</p>
<p>Jadeskin seemed to have the same limit of three gene locks.</p>
<p>“Opening the first gene lock grants an astral body. Opening the
second gene lock provides a celestial body. Opening the third gene
lock provides something above a celestial body. The third body
feels different from a celestial body, but I can’t pinpoint exactly
what that difference is.” Han Sen was amazed by the results of
opening the third gene lock, even if he didn’t fully understand
what had happened.</p>
<p>As he trained, he also earned another reward. He managed to
bring his Dongxuan Sutra up to the level of Duke. It had an
element, but because he didn’t have any more Duke genes, he
couldn’t open up any more gene locks.</p>
<p>After The Story of Genes opened its third gene lock, it became
difficult to absorb the power of the Kingese in his body. It was
like the Kingese had fully merged with Han Sen’s cells, and they
could no longer be separated.</p>
<p>Han Sen still wished to stay in King’s Garden to absorb more
king air, though. He wanted to open three gene locks for the
Blood-Pulse Sutra and the Dongxuan Sutra. His hopes were soon
dashed, however, because Bai Ling Shuang eventually showed up.</p>
<p>“Brother Sixteen, I’m headed back to Night Charm Town,” Bai Ling
Shuang said in a friendly tone.</p>
<p>“I’d like to go there myself, but I haven’t gotten an
invitation.” Han Sen then thought to himself, “There’s no way that
she’s randomly being nice. What does she want this time?”</p>
<p>“I’ll have Cher and the drinks ready. I will be the host
tonight.” Bai Ling Shuang gave him a lazy smile.</p>
<p>“In that case… I’ll be there.” Han Sen’s eyes were full of
greed.</p>
<p>Han Sen didn’t actually want to go, of course. But since Bai
Ling Shuang had extended such an explicit invitation, he didn’t
think he could turn her down. He would have to go eventually, so
agreeing immediately would cast fewer doubts on his identity.</p>
<p>Bai Yi’s ardent desire for Cher was well-known. If he didn’t
accept the invitation, that would be very strange.</p>
<p>In the most luxurious suite in Night Charm Town, Han Sen had
draped himself over a sofa. He held Cher casually under one arm,
and he swirled a glass of wine with his other hand. He looked at
Bai Ling Shuang and said, “Sister Ten, tell me what it is you
really want. You have been very generous with me this evening.
Surely this isn’t simply an opportunity for us to hang out.”</p>
<p>“The exams for the royal children are coming up soon. What are
you planning to do about them, Brother Sixteen?” Bai Ling Shuang
asked with a smile.</p>
<p>Han Sen had a sip of wine and squeezed Cher’s butt with a smile.
“What can I do? I’m just a first-tier King, and half-deified royal
children will be competing. Even some deifieds will participate.
What chance do I stand?”</p>
<p>Bai Ling Shuang looked like she wanted to roll her eyes, but she
still smiled and said, “Maybe not. The exams are something Father
has established so that our progress can be reviewed. We don’t need
to be number one. We just need to perform well to impress Father.
If we do that, we can be rewarded.”</p>
<p>After pausing, Bai Ling Shuang said, “I have witnessed your
recent progress with my own eyes, Brother Sixteen. If you perform
just as well in the exam, Father will notice. You will be heavily
rewarded.”</p>
<p>“I don’t think so,” Han Sen said with an uncomfortable
feeling.</p>
<p>Bai Ling Shuang looked at Han Sen for a while and said, “If you
really don’t want to get first place in the exams, I have a way in
which we can make money. Are you interested in hearing more?”</p>
<p>“I lack pretty much everything. I have a distinct lack of money,
too. Please tell me, Sister Ten.” Han Sen suddenly looked much more
alert, and he considered Bai Ling Shuang with interest.</p>
<p>She smiled and said, “You know that in the exam, there is a task
that sends you to Bone Mountain? Bone Mountain is obscenely
dangerous for ordinary royal children. Aside from Brother Four and
Sister Three, who are deified, any other royal child that goes
there might fail. Even the crown prince. But Brother Sixteen, you
are different. You have the Kingese protection. You can surely
reach the peak of Bone Mountain.”</p>
<p>“Why don’t you just tell me what you’re after?” Han Sen
frowned.</p>
<p>“You help me to get to the peak of Bone Mountain, and I will
give you whatever you want.” Bai Ling Shuang’s smile had vanished,
and she looked dead serious.</p>
