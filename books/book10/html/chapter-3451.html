<p>Human King grabbed Ji Yanran’s hands. Black and grey light was
released. It was like many mysterious spells created a chain that
ensnared Ji Yanran’s body.</p>
<p>Han Ling’er jumped up off the ground. She wanted to attack Human
King again. Before she could do anything, Human King said, “Right
now, her life is connected to mine. If I am hurt, she will suffer
too. If you are not afraid of her dying alongside me, then I dare
you to try and harm her.” “You… obscene…” Han Ling’er was so mad
and angry, but she did not actually do anything.</p>
<p>“Kid, this is an adult world. It is dirtier than you think.”
Human King’s face did not change. He tightened the grasp of his
fingers. It made the trapping spell he had put on Ji Yanran hold
her with greater force. Ji Yanran looked as if she was
suffocating.</p>
<p>“Let go of my mother!” Han Ling’er was furious, but she did not
dare rush forward. She was so small. Her mind was still not mature
enough to fight Human King. Although she had a powerful power, she
could not fight someone like Human King.</p>
<p>Human King ignored her. He turned to Littleflower and said, “I
will count to three. Take back your holy spirit. Otherwise, I will
erase her from existence. Soul and body, it will all be gone.”
“One… Two… Three…” Human King did not stop. He counted to three.
His hands were going to close completely.</p>
<p>“Hang on!” Han Littleflower screamed, but Human King did not
stop. Han Littleflower was so shocked that he put away his Holy
Spirit Protect and madly shouted, “Human King, if you dare to hurt
her, I will kill you!”</p>
<p>Human King’s body finally stopped. He coldly said, “Young Man,
talking crap will only make you look like a useless human being. Do
not say anything that is out of your power to control.”</p>
<p>When the Holy Spirit Protect was taken away by Littleflower, Han
Ling’er’s form, which looked like an angel, receded. She returned
to looking like a child again. Her power was reduced. Now, there
was no hope of her fighting back against Human King. With the
combined powers of the brother and sister, they had managed to
suppress Human King. When their powers split up, neither of them
could fight against him. Han Littleflower was still able to fight
against Human King a little, but his Holy Spirit Protect needed to
be used on someone to maximize the power. Using it alone was not
very strong. It would not pose a big threat to Human King. Seeing
Han Ling’er return to her original self, Human King wanted to kill
her. The universe power generated once more and struck Han Ling’er
fiercely. He wanted to kill Han Ling’er to erase the threat she
posed.</p>
<p>His head was very clear. Killing Han Littleflower would prove
difficult, and Han Littleflower had the Holy Spirit Protect, which
was something that required other people to make it powerful. Holy
Spirit Protect’s power was undeniably strong. If the person being
protected was not strong, the Holy Spirit Protect would not be
strong either.</p>
<p>Han Ling’er’s and Han Littleflower’s Holy Spirit Protect was the
scariest. Only one of them had to be removed.</p>
<p>Now, he had greatly offended Han Sen’s family. It did not matter
if he killed a daughter of the Han family. Compared to the leader
of the universe, killing an heir was practically nothing</p>
<p>Human King practiced with the Blood-Pulse Sutra. He had absorbed
the Blood-Pulse of Blood Legion members from every single
generation. That was how he was able to purify his blood. It was
unknown how many members had been sacrificed to make him the man he
was now. He was not like some soft man who was incapable of making
a decision.</p>
<p>“Ling’er.” Littleflower saw Human King’s murderous visage and
swapped space to block Ling’er from the power. He exploded his holy
spirit power to throw a punch at Human King’s incoming universe
power.</p>
<p>Seeing two powers about to collide, Human King lifted Ji Yanran
in front. This time, Human King was not going to make the same
mistake. He put Ji Yanran in front, but he did not let
Littleflower’s power be allowed to touch Ji Yanran. His power was
going to blow up Ji Yanran’s body.</p>
<p>“If you want her to live, be honest with me,” Human King coldly
said.</p>
<p>Littleflower had to put his power away. Otherwise, his punch
would end up blowing up Ji Yanran’s body before he could even reach
Human King. Littleflower withdrew his power. Human King’s universe
power struck Littleflower and made him fly away.</p>
<p>Although there was the Holy Spirit Protect power going with him,
which meant Littleflower would not be killed, when Littleflower
left, Ling’er was exposed. Human King did not hesitate. He used
that opportunity to generate a finger. He pointed at Han Ling’er’s
forehead with the desire to break her spirit body.</p>
<p>“Ling’er.” Ji Yanran and Han Littleflower felt bad. They wanted
to use their bodies to block the strike that was about to fall on
Han Ling’er.</p>
<p>Ji Yanran could not move. Han Littleflower wanted to teleport
back, but it was too late. Huangfu Jing and Tang Zhenliu were very
angry witnessing this, but they were not even as fast as Han
Littleflower. They would be unable to carry out a rescue.</p>
<p>While everyone was in shock seeing Han Ling’er’s body about to
be punched by Human King’s universe powers, there was suddenly a
flash. A small body appeared in front of Han Ling’er. It came with
gold light. Human King’s universe power went against that brilliant
gold light. It was like wine pouring into a bottle. It simply
vanished. “Bao’er… Sister Bao’er…” When everyone saw this shadow
arrive, they were all just as happy as they were shocked. Han
Ling’er and Han Littleflower were very happy. They all called her
Big Sister.</p>
<p>Bao’er was clutching a little gold gourd. She stared at Human
King. She used her gourd to take away Human King’s universe
power.</p>
<p>Far away in the forest, Chaos stood atop the pinnacle of a tall
tree. She looked down at Bao’er and seemed conflicted.</p>
<p>Bao’er had not succeeded in combining with the super god gene
seed yet, so it was very risky of her to try and battle Human King
now. She did not want this to happen.</p>
<p>But Bao’er went there by her own volition, and she had been
powerless to try and stop her.</p>
<p>With Human King showing up in Space Garden, of all places, she
was a bit confused. She had spent all her time in the sanctuaries,
so she had not learned about Qin Xiu being consumed by Human King.
“How dare you hurt my mother!” Bao’er looked at Human King and
spoke very slowly.</p>
<p>Human King grabbed Ji Yanran and coldly said, “It is good that
you are here. The whole family has been fighting me, so now I will
have the chance to erase you all.”</p>
<p>“You should be the one who dies.” Bao’er rarely got mad, but
now, she was blisteringly furious. She lifted the gourd and aimed
at Human King.</p>
<p>Human King grabbed Ji Yanran and coldly said, “If you want her
to die, then do it.”</p>
<p>Bao’er behaved as if she did not hear anything. She held the
gold gourd with its bottom facing the sky. The gourd faced Human
King. She patted the gourd. It made the little gold gourd shine
with gold. A beam of gold came out of it, firing toward Human King
like a laser.</p>
<p>“Sister Bao’er, don’t do it…” Littleflower and Ling’er were in
shock.</p>
<p>Human King had already learned his lesson from Han Littleflower.
He was not going to allow Littlelflower’s power to touch Ji Yanran.
He put his hand back and pulled Ji Yanran away. The spell that had
bound Ji Yanran became tighter. It was digging into her skin and
looked ready to break her body.</p>
