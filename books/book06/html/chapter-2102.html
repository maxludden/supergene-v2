<p>Han Sen learned a lot from the seventy-two original gene kill
spells.</p>
<p>Suppress Evil was based on the seventy-two original gene kill
spells. Han Sen used his Dongxuan Aura to study the original gene
kill spells, and through this, his proficiency with Suppress Evil
improved rapidly. He reached the eighth tier after just one
year.</p>
<p>His progress was interrupted, however, when the elders gave him
another mission. He was tasked with taking on a Marquise xenogeneic
that was wreaking havoc on a business planet belonging to Sky
Palace. The job was simple, and Han Sen killed the creature
easily.</p>
<p>When he returned to Sky Palace, however, his phone rang. It was
a call from the number that Xi Menxiaong had given him.</p>
<p>Han Sen had called the number before, but no one answered. It
looked like Xi Menxiaong had given him the number so he could call
Han Sen, and not for Han Sen to call him.</p>
<p>Han Sen answered. There was no video, only voice. Han Sen
remained quiet as the person on the other end began to speak.</p>
<p>“Han Sen, it is me.” The voice was familiar, but it didn’t
belong to Xi Menxiaong. It was God’s Retribution.</p>
<p>“God’s Retribution?” Han Sen frowned. Now he was certain that
Blood Legion had a method of leaving the sanctuaries. “Yes. Listen,
I do not have much time. I’m being watched,” God’s Retribution
said.</p>
<p>“How did you leave the sanctuaries?” Han Sen asked. Just hearing
the voice wasn’t enough for him to be sure that it was God’s
Retribution.</p>
<p>“Blood Legion has always had a way to leave. We just can’t
return.” God’s Retribution went on to say, “But now is not the time
for that. Listen, do not let anyone know you have practiced the
Blood-Pulse Sutra. If you do, you may find yourself in
trouble.”</p>
<p>“Why?” Han Sen asked.</p>
<p>“It’s complicated. Some guy in the geno universe is coming after
Blood Legion members. Fortunately, you have not practiced the
Blood-Pulse Sutra enough to have blue blood. Just don’t tell
anyone. If you don’t, you won’t be found out,” God’s Retribution
said.</p>
<p>“Who has a feud with Blood Legion in the geno universe? Which
higher race is it?” Han Sen asked.</p>
<p>“It is not a higher race. It is something far worse.” God’s
Retribution hesitated for a moment, but he still went on to say,
‘You know the creature that called itself a god? The one the
seventh team encountered?”</p>
<p>Han Sen’s heart jumped and he said, “That guy is in the geno
universe?”</p>
<p>“Yes, but he didn’t come here from the sanctuaries like we did.
This universe is his home. Remember, don’t let anyone know that
you’ve practiced the Blood-Pulse Sutra. If you do, you’ll find
yourself a target. And keep up the ruse that you’re a crystallizer.
Don’t mention to anyone that you’re actually a human. That will
expose the fact that you’re from the sanctuaries. You did well to
do that from the start,” God’s Retribution said.</p>
<p>“What is he?” Han Sen asked.</p>
<p>“I don’t know how to explain. All I can say is that he is
scarier than a deified elite, and we cannot hope to fight him. He’s
killed many Blood Legion members. Until recently, we’ve had no hope
of fighting back,” God’s Retribution said.</p>
<p>“What’s different now?” Han Sen asked.</p>
<p>“Super genes,” God’s Retribution said.</p>
<p>“What does that mean?” Those two words caught Han Sen’s
interest.</p>
<p>“Only people who have maxed out their super genes in the
sanctuaries can compete with a creature like him. That is our only
hope. Until you’ve grown stronger, do not expose the fact that you
possess the Blood-Pulse Sutra.” God’s Retribution was speaking
quickly.</p>
<p>“If you knew about all this, why didn’t you tell me back in the
sanctuaries?” Han Sen asked.</p>
<p>God’s Retribution said, “I told you, we can only leave the
sanctuaries. We are unable to return. I only learned about this
from the other members upon arrival. Okay. There’s no time. I’ll
contact you again.”</p>
<p>The conversation was disconnected abruptly. Han Sen put the
phone away and thought to himself, “If all of this is real, then
who is this so-called god? Is he like King Jun? Can he not murder
anyone here?”</p>
<p>Han Sen thought about this for quite a while, but he didn’t come
to any more conclusions. He hadn’t planned on exposing his
Blood-Pulse Sutra anyway, but after that reminder, he would make
doubly sure not to. Whether or not God’s Retribution was telling
the truth, no harm would come from maintaining a low profile.</p>
<p>After thinking things over, Han Sen tried to call him back. Just
like before, it did not work.</p>
<p>“Blood Legion members have been able to enter the geno universe
for a very long time. Maybe Human Emperor is around here somewhere,
but even so, humans have no fame. They must be hiding themselves
away, under great pressure.” Han Sen looked grim as he continued
talking to himself. “Is that god really that powerful, I
wonder?”</p>
<p>After Han Sen reported the results of his quest to Sky Palace,
he was granted some vacation days.</p>
<p>His Dongxuan Sutra and The Story of Genes still hadn’t reached
Marquise yet. The Dongxuan Sutra was slowly growing stronger, but
The Story of Genes had come to a standstill. He wouldn’t level that
up unless he got some help.</p>
<p>Han Sen tried to use the Jade Spirits to boost The Story of
Genes, but it wasn’t very effective. Progress was insufferably
slow. At that rate, it would take several decades to become a
Marquise with The Story of Genes.</p>
<p>As Han Sen ransacked his mind for a solution to the problem,
Thousand Feather Crane arrived with an order from Sky Palace.</p>
<p>The leader has told me to go to the Feather?” Han Sen looked at
Thousand Feather Crane in disbelief.</p>
<p>The Sky Palace leader knew of the grudge that the Feathers had
against Han Sen, given his connection with Kong Fei. There was also
the Blood Feather Knife incident, which only fanned the flames of
their hatred.</p>
<p>Yes. The leader wants you to be Sky Palace’s envoy to the
Feathers. This is good. Have you heard of Holy Heaven’s Pool of
Rebirth? If you go there as an envoy, you can use it,” Thousand
Feather Crane said.</p>
<p>You mean the pool Angia used to erase everything he had learned?
I don’t want to be reborn. What’s the point in that?” Han Sen
frowned.</p>
