<p>Violet tried to shy back from Han Sen, but he had lost all
control of his body. Han Sen continued to approach him with the
placidity of an all-powerful god.</p>
<p>Just as Han Sen was about to reach Violet, the flower on
Violet’s head suddenly flashed with light. Many green sproutlings
surged out of Violet’s scalp and wrapped down around his body like
jade tentacles. The vines formed a green set of armor.</p>
<p>Katcha!</p>
<p>Violet’s body finally moved. The green air around his body was
burning, and he was finally able to unleash his power. His emerald
eyes peered through the vine helmet’s slit. They were looking right
at Han Sen.</p>
<p>“Should I call you Violet or God now?” Han Sen asked, stopping
in his tracks as he carefully examined Violet in his vine
armor.</p>
<p>“My name is Sky Vine Radish,” said Violet from within his
armor.</p>
<p>Although his voice hadn’t changed, his tone and inflection
sounded different. It was just a small change, but it was enough to
make him come across as a different person.</p>
<p>“You really are a god?” Han Sen asked, raising an eyebrow at Sky
Vine Radish.</p>
<p>“I guess,” Sky Vine Radish said dispassionately.</p>
<p>“A god that can satisfy one’s wishes?” Han Sen asked again.</p>
<p>“No.” Sky Vine Radish’s answer surprised Han Sen.</p>
<p>Sky Vine Radish went on to say, “My god body was almost
destroyed in a god battle. I don’t have the power to fulfill your
wishes. Of course, if you guys can help me by making a wish that
isn’t too difficult to fulfill, then I can give it a shot. I could,
for instance, level you up once so you can become a transmutation
deified.”</p>
<p>“You need power to fulfill wishes? In reality, don’t those
wishes only benefit gods like you?” Han Sen sneered at Sky Vine
Radish.</p>
<p>Now, he knew for sure that Sky Vine Radish was just like King
Jun. He was an empty god. But he looked damaged. Otherwise, he
never would have gotten himself into this situation.</p>
<p>Sky Vine Radish’s eyes shone with a green light, and he asked,
“Who are you?”</p>
<p>“I’m the guy who will kill you.” Han Sen suddenly exploded with
his own power. He cast his Dongxuan powers and had them firing on
all cylinders. He threw a punch at Sky Vine Radish. The white
phoenix flames licked hungrily around Han Sen’s hand.</p>
<p>Sky Vine Radish didn’t show any indication that he intended to
step back. Instead, with amazing speed, he reached out his hand and
grabbed Han Sen’s fist. Han Sen gathered up power to attack again,
but it was blocked by his enemy.</p>
<p>“Although I am heavily injured and borrowing a low-level’s body,
pathetic creatures like you can’t hope to compete,” Sky Vine Radish
proclaimed in a cold, distant voice.</p>
<p>But the next second, Sky Vine Radish let go of Han Sen’s fist as
if he had been electrified. He stumbled backward, raising and
clutching the hand he had used to grab Han Sen’s fist. His hand was
burning with a white fire.</p>
<p>“Phoenix flame! Are you a phoenix? No, obviously not…” Sky Vine
Radish looked at Han Sen in shock. His face was wrought with
confusion.</p>
<p>The phoenix flame refused to be extinguished, and it burned
farther and farther across the god’s body. In seconds, the god’s
entire arm was covered in flames.</p>
<p>Han Sen hadn’t expected his phoenix flame to be that powerful.
His full power attack had been blocked by Sky Vine Radish, but his
enemy hadn’t been able to do anything to douse the phoenix fire.
The man could only watch his body smolder and burn.</p>
<p>“Regrettably for you, you aren’t a true phoenix. If you were,
this fight would be quite annoying for my damaged body,” Sky Vine
Radish said to himself as he watched his burning arm. The phoenix
fire was spreading all across his body, turning his form
momentarily white.</p>
<p>It was very strange to see. The phoenix fires were burning
brightly, but after they passed over Sky Vine Radish, only the
green vine armor was burned away. The body that the god had taken
from Violet was left undamaged.</p>
<p>When the phoenix flames disappeared, Violet’s body was left
looking perfect. Not even a single strand of his hair was singed.
The vine armor encasing his body, however, was gone.</p>
<p>The only thing that was missing from Violet’s body was that
flower atop his head. Beneath the ravaging fires of the phoenix,
even that flower had been turned to ash.</p>
<p>Han Sen could feel the presence of Violet’s body change. What
Han Sen now sensed was different from when Violet had been in
control of himself, but it wasn’t the presence of Sky Vine Radish,
either.</p>
<p>Regardless, Violet didn’t have his deified power anymore. Han
Sen could feel his enemy’s power fading and becoming insignificant.
He was no longer even King class.</p>
<p>“Why is the phoenix’s power so strange? It didn’t hurt Violet.
Is that a coincidence, or is that how it works?” Han Sen’s heart
mulled over the conundrum.</p>
<p>Han Sen didn’t have time to think through the matter thoroughly,
though. He ignored the currently unconscious Violet, and instead
looked at the giant, jade god beyond the vines.</p>
<p>Clearly, this was Sky Vine Radish’s actual body, which had been
damaged long ago.</p>
<p>According to what Han Sen knew, gods were unable to directly
harm beings of the universe, and the beings of the universe
couldn’t harm them either. But this god body was clearly some sort
of exception to that rule.</p>
<p>“How about we make a trade?” The giant, jade eyes of the being
were still shut. Its lips didn’t move, but even so, a voice
bellowed through the air and rang in Han Sen’s ears.</p>
<p>“I don’t make deals with gods,” Han Sen said flatly. Then he
threw a punch at the jade giant.</p>
<p>Pang!</p>
<p>Han Sen’s fist struck the jade giant’s eye. It made the sound of
jade stone being broken. Han Sen had used all his power, but the
jade giant’s body didn’t move.</p>
<p>The phoenix flame burned on the jade giant’s skin, but it was
only alight for a brief time before it was extinguished. It didn’t
seem to be capable of burning the creature’s skin.</p>
<p>“If you really were a phoenix, you probably would stand a chance
of harming my god body. But you only have the phoenix’s flames. As
you can see, that doesn’t work on me. Why don’t we just chill for a
minute and talk?” said Sky Vine Radish’s voice again.</p>
<p>Han Sen paid little attention to what the creature was saying,
though. This might be his final chance to defeat a god. Who knew if
he would ever get another opportunity like this one?</p>
<p>Right now, Sky Vine Radish just wanted to talk things over. He
could make himself heard to anyone in the chamber, but he couldn’t
move. His body was badly damaged, and even after all the years his
remains had been here, it had yet to recover.</p>
<p>Han Sen kept on punching Sky Vine Radish’s body, and the god
couldn’t so much as twitch in retaliation. However, the only thing
that Han Sen’s phoenix flame could do was scorch a small part of
its skin.</p>
<p>“I told you. You cannot hurt my body,” Sky Vine Radish said
imperiously.</p>
<p>“That might not be true.” Han Sen retrieved his phoenix feather
from Destiny’s Tower. He gripped it in his hand like a sword, then
slashed across Sky Vine Radish’s body.</p>
<p>Screech!</p>
<p>The white flames formed the shape of a phoenix feather. Han Sen
thrust his weapon halfway into Sky Vine Radish’s body. The
resulting wound showed that Sky Vine Radish’s flesh was green like
jade, and green blood began to leak steadily from the opened
flesh.</p>
