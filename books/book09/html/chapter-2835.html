<p>Han Sen felt terrible. At this time, Very High Leader’s mind has
reached Very High Forget Love level. If he really wants to achieve
Sky and Men Combined Together, does he have to cut off all other
thoughts? Will he kill the butterfly lady?</p>
<p>Although Han Sen knew things were not going well, he had no
other choice. With God there, he couldn’t stop Very High
Leader.</p>
<p>Will I have to become a slave for a century? Han Sen’s brain
quickly spun. He hoped to find a chance.</p>
<p>The butterfly lady saw that Very High Leader was no longer
looking like he was in his right mind. She sadly looked at him and
said, “Are you really going to kill me?”</p>
<p>Very High Leader shook his head. “I have already learned the
secrets of Very High Forget Love. Through the flow of time, favor,
grudges, and love are not enough to leave a mark in my heart. From
now on, there will be no more connection between you and me. We are
just strangers. Go. The sky is big, and the ground is big. You will
always find somewhere else to be in Outer Sky.”</p>
<p>Han Sen was shocked. He thought he had underestimated Very High
Leader. He now understood. He did get the secrets of Very High
Sense, but at a deeper level than Han Sen presumed. He really did
let go of all else. Even the butterfly lady could not keep him
there.</p>
<p>Am I that lucky? Did I just win the bet? Han Sen did not believe
God would let him win the bet that easily. He looked at God.</p>
<p>He saw God was still watching on with interest. It was not going
to stop what was happening. It was like nothing mattered to it, and
it was merely there to watch.</p>
<p>Han Sen tested him by asking, “Are you not going to convince
him?”</p>
<p>“No. Everything is going according to plan. I just hope the
story will not be disappointing.” God was speaking to Han Sen but
kept watching Very High Leader and the butterfly lady. God was like
a young man watching a sad drama and was going to get emotional by
simply watching.</p>
<p>Han Sen saw God was looking like he was not going to do
anything, but he thought he would win. So, he looked at Very High
Leader and the butterfly lady. He tried to find out why God was
feeling so confident.</p>
<p>Very High Leader did not want to kill. He treated the butterfly
lady like a stranger. He said what he had to and got ready to
leave.</p>
<p>Suddenly, the butterfly lady laughed very loudly. That laugh was
very spiking to the eardrums. Han Sen felt itchy by just hearing
her. His skin flared with a bevy of goosebumps.</p>
<p>Seeing the butterfly lady spread her wings, she looked into the
sky and laughed sharply. The substance chains on her were like
countless butterfly shadows. They surrounded her. It was like a
butterfly of death coming at them from the underworld.</p>
<p>“Are you leaving Just like that?” The butterfly lady ceased
smiling. Her eyes had a scary light. She was confronting Very High
Leader.</p>
<p>“You should learn to let go and move on,” Very High Leader
coldly said. His heart did not seem to contain the compassion it
once did. No matter what the butterfly lady did, she could not make
him feel anything.</p>
<p>The butterfly lady pointed at Very High Leader and shouted, “You
said it like it was so easy! Have you spared a moment to think
about me? Those of the Love Butterfly mate for life. If we get
abandoned by our spouse, we have to die alone. If you just dump me
like this, what is the difference between that and killing me?”</p>
<p>Han Sen finally understood why God was feeling so confident.
God’s target from the very beginning was not Very High Leader. It
was the butterfly lady.</p>
<p>Han Sen thought about how things had been developing. The
butterfly lady had been forced to this level. She was a part of
everything that was going on.</p>
<p>My practice really was not enough. I have been tricked by God
ever since the beginning. I never did one-up over God’s plans. Han
Sen knew that he had sorely lost this time.</p>
<p>But the butterfly lady was still alive. There was still a chance
for him to turn the tables. Although it would be difficult, a
chance was a chance.</p>
<p>“Sorry,” Very High Leader coldly said.</p>
<p>His apology made the butterfly lady even more enraged. The
butterfly lady screeched and asked, “If I am dying anyway, why
should I die alone? I should have you die with me. Let’s see how
you will truly leave me.”</p>
<p>The butterfly lady’s face looked crazy. Her butterfly shadow was
like the shadow of a reaper’s scythe headed for Very High
Leader.</p>
<p>The butterfly-class butterfly lady was powerful. Although Very
High Leader had learned Very High Sense’s secrets, his power was
still primitive. He couldn’t fight against the butterfly-class
butterfly lady. It was just a reflection, but Very High Leader’s
body had been dealt with many cuts that were scary to see. They
were given by the butterfly shadow. God blood came out of his
wounds.</p>
<p>“If Very High Leader is murdered, does that mean you lose?” Han
Sen asked God.</p>
<p>“Yes,” God nodded and continued looking at Very High Leader and
butterfly lady fighting with interest.</p>
<p>“Then, aren’t you going to save him?” Han Sen attempted asking.
He wanted to know what God was currently calculating to see Very
High Leader be able to kill the butterfly lady.</p>
<p>“There is no need,” God coldly said. “Life and death should just
be let be. I have done my part. The choices made are now theirs to
create.”</p>
<p>Han Sen couldn’t find out anything. He looked at the
battleground, thinking about how Very High Leader was going to
defeat the butterfly lady.</p>
<p>No matter how he viewed matters, the butterfly lady was
suppressing Very High Leader. He wasn’t standing a chance.</p>
<p>The butterfly lady’s power was very unique. She was not like an
ordinary xenogeneic. Her powers contained death elements and
emotional elements, and her geno arts were also very weird. Even if
Han Sen fought her, he was not sure if he would be able to kill
her.</p>
<p>Very High Leader was only 20 years and had just become
primitive. He couldn’t defeat the butterfly lady. He might have
ended up being killed by the butterfly lady.</p>
<p>Many butterfly shadows riddled Very High Leader’s body with
lesions. Even when using Very High Sense at its best, he was unable
to block the butterfly lady’s power.</p>
<p>Very High Leader tried teleporting. When he teleported, his body
was hit by the butterfly shadow. He dropped out of teleporting.</p>
<p>The butterfly shadows that kept appearing and disappearing were
like the death butterflies everywhere harvesting lives. They were
surrounding Very High Leader, and they kept cutting up his
body.</p>
<p>Pang!</p>
<p>Very High Leader’s body hit a branch of the star tree. God blood
spilled from out of his mouth. The god blood that had been bleeding
dyed his armor red.</p>
<p>He was half-sitting and half-leaning against the star tree. Very
High Leader looked as if he was dying.</p>
<p>“Now, come back to me, and I might still let you live. I can
spare your life.” The butterfly lady was in front of the Very High
Leader. Death butterflies surrounded her. They were creating a
weird butterfly path that led to the underworld. If Very High
Leader said no, it seemed as if Very High Leader would go to that
underworld that no life could enter.</p>
<p>“I have already told you that you and I are mere strangers now,”
Very High Leader said while wiping the blood from his mouth. He
spoke coldly while sitting against the star tree.</p>
<p>“Then, you and I should die together.” The butterfly lady moved
her body. The death butterflies were everywhere. They were going to
the Very High Leader, who could no longer battle.</p>
