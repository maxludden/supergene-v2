  “It is a shame Han Sen did not join the geno god list fights. If he had taken part, they would have been even more exhilarating.”

“It is no wonder why he has chosen to challenge the Buddha. He really is quite strong.”

“I know who Han Sen is. He is God’s daddy. How could he do something that he was not confident with?”

…

Every Buddha looked nervous and strange. In the past, no one would have believed that Han Sen could suppress Burning Lamp, who was in the top 100 of the geno god list. The Buddha had a lot of faith in Burning Lamp, but Han Sen’s knife had suddenly lobbed their pride and confidence into the abyss.

Han Sen’s face did not move. He used his hand like a knife. He used all of the skills from Teeth Knife. The knife air soared through the sky like fangs of a generation beast. It was like it could crush everything.

This had been hyped as a showcase for Burning Lamp’s might. It turned out that Burning Lamp was going to get massacred. He was at a total disadvantage. Burning Lamp could not repel Han Sen’s knife air. He kept dodging. When he could no longer do so, he used his causal karma knife to block Han Sen’s knife air.

The knife air hit the causal karma knife. Burning Lamp and his knife flew away like an asteroid through space. His face turned white. His organs had been rattled quite a bit.

“They are both butterfly class, but Han Sen’s power far exceeds that of Burning Lamp. How did that guy do this?” Extreme King’s fourth uncle complimented him.

Second Uncle Bai Buyi laughed and said, “Han Sen should not celebrate too soon. He is strong, but he is not stronger than the Pluto Peacock. Burning Lamp used the knife to defeat Pluto Peacock. It will be hard for Han Sen to win. He needs to deal with that knife.”

“Han Sen said that knife was the knife blank Burning Lamp stole from him.”

Meng Lie asked with curiosity, “Is that true?”

“Who knows? The Buddha love to take the powers of others for their own use. All the geno arts the Buddha have mostly stemmed from other races. In fact, something like the Return of Origin. Ha-ha… It is hard to tell…” Bai Buyi laughed and stopped talking.

“Now, it depends on whether or not Han Sen can break the knife’s causal power. If he cannot break it, then it does not matter how he tries to suppress Burning Lamp. If that knife power is triggered, Burning Lamp can make a massive comeback from his situation of losing.” Meng Lie looked at Han Sen, whose eyes were on fire.

Han Sen’s knife hit the sky. The teeth air from the Teeth Knife was strong. It suppressed Burning Lamp and made him suffocate. It made it harder for him to block Han Sen’s attack.

Chee!

Burning Lamp’s chest was delivered a knife-borne lesion wherever the knife air went past. Blood came squirting out of it.

Katcha!

In the next moment, Han Sen’s knife pierced Burning Lamp’s left rib bones. It seemed to break his bones.

Han Sen was like a scary demon. He kept slashing on Burning Lamp, whose body had more and more wounds. Those wounds burned with purple fire. They kept tearing Burning Lamp’s wounds and made them hurt more and more.

Before this, no one would have thought that Han Sen would take advantage this much while Burning Lamp was forced to lose so terribly. Burning Lamp could not fight back at all.

The Buddha were all gnashing their teeth. Their hearts grew more nervous.

A Buddha King shouted, “Mister Alpha still has the causal karma knife! Han Sen cannot beat Mister Alpha! As soon as the causal karma knife kicks in, Han Sen will lose!”

Another Buddha King joined in. “Not bad. Even Pluto Peacock could not block the causal karma knife. Han Sen won’t be able to do anything.”

Sky Palace Leader heard what the Buddha were saying and shook his head. “The Buddha are putting all their hopes and dreams on one little treasure. Even if they managed to get rid of Han Sen, it is unlikely they can remain a higher race for much longer. Burning Lamp is old.”

Yisha looked at Han Sen and did not speak. Han Sen’s Teeth Knife was not much weaker than hers, but his was a pure Teeth Knife. It was not like Yisha’s Teeth Knife, which had combined with something. It just had a ripping element.

Even Yisha was not sure if she could just use Teeth Knife in a battle with Han Sen.

“Time goes by fast,” Yisha said with a sigh. “Without even noticing it, he has grown up so much. Back then, I never thought he would become deified.”

Sky Palace Leader laughed and said, “It is not just you. Back then, Kong Fei gave him a deified feather. Many elites of the races did not spare him a second look. No one wanted to recruit him or thought he could become deified. Fortunately, you were smart. You recruited him, and you raised him. Now, Han Sen has achieved so much. I am afraid all the others are regretting it now.”

A wry smile appeared on Yisha’s face. She did not accept Han Sen because of his power. It was because she was making a bet with an old fortune-teller. She felt ashamed to receive such compliments from Sky Palace Leader.

Yisha was still very happy that Han Sen had achieved the lot he had. She had provided him a lot, so it was good to see that it had not been in vain. He had exceeded her wildest expectations.

“How far can he go?” Yisha wanted to know what Han Sen’s limit was. She was excited to see.

Buddha blood fell. The knife air was like flames. With Han Sen’s Teeth Knife, Burning Lamp was heavily injured. Yet he still looked at his nemesis with eyes on fire. He was not afraid and did not panic.

Burning Lamp knew he had plenty of trump cards. He still had a chance of winning.

Katcha!

Han Sen slashed Burning Lamp’s legs. He almost cut his legs off. Burning Lamp endured the pain. His eyes became brighter.

“Come on! Hit me more. Make me hurt more. Every injury I sustain will be a poison reverted to you.” Burning Lamp was bleeding, but his faith in victory remained.

“If this keeps going, Han Sen is not going to win,” Li Keer, who was in the Very High, said.

Exquisite looked worried. “The causal karma knife can absorb power and use it. Unless Han Sen can kill Burning Lamp with one hit, when he slashes on Burning Lamp next, Burning Lamp will have the strongest weapon to fight back with. When all that reserved power is unleashed, there is no way Han Sen can block it.”

At this time, Burning Lamp felt his body reach its max. He could not endure any more knife wounds. He suddenly roared like a male lion waking up. Buddha Light exploded. The causal karma knife’s Buddha Light exploded. Scary power was unleashed from the knife.

In the next second, Burning Lamp’s wounds turned into water. It all came out to feed the causal karma knife. It merged with the knife. Burning Lamp’s body was weird as it returned to normal. He no longer had any wounds.
