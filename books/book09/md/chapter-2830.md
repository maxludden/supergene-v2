Very High Leader saw Han Sen and God, frowned, and asked, "Who are you people? How dare you come to the star tree."

If this was a normal race, if an important place was suddenly invaded, they would not have spoken like this. They would have attacked before doing anything.

Very High people were different. They were not in a rush to strike.

God looked at Very High Leader and coldly said, "It does not matter who we are. What is most important is that you betrayed Very High Forget Love's Big Love Path. You have drowned in a little love and little relationship. Is this really what you want?"

Han Sen thought God would use a harsher method. He did not expect God was just going to try and convince the Very High Leader.

Although it was quite difficult to convince the Very High Leader to slay the woman who he had fallen in love with, it should have been something impossible. But Han Sen did not drop his guard because of that.

Han Sen tried to fight back by saying, "Big love and little love are all love. If you cannot do small love, how can you have big love?"

"What does it have to do with you guys?" Very High Leader looked at Han Sen and God with shock. He did not know where these two people had come from and suddenly run up to him to talk about love.

"Of course, it is related." God pointed at Very High Leader as he spoke. "You are part of the Very High. Your responsibilities involve learning about the path of the universe. You are here to maintain the balance of the universe. If you are drowned in small love and a small relationship, who can do the things you should be destined to do?"

When Han Sen heard him, he thought God was being ridiculous in what he was saying. Although the Very High had Sky and Men Combined, it was not at a level that God had mentioned. God's words made it sound like the Very High were superheroes there to maintain world peace. It was like without them, the universe was going to stop spinning.

"I can plan my own plan," Very High Leader glumly said. "There is no need for you guys to tell me what to do."

Han Sen felt as if this was not a good sign. With the Very High people's personalities, unless something touched the deepest core of their hearts, they would not be showing expressions the way he currently was.

Although Very High Leader was very young right now, and his practice was not very strong, he still should not have been so emotionless.

"I am not here to tell you off," God coldly said. "I am here to ask you if you want the Sky and Men Combined Together's big love or small love and small relationships between men and women."

"These two do not contradict each other," Han Sen said. "You can have both."

Very High Leader's face was pale as he asked, "Who are you people? If you do not speak clearly, I am going to be rude to you guys."

Upon hearing all of this, the butterfly lady was angry. She coldly shouted, "You can tell that they are both no good for anybody! Allow me to take them down and ask them!"

After that, the butterfly lady waved her hand. Many substance chains flashed like a halo. They were headed toward Han Sen and God.

Han Sen teleported and dodged them. God did not avoid them. It allowed the halo to tie it up. It did not struggle. After the ring was pulled, God fell to the ground with it.

God fell to the ground but still looked cold. It did not look at the butterfly lady. God instead looked at the Very High Leader and said, "With Sky and Men Combined Together, the Very High will be free. Are you really going to give this up on behalf of the butterfly lady?"

"Hmph! What do you know about Sky and Men Combined Together and the Very High's freedom?" Very High Leader's face looked a bit disdainful.

"Very High Supremacy and Extremely Quiet Pathâ€¦ Without me, without..." God was vaguely talking about some deep skills. Han Sen thought those sentences could be related to Very High Sense. Even so, he did not actually understand what any of it meant. After all, he had not practiced Very High Sense.

"You... How do you know all this?" Very High Leader looked at God with a look that screamed disbelief.

"I know more than just that," God said with a smile. "I know the extreme levels of Sky and Men Combined Together. If you want, I can tell you."

Very High Leader looked at God and asked, "Do you really know Sky and Men Combined Together at an extreme level?" He was half-confused and half-untrusting.

Han Sen thought things were going terrible for him, but he could not think of a way to stop God. It did not matter how much of a rush he was in. He could not just go blocking Very High Leader's eyes and ears and tell him not to listen or look.

Han Sen's brain was spinning fast. He was thinking about what God was trying to do and how to stop God's conspiracy. God only spoke a few sentences about Sky and Men Combined Together at an extreme level, and he had already made Very High Leader overwhelmed and obsessed. When God spoke about the most important aspect, it stopped.

Very High leader was into it so much, but now God had suddenly stopped. He quickly asked, "Why have you stopped talking?"

"I am talking about the universe's greater path, and you are just drowning in small relationships and small love. My path does not suit you." God shook its head as it spoke.

Han Sen now understood what God was trying to do, but he did not think God's method was going to work. His heart flashed with countless possibilities. He was thinking about how best to react to this. He did not speak. He was still waiting to see how this played out.

"How do you know if this will not suit me if we do not try?" Very High Leader looked a bit mad as he spoke.

"If you are really looking for the path, it is easily found." God looked at the butterfly lady and said, "Kill her. Kill her, and I will teach you the extreme levels of Sky and Men Combined Together."

The butterfly lady was enraged. She used a halo to tighten God's body. No matter how much it tightened, it could not harm God's body.

Han Sen noticed that Very High Leader remained silent. He did not think this was good. Oh, no! The personality of the Very High is not normal. They practiced Very High Sense, so the way they think is different from ordinary creatures. It looks like Very High Leader really wanted God's Sky and Men Combined Together's teaching at an extreme level. Maybe he really will kill butterfly lady.

Han Sen knew it was now impossible to convince the Very High Leader. When he made his mind up, there was no point in Han Sen saying anything.

Han Sen did not go and convince Very High Leader. He turned to God and asked, "Do you really know Sky and Men Combined Together at an extreme level?" He knew only beating God would suggest to Very High Leader that he should not be swayed by the intruder.

"Of course, I never lie," God solemnly said.

"I do not believe you. You are not one of the Very High, so how could you know Very High's Sky and Men Combined Together? You should show us right now. Otherwise, I do not believe you, and he will not believe you either." Han Sen had to stall God and make sure the Very High Leader did not make a decision just yet.

"These two guys are very evil. I will kill them." The butterfly lady was very mad at Han Sen and God about the things they had been saying. She wanted to fight again.

"There is no rush. Let's have a look first." Very High Leader pulled the butterfly lady back. This shocked the butterfly lady.

"Are you going to do what they say? Would you kill me to get the Sky and Men Combined Together at an extreme level?" The butterfly lady looked at the Very High Leader madly as she spoke.

"Of course not," Very High Leader immediately said. "I just want to find out if this person knows about Sky and Men Combined Together at an extreme level. After it is performed, I will kill them."
