God-like found that his Eternal Shield seemed to be sealed out of his control now, and he couldn’t infuse it with his power anymore.

Han Sen looked at the shield that had turned into jade, the shield that had once been called invincible. He punched it, and the Eternal Shield was smashed with one strike.

The fragments flew into the sky like ice cubes, and everyone stared blankly at the wreckage. God-like couldn’t believe what he was seeing.

“Now you can leave.” Han Sen lowered his fist. He was satisfied with the performance of his Crystal Core.

Even though it was only at gemstone level, the Crystal Core could suppress the power of a super geno core. It was indeed mighty, and it deserved its ability to top the geno core leaderboard.

“Let’s go.” God-like took a look at Han Sen, and then he gathered the creatures from Sacred shelter and left.

“Han Sen, thank you so much for helping our shelter,” Lotus said gratefully after entering Night Shelter.

“It’s nothing, don’t worry about it. Besides, I don’t get along with Sacred shelter anyway.” Han Sen smiled.

Night Empress and Lotus Empress gave Han Sen a warm welcome. Han Sen didn’t have anything to do, so he stayed in Night Shelter for a couple of days.

Night Empress was influential in the local area, and she was already at emperor level. However, she didn’t have a strong foundation, so she didn’t have many great beings as subordinates. She only had one king spirit and one super creature under her control.

Lotus Empress only had a gemstone geno core, and she wasn’t at emperor level yet.

“I forgot how nice it is to live in such a large shelter,” Han Sen said in praise as he walked with Lotus Empress.

“You can live here as long as you want. I’m here, so this your home as well.” Lotus smiled.

“Then I’ll come here as often as possible,” said Han Sen.

“That’s what I want.” Lotus Empress sat on a rock beside the spring. She put her white feet into the spring water and shook them. She then exclaimed, “I knew that you would accomplish something great, but I didn’t expect you to achieve such great things in the Fourth Sanctuary in such a short period of time. When I heard about Skysword, I couldn’t even believe it was you.”

“You’re being too nice, sister.” Han Sen smiled.

Lotus Empress shook her head. “I’m not being polite. I’m really amazed, and I’m really grateful as well. Without you, my mother would have to take risks in a place like God’s Ruin. Though she’s already an empress, and she’s a top-tier being in the Fourth Sanctuary, I can’t say for sure whether she’d be safe in a place like God’s Ruin. Fortunately, you were there to save her.”

Han Sen sat down beside Lotus Empress, and he completely agreed with what Lotus Empress said. He had been to God’s Ruin before, and he knew how terrifying that place was. The headless rockman and the creature in black armor were both very powerful. Even now, Han Sen couldn’t guarantee that he could defeat them.

“It’s so good to have you here.” Lotus Empress reached out her hands and ruffled Han Sen’s hair.

Han Sen would have resisted if anyone else had done this, but Lotus Empress felt like a sister to Han Sen, so he didn’t feel wrong about it.

“If you have time, sister, you should come and visit my shelter. Though it is not as large as Night Shelter, I still believe that you will like that place,” said Han Sen.

“I will definitely come in a while. However, I am still at the crucial moment before becoming an empress, so I cannot leave Night Shelter yet,” said Lotus.

Han Sen and Lotus talked about things that had happened in the past, and the experience Lotus had after she came to the Fourth God’s Sanctuary.

Han Sen thought that Lotus was very lucky, but she had still gone through many dangers, and she almost lost her life several times before she found a safe place in the Fourth Sanctuary.

She only ran into Night Empress in the second year after she entered the Fourth Sanctuary.

“I can’t believe that you became so powerful without anyone there to help you. How did you do it?” Lotus Empress could not help exclaiming.

After living in Night Shelter for several days, Han Sen scheduled a time to meet Lotus Empress again, then he left Night Shelter and went back to the Underworld.

The time for the real Divinity’s Bout was drawing near, so Han Sen needed to prepare for that as well.

Unlike battles in the geno core storage, the Divinity’s Bout used all the skills, including but not limited to geno cores, beast souls, and learned abilities could be used. Power was all that mattered there.

Han Sen was practicing the Dongxuan Sutra, but unfortunately, he still hadn’t been able to raise Bulwark Umbrella to super level when the Divinity’s Bout actually happened.

“Let’s see who I am going to face in the first fight.” Han Sen scanned over the contestant list. Anyone who showed up in Divinity’s Bout had to be the number one in their own shelter, so Han Sen would not underestimate any of his competitors.

Soon, Han Sen saw the name “Dollar” listed among the competitors. When he looked at his scheduled adversary, he was startled.

He saw the name “Six Paths” opposite his own name. His first adversary was the renowned Emperor Six Paths, the mad man who had excellent sword skills.

Han Sen felt a bit of a headache. Though there were no weak contestants in Divinity’s Bout, running into Six Paths in the first fight was still incredibly unlucky.

There would always be small shelters joining in the contest, so there should be many sacred-blood creatures and king spirits in the first round. Running into Six Paths was like winning the universe’s most terrible lottery.

“I must have stayed with Cheap Sheep and Wang Yuhang for too long.” Han Sen could not believe that he had gotten so unlucky.

Han Sen wasn’t the only person surprised by the matchup. All the great beings in the Fourth God’s Sanctuary were studying the competition list. When they saw the names Dollar and Six Paths put together, they all missed a heartbeat.

“No way. Six Paths and Dollar are fighting in the first round. Something great is going to happen.”

“Who do you think will win?”

“Is that even a question? Six Paths, of course. Six Paths is a top-tier being, and he won the second place last time he joined Divinity’s Bout Though Dollar is also very powerful, he’s still not as powerful as Six Paths.”

“That’s right. But it’s a good thing for us no matter who wins. One of the two will be eliminated, so a powerful competitor will be gone.”

“I’m so looking forward to their competition. I really want to see how powerful that Dollar is. The fight when he suppressed Destroyer Wolf was so quick that I couldn’t even tell his true power.”
