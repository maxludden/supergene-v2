<p>Han Sen was shocked and quickly said, “Please, explain this to
me.”</p>
<p>Han Sen had learned some Xuan Men geno arts. He had learned
quite a bit about Xuan, but he was not very good at it. He was not
as good as Mister White.</p>
<p>If Han Sen was a general who had killed many on the battlefield
and had never lost a single battle or skirmish, Mister White would
have been the grandmaster who could predict the weather and future.
He would have been the one who knew everything.</p>
<p>It was not like one of them was better than the other. It was
just that their directions in learning had differed and gone in
different directions.</p>
<p>Mister White looked at the 33 skies, which looked like a
headstone. He told Han Sen, “After the 33 skies returned to origin,
I was able to calculate that it is a place where Yin and Yang
crossed each other. But the place is not correct. It has a big
murder aura. There is an 80% to 90% chance that creatures that
enter the 33 skies will experience bad stuff.”</p>
<p>When Han Sen heard him, he sighed. “Are you talking about the 33
skies? I was not planning on going there.”</p>
<p>Mister White shook his head. “I can sense a murder aura around
your body. It cooperates with the 33 skies. Even if you do not want
to go there, you will find yourself going there some time.”</p>
<p>“Are you saying that I must go to the 33 skies?” If Han Sen were
young, he would not have believed him. If he did not want to go, no
one would have been able to persuade him to go to the 33 skies.</p>
<p>Han Sen had now experienced too much. He knew there were some
things even invincible elites were compelled to do. He was also not
in a position that was invincible.</p>
<p>Mister White nodded. “You must go. This will be very difficult.
You should be prepared.”</p>
<p>“What about the end of this trip?” Han Sen asked after a brief
think.</p>
<p>Mister White smiled. “The future is the future. The Xuan we
study is only done via calculations with the information we
currently possess. It cannot genuinely predict the future unless
the real meaning of a god exists, of course. No average creature
can actually see into the future. I am, at the end of the day, just
a commoner. I will never be able to know the future, which has many
branching paths, twists, and turns. Little Sen, I worry that you
have overestimated my abilities.”</p>
<p>When Han Sen heard Mister White say that, he knew his trip was
going to be a bad one. Mister White was telling him that there were
many different outcomes. Before the end came, there was still a
chance for him.</p>
<p>Han Sen was thinking about what he would have to do in the 33
skies. He was not thinking about the possibility that he might come
back.</p>
<p>For now, Han Sen had not found a reason to go to the 33 skies
yet.</p>
<p>He spoke to Mister White for a while longer and left. If he
ended up having to go to the 33 skies, he knew he would be better
off being as prepared as he possibly could. Perhaps that way there
would be a much higher chance of him surviving.</p>
<p>Han Sen wanted to gather all the Break World genes he could
before visiting the 33 skies. He thought it might be useful once he
was done.</p>
<p>Upon seeing Han Sen return, Ji Yanran immediately asked, “What
did Mister White say?”</p>
<p>She was still feeling nervous. She had never felt like this
before. Even when Han Sen had been pulled into the anti-material
world by World King God and others thought Han Sen died, Ji Yanran
still remained calm. She had never been this unnerved before.</p>
<p>“Mister White calculated it for me. He said that I will suffer
something disastrous. There is an 80% to 90% chance that I will
bleed.” Han Sen told her half the truth and half a lie.</p>
<p>“What disaster?” Ji Yanran was worried.</p>
<p>“Mister White is not a god. He cannot predict everything. Even
if he could, my chances of dying are at 90%. There is a 10% chance
that I will live. There will be a danger, but I will also be
supported. I will not have to die.” Han Sen sounded very serious as
he spoke about all of this.</p>
<p>Ji Yanran always got scared following Han Sen. Otherwise, Ji
Yanran would not have been interested in learning more about Xuan.
Han Sen would not let Ji Yanran feel scared again.</p>
<p>This half-truth and half-lie made Ji Yanran feel much better. If
Han Sen said he was fine, then Ji Yanran was willing to believe it.
Han Sen had still mentioned he would suffer a disaster despite
living. Even so, she felt much safer.</p>
<p>“You take good care of Ling’er and Littleflower. I am going to
Sky Palace to collect some Break World genes.” Han Sen spoke to her
gently. As usual, he did not say anything more than he needed
to.</p>
<p>Otherwise, with Ji Yanran’s senses, she would have seen
something more.</p>
<p>Han Sen was getting ready to leave when he saw Ling’er. Ling’er
blinked as she asked, “Dad? When you come back, can you bring me a
cat? I want a pet.”</p>
<p>“Why would you suddenly want a cat?” Han Sen looked at
Ling’er.</p>
<p>“The show with the cat and the mouse,” Ling’er said. “That cat
is so funny. I really want one!”</p>
<p>“Sure. When I come home, I will bring you one.” Han Sen agreed
but thought, “I do have a cat, but it is currently with Bao’er. She
is still in the universe of kingdoms. I cannot go to the universe
of kingdoms yet. I must go through the 33 skies to do that.”</p>
<p>When he waved his hands, Han Sen seriously looked at Ji Yanran
and Ling’er, the mother and daughter, and thought, “No matter what,
I will make it back.”</p>
<p>He used Galaxy Teleportation to leave. Han Sen did not go to Sky
Palace. He went to see Littleflower.</p>
<p>The wife and daughter needed to be taken care of. They could not
be allowed to feel worried, but a son was different. If something
happened to Han Sen, he needed someone else to take care of
things.</p>
<p>He had no choice in the matter because he was a man. He was the
leader of the family. He needed to accept responsibility.</p>
<p>“Dad, let me go to the 33 skies with you,” Littleflower
seriously said to Han Sen.</p>
<p>“Do not look down on your father. We do not know the future. I
will cleave my own way through. You just need to look after your
mother and your sister. Also, Meng’er, Zero, Little Angel, and all
the others. They are poor people without any true family of their
own. You need to take care of them.” Han Sen smiled.</p>
<p>“Those sisters have treated me well, and I have always treated
them like real sisters,” Littleflower said.</p>
<p>“In that case, I am leaving.” Han Sen waved his hands and
started going to Sky Palace.</p>
<p>Littleflower suddenly said, “Dad, you have to be careful. I
still want to fight you. I have never asked for anything, but you
must promise me that.”</p>
<p>“Sure. Wait for me here.” Han Sen did not say much. He used
Galaxy Teleportation to reach Sky Palace.</p>
<p>From the outside, Sky Palace exhibited no changes. On the
inside, the sky and ground had been flipped. Countless floating
islands were shrouded in mist. The Break World beasts were hiding
within it.</p>
<p>In that space, the 12 white jade buildings and five jade cities
were floating on the clouds. It was like a depiction of heaven in
some mythical storybook.</p>
