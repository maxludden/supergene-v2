Han Sen was horrified. He wasn’t worried about his own safety. This was the Alliance, so even if he ran into the Chairman of the New Community, Han Sen could defend himself with his unicorn beetle and crystal armor.

However, the fact that the Chairman of the New Community was here meant that something tragic had happened to his father, so naturally, Han Sen was terrified.

“Little Sen, you’ve really grown up,” the Chairman exclaimed, looking at Han Sen.

Han Sen heard the Chairman’s voice, and his eyes almost popped out. He couldn’t believe his ears. He had heard that voice so many times when he was only a child, and he felt that it had been a very long time, and everything was so blurry. When he heard it again, everything kept flooding in, and it was like he just heard it yesterday.

“Impossible…” Han Sen couldn’t believe that he was staring at the Chairman of the New Community.

A strange light emanated from the Chairman’s body, drifting over his skin. He had a full head of white hair, and his face was stripped away by the light. A new face showed up.

The face was that of a gentle, middle-aged man. It overlapped and merged with the face from Han Sen’s memories.

“You…” Han Sen felt like he was suffocating, so he didn’t know what to say at the moment.

“Sit down first, Little Sen. Let’s talk.” Han Yufei sat back on the stone bench, and he pointed at the spot beside him.

“Are you really him?” Han Sen clenched his jaw and sat down beside Han Yufei. He wasn’t sure whether this person was really his father or not.

It was so easy for someone with special power to change their face, so Han Sen couldn’t believe it.

“There’s a little red mole at the left side of your penis. When you were five, you said you liked an older girl in the neighborhood, and you swore that you would be her husband. You were still a bed-wetter when you were six. You were afraid that your mom would find out, so you came to me and begged me to wash your bedsheet for you…” Han Yufei said to Han Sen slowly, smiling.

“Stop! Stop!” Han Sen started to yell. “I believe that you’re my father now… Say no more…”

Han Yufei stopped now, and he looked at Han Sen.

“Are you the Chairman of the New Community?” asked Han Sen, looking at Han Yufei.

“Yes.” Han Yufei nodded.

Han Sen looked at Han Yufei, his expression bizarre. “Since you are the Chairman, why would you send someone to kill me, and why did you tell Blind Man to alert me? Why did you say that you’re in grave danger now?”

Han Sen was very confused. He couldn’t figure it all out.

“It’s a very long story. Simply put, I thought that the New Community was related to our family, so I joined it. Little did I expect that I would inherit the position of Chairman. Eventually I found out that the New Community isn’t related to our family, but it is closely related to an organization called ‘God.’ The relationship between these two is very delicate. The New Community is kind of a subsidiary of the organization God, but God doesn’t have the power to control the New Community completely. The old Chairman told me that he was also a member of the organization called God.”

Han Yufei then continued, “After I became the Chairman, the New Community was still under the influence of God. From everything I have seen, I have a sense of how powerful and terrifying the organization God really is. Besides, God has also focused on Han Jingzhi and our family, and they even told the New Community to kill you.”

Han Sen listened carefully as Han Yufei explained everything.

“Qing Ya was also a member of the organization God, and he was a spy, or an inspector in the New Community. Aside from him, there are others from the God organization in the New Community, but even I don’t know how many there are.” Han Yufei smiled and said. “As for sending people after you, I wanted you to help me get rid of some of the trouble in the New Community, and at the same time, I could also send you some aid. However, there were two things that I hadn’t expected. The first thing was that Tina stole the geno armor and sent it to you. I’ve already figured that out, and I know now that it was Qing Ya who was messing with the whole thing. Fortunately, Tina couldn’t control the geno armor and you were able to seize it, so nothing major happened.”

“As for telling the Blind Man to warn you, I wanted you to be fully prepared so that you could develop strategies to deal with Sha Lanjia and the others. Little did I expect that you were strong enough to kill them directly,” said Han Yufei. He looked at Han Sen and exclaimed. “I’ve been following your progress, but you’ve grown and improved much faster than I thought. I have to say that you’ve done a d*mn good job.”

“Is Tina your daughter?” Han Sen had lots of other urgent questions to ask, but this was the first question that came out of his mouth.

“What are you even thinking?” Han Yufei hit Han Sen’s head gently. “Tina is the daughter of the previous president. After I became the president, I’ve been treating her like my own daughter. Fortunately nothing happened to you two, because otherwise it would be heartbreaking.”

Han Sen felt relieved. He had been worried that if Han Yufei actually had a daughter outside the family, his mother would never allow the family to return to normal again.

After solving that question, Han Sen could think straight again. He looked at Han Yufei and asked, “Dad, what kind of organization is God?”

Han Yufei looked at the lake and said, “This is just speculation, but if I’m right, the core members of the God organization are likely to be creatures from the Fifth God’s Sanctuary.”

Han Sen was startled. “Creatures from the Fifth Sanctuary? And they’re in the Alliance?”

Although he had known that the ancestors of both the human race and the shura race were from the shelter, it was startling that all the creatures in the Fifth God’s Sanctuary could also travel to the Alliance.

Even the weakest creatures in the Fifth Sanctuary were much stronger than demigods. If they were all in the Alliance, humans wouldn’t stand a chance.

However, humans and the shura race were still the dominating forces of this universe.

“What do you think the Fifth God’s Sanctuary is?” asked Han Yufei.

Han Sen was kind of dazed. He didn’t expect Han Yufei to ask him such a question out of nowhere. He thought about it and said, “I’ve been thinking that it might be the place the seventh action team went to.”

Han Yufei shook his head. “I can tell you with absolute certainty that they weren’t in the Fifth God’s Sanctuary.”

“Why?” asked Han Sen.

Han Yufei smiled and said to Han Sen, “Because I’m in the Fifth Sanctuary now, so I certainly know that they weren’t.”

Han Sen opened his mouth wide, and he stared at Han Yufei in awe.
