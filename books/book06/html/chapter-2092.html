<p>In the base, Han Sen was led to two puddles of black water. It
was the same manner of death that the others had died. When Han Sen
scanned the area, he could only detect traces of the Taurus and
Kahn. There were also some Night Ghost substances, but there was
nothing beyond that.</p>
<p>After checking all the cameras, they could not locate the
murderer. Those two Taurus officers had died in their rooms.</p>
<p>From the security feeds, no one else had been seen entering the
rooms. And the locked doors showed no signs of forced entry, until
they were broken down when rescuers had entered to search for the
missing Taurus. There were no other creatures around. Nothing else
had shown up.</p>
<p>Just as with the other victims, there were no clues to be
found.</p>
<p>Han Sen was not a detective, and he planned on letting Lone
Bamboo be the one to handle this matter. Before Han Sen took his
leave, he turned back to Kahn.</p>
<p>“Marquise Kahn, may I ask why you are here?”</p>
<p>Kahn’s expression did not change, and he calmly said, “Because
the Night Ghosts ordered something quite expensive. Because of
that, I delivered the goods myself. I didn’t expect things like
this would transpire after my arrival.”</p>
<p>“May I know what these expensive goods are?” Han Sen asked.</p>
<p>“I am sorry, but we are committed to the privacy of our
customers. If you would like to know what the items are, you will
have to speak with Sleepless Duke,” Kahn said.</p>
<p>Han Sen nodded, and he readied himself to leave. After walking
two steps, he stepped back. “Have those products been
delivered?”</p>
<p>“Yes,” Kahn affirmed.</p>
<p>“Thanks.” Han Sen then left the Taurus base.</p>
<p>“Are you famous?” Li Duo asked Han Sen as they walked back.</p>
<p>Kahn knew who Han Sen was, and he had been quite polite to him.
It surprised her. The only other person who received such deference
from Kahn was Sleepless Duke herself, from what Li Duo could
recall.</p>
<p>But when Li Duo thought about the way Kahn had treated Han Sen,
it was more like Kahn was simply wary of him.</p>
<p>“Not really. It’s just because I killed a Demon that they focus
on me. They kind of hate me.” Han Sen laughed.</p>
<p>“I see.” Li Duo was surprised.</p>
<p>Han Sen looked at Li Duo and randomly said, “It looks like
you’re close with Kahn.”</p>
<p>Li Duo blushed. “Not very close. He and my mother conduct trade
negotiations in Night Ring 12th Street, and he has beaten a few of
our strongest warriors in an event. It’s how I recognize him.”</p>
<p>“What did your mother buy that required a Marquise Demon to
deliver it?” Han Sen asked.</p>
<p>“I don’t know.” Li Duo shook her head.</p>
<p>Han Sen asked a few other questions, then returned to the Duke
manor with Bao’er to look for Lone Bamboo. When Han Sen tracked
down Lone Bamboo’s room, he found the man taking a nap.</p>
<p>“What did you find?” Han Sen asked.</p>
<p>“There is a problem with Sleepless Duke,” Lone Bamboo said with
certainty, opening his eyes.</p>
<p>“What problem?” Han Sen quickly asked.</p>
<p>“I do not know, but I can tell she is hiding something. With my
power, I can’t uncover whatever she is refusing to reveal,” Lone
Bamboo said coldly.</p>
<p>Han Sen told Lone Bamboo what he had found, and Lone Bamboo
sighed. “As far as I can tell, Night Ghosts need sustenance to
survive. But they only eat fresh food. They don’t eat anything that
has been dead for more than a day. The Taurus bring them living
stock. Because of the Sky Palace ruling, the living creatures need
to be killed before reaching Night Ring 12th Street. Nothing alive
can go there.”</p>
<p>“Why does that matter?” Han Sen said.</p>
<p>“Night Ghost is a disturbing race that dines on flesh, but as
for why they must eat goods that are alive… It’s not as simple as
filling their stomachs. They don’t just eat meat. They consume
something we don’t quite understand. The best comparison we can
make is that they eat the souls of their prey.”</p>
<p>“Souls?” Han Sen was surprised. So far, no one had proved souls
actually existed.</p>
<p>“It’s just a description. When Night Ghosts eat, they can absorb
a mysterious substance. It boosts their levels, and especially the
strength of their wills. There was a Night Ghost Duke that had a
will that was stronger than a King class,” Lone Bamboo sad.</p>
<p>Han Sen was surprised, and he said, “Even better than a King
class? Was it deified or half-deified?”</p>
<p>“It should have been a half-deified.” Lone Bamboo continued to
say, “But evolving that way is like cheating. Their minds grow
confused, and their own souls might merge with the consumed
creature’s. They go crazy and become filled with bloodlust. They
can even kill their own families. So, Sky Palace forbids them from
eating creatures that are alive.”</p>
<p>You think Kahn gave something alive to Sleepless Duke?” Han Sen
now understood his line of thinking.</p>
<p>Lone Bamboo nodded and said, “It’s just a guess. Sky Palace
keeps a keen eye on things here, though. They check all creatures
that are ferried to Night Ring 12th Street. Things have run
smoothly for years, but maybe the guard slipped up, and now someone
is taking advantage of things. Like you said, Kahn’s presence seems
suspicious. What item delivery might require the supervision of a
Demon?”</p>
<p>“This is all possible, but why would the Demon agree to this? Do
you think this is all connected to the murders on Planet Night
Ghost?” Han Sen asked quietly.</p>
<p>“I’m not sure, but we will have to ask her,” Lone Bamboo said
coldly.</p>
<p>“Will she admit to this?” Even if she was involved, Han Sen
didn’t think it was likely that she’d just volunteer that
information.</p>
<p>“She has no choice,” Lone Bamboo replied calmly.</p>
<p>Han Sen slumped his shoulders. He wasn’t good at this sort of
thing, so he was just going to follow Lone Bamboo’s lead.</p>
<p>Lone Bamboo wanted to find her right away, but the people of
Duke manor told him she was out. It took another two hours before
they had the chance to see her again.</p>
