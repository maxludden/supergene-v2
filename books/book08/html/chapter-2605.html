<p>The meeting ended quickly. The story of Han Sen making a
butterfly in the palms of his hands spread across all of Sky
Palace. The Sky Palace students were delighted by the result.</p>
<p>When they were alone, Bixi and Exquisite discussed what had
happened. Bixi frowned and asked her, “You want to make Han Sen
your silkworm?”</p>
<p>Exquisite nodded and said, “If Lone Bamboo isn’t willing to join
the Very High, there is no point in forcing him to. I should use
this opportunity to take Han Sen with me.”</p>
<p>Bixi frowned even more. “Have you thought this through? Han Sen
looks very talented, but I don’t think things are as simple as they
seem with him. Perhaps he has practiced a special and unique geno
art that allowed him to access and activate the God Spirit Touch’s
gene potential and make the God Spirit Touch become deified. That
might have been why he was able to make the butterfly and create
the illusion of having an eleven armor talent. Perhaps that isn’t
his true talent. You should know that crystallizers can’t have a
gene talent that high.”</p>
<p>Exquisite sighed and said, “It is impossible. Eleven armor
talents exist only in legends. Han Sen isn’t bad, but I know he
can’t reach those mythical heights. But still, there must be a
reason for what transpired. In addition, I have seen for myself
that Han Sen is talented. And the geno art he uses can make other
creatures evolve. And that is impressive on its own. This power he
has is very rare. Even if his talent was ordinary, I would be
willing to make him my silkworm so I could study that geno art of
his. Plus, there is the chance he still has excellent talent.”</p>
<p>Upon hearing this, Bixi didn’t deny the possibility. He said,
“You are right. That power is so mysterious. Even our race doesn’t
have a geno art that could accomplish what Han Sen had done. That
miraculous geno art is more than enough reason for you to take him
on as your silkworm.”</p>
<p>“Since you agree, can you please bring this subject up for
discussion when we talk to Sky Palace tomorrow?” Exquisite
said.</p>
<p>Bixi nodded and said, “But before that, I need to go and test
Han Sen. I need to see his true power.”</p>
<p>Exquisite didn’t object to this. There were many stories
surrounding Han Sen, but she had never witnessed his abilities
directly. She wouldn’t place her faith in Han Sen’s skills until
she saw them first hand.</p>
<p>“Han Sen’s wounds have yet to heal. I don’t think we should
fight him. But if we don’t, how else should we test him?” Exquisite
asked.</p>
<p>“I have a way,” Bixi said without explaining.</p>
<p>Han Sen returned to his little jade island to heal. Fortunately,
the leader of Sky Palace forbade others from entering the island
and disturbing him. If people had been allowed to go and see him
after what had just happened, he wouldn’t have had a single second
of reprieve.</p>
<p>Han Sen had used his hands to produce a butterfly. That boosted
Han Sen’s reputation to a whole new level. Although Han Sen wasn’t
related to the people of Sky Palace by blood, his reputation was
one of the best of that whole generation. He was on par with Yu
Shanxin and Lone Bamboo.</p>
<p>When the story of Han Sen using his hands to produce a butterfly
reached Narrow Moon, many of the Rebate stunned at the news.</p>
<p>Some of the Rebate hadn’t liked it when Yisha decided to move
Narrow Moon, but now they were starting to change their minds. They
didn’t hate the concept of moving anymore.</p>
<p>“Han Sen is Knife Queen’s only student. Knife Queen offended the
Extreme King on his behalf and moved Narrow Moon next to Sky
Palace. So, Han Sen is with us. In the future, Han Sen will work
for the Rebate. He will bless us. Perhaps we will have a chance to
rise as well.” Many of the Rebate were thinking along these
lines.</p>
<p>After all this happened, a lot of the pressure that the Rebate
had been putting on Yisha abruptly fell away. The Kings that had
always been against her had changed their minds. They kept
mentioning the idea of bringing Han Sen over to bless them.</p>
<p>Yisha pretended not to hear those constant whisperings. She had
seen Han Sen’s blessing, and she knew it was something amazing. But
Yisha didn’t think that power could turn a dumpster fire into a
deified.</p>
<p>From what Yisha had seen, the people that were blessed by Han
Sen were already quite close to becoming deified. For someone who
already didn’t have a chance of becoming deified, it wouldn’t make
a difference no matter how many blessings were bestowed.</p>
<p>Yisha knew that Han Sen wouldn’t turn her down if she made a
request, so she didn’t ask just yet.</p>
<p>It wasn’t like she was too full of pride to ask for the help of
her student; there was simply no one in the Rebate that was
suitable for the blessing.</p>
<p>The Rebate were considered a higher race, but their ranking was
still low on that generous leaderboard. They had depended on the
support of the Jade Toad and the Extreme King to become a higher
race. Now that she was deified, she was the biggest supporter the
Rebate had.</p>
<p>She was the only being of her level within the Rebate. The only
Rebate close to being deified was Moon Wheel King, but he was old,
and his lifespan had almost reached its end. It was unknown if he
could become a deified after receiving a blessing. Even if he did,
though, he wouldn’t live long enough to do much for the Rebate.</p>
<p>Yisha couldn’t stop thinking about the fact that the Rebate had
no one special like Lando or Barr. It was giving her a headache. As
Yisha continued working, Bao’er ran into the hall and leaped into
her chest.</p>
<p>“Big Sister Queen!”</p>
<p>“Bao’er, why are you here?” Yisha stroked Bao’er’s head and
smiled.</p>
<p>Bao’er used to live in the palace with Yisha. Yisha had liked
her a lot and spoiled her quite a bit.</p>
<p>“Daddy brought me here,” Bao’er said with a smile.Yisha looked
ahead and saw Han Sen being led forward by a Rebate guard. He was
brought into the hall. She told the guard straight away, “Let him
in!”</p>
<p>“My Queen,” Han Sen said with a bow.</p>
<p>Yisha looked at Han Sen and observed how weak and frail his body
had become. She said, “Why aren’t you resting on the little jade
island? You shouldn’t be running around in this shape.”</p>
<p>Han Sen knew Yisha was referring to the fact that he had just
blessed the God Spirit Touch. He smiled and said, “I was just going
to listen to the Very High explain geno arts. I was pushed to the
stage to do something against my will.”</p>
<p>After that, Han Sen went on to say, “My body hasn’t recovered
yet. It will probably take a whole year. Maybe my Queen can pick
two or three people from the Rebate for me, and I will find the
time to bless them. It will help you all. If they aren’t talented
enough to become deified, they can still be made considerably
stronger.”</p>
<p>Yisha was very pleased. Han Sen had mentioned this without being
asked to. She believed she had made the right decision.</p>
<p>“It is a shame there are no psychics here that can calculate the
location of people. It is impossible to find Dollar now,” Yisha
thought to herself. She still hadn’t let her grudge against Dollar
go.</p>
<p>She wasn’t really looking for Dollar because of her grudge,
though. Yisha wanted to get the Rebate alpha’s scabbard back.</p>
