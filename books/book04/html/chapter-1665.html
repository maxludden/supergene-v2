    <p>
      In the distance, Han Sen could see a pure white donkey walking towards
      Shadow Shelter.
    </p>
    <p>
      The donkey was the size of any average donkey, but not a single speck of
      dirt muddied its pure white fur. A bronze bell was hanging around its
      neck, and whenever the creature moved, it gently tolled.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the donkey’s back, a human-looking person was riding it. It was
      difficult to discern his race from that distance, but he seemed to be clad
      in green clothing.
    </p>
    <p>
      The man was sitting with his legs crossed. He had one hand in front of his
      chest, with another clutching a necklace. He rubbed it a lot If you looked
      closely at the orbs of the necklace, you could see they weren’t what they
      initially seemed. They were very small skulls. Strangely small.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the skulls were rounded and polished like smooth stones. Most likely a
      result of long years of rubbing. It was like they were painted.
    </p>
    <p>
      But in the eye of every skeleton, you could still catch sight of a queer
      red light. Looking at the light in their sockets would make any observer
      feel nervous. It would almost feel as if the eyesocket was ready to suck
      you inside.
    </p>
    <p>
      As the man fondled the skulls, he chanted something with his eyes firmly
      closed. He looked very calm, as if he was simply sunbathing.
    </p>
    <p>
      The donkey was approaching Shadow Shelter now. The creature’s big eyes
      were fixed on Han Sen, who stood atop the tower.
    </p>
    <p>
      The donkey looked like a proud animal, and it looked at Han Sen from the
      corner of its eyes. It was like the creature was saying that, aside from
      the man on his back, he was the greatest there.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Fuck! Someone is waltzing up to the gate. I’m going to take people to
      kill them,” Cheap Sheep shouted, looking at the man and the donkey.
    </p>
    <p>
      “I won’t stop you if you want to die. But don’t take others down with
      you,” Gu Qingcheng said coldly. She didn’t look at the sheep when she
      spoke; her eyes were attached to the man on top of the donkey.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cheap Sheep was suddenly shocked, and he realized that the man below might
      be someone that he really shouldn’t offend.
    </p>
    <p>
      Han Sen looked at the man on the white donkey, and he could tell it was
      the man Gu Qingcheng had mentioned before. It was Ancient Devil.
    </p>
    <p>
      Although Han Sen had never seen Ancient Devil himself, the emperor had
      left a replica of himself in his old shelter in the Third God’s Sanctuary.
      That shadow looked exactly the same as Ancient Devil did. The only
      difference was the feeling of him.
    </p>
    <p>
      The shadow looked very holy, but Ancient Devil himself looked like an
      average guy. Aside from the skull necklace he clutched, he looked like a
      standard religious person.
    </p>
    <p>
      If Han Sen hadn’t known that the being in the Third God’s Sanctuary was
      only Ancient Devil’s shadow, everyone would believe it was the real
      Ancient Devil.
    </p>
    <p>
      Seeing that the donkey was now only two hundred meters away from the gate,
      Gu Qingcheng’s eyes looked icy as she drew out her sword. She sent out a
      swordlight that looked powerful enough to sunder the entire earth.
    </p>
    <p>
      The donkey acted as if it didn’t see the attack coming. It maintained the
      same speed as it trotted toward the gate.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the swordlight was just about to reach Ancient Devil’s head, he
      lifted the hand that was on his chest. With only his thumb, he reached out
      defiantly and touched Gu Qingcheng’s swordlight.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the skin of the thumb came into contact with the swordlight, it made
      the attack blend into his other four fingers like water. In that moment,
      the swordlight was absorbed. Ancient Devil then opened his hand, revealing
      the residue that was left.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ancient Devil opened his eyes and blew at the remains on his hand. The
      dust scattered with the wind and disappeared from sight
    </p>
    <p>
      The donkey came to a halt Then, Ancient Devil looked up at Han Sen who was
      atop the tower and smiled. “I am from Nonpure Mountain. I am Ancient
      Devil. Are you Skysword Han Sen?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “I am. What are you doing here, Ancient Devil Emperor? Does every elite
      want a shot at my life?” Han Sen said, looking at Ancient Devil.
    </p>
    <p>
      Han Sen would not underestimate this character, though. A man who had
      planned to kill God needed some respect, even if his attempt had not
      succeeded. His subordinates had been scary people, too. Sky King, Yaksha,
      Xiang Yin, Dragon King, and Asura. None of them were weak.
    </p>
    <p>
      As the master of those elites, he might have been betrayed by Asura, but
      he survived and thrived. He became a demigod after that. He was a legend
      of sorts.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ancient Devil smiled and said, “I am not an enemy of yours. A friend has
      asked me for a favor, and it concerns you.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Whether I can help depends on your friend, and what you’ll be asking of
      me,” Han Sen said coldly. But he already knew the answer.
    </p>
    <p>
      “The leader of Sacred is a good friend of mine. His young daughter Goddess
      was ignorant and naive. She offended you. I was hoping if you’d be kind
      enough to let her go. If you do this, I would appreciate it” Ancient Devil
      bowed towards him.
    </p>
    <p>“And what if I don’t?” Han Sen asked him.</p>
    <p>
      Ancient Devil, with his head still lowered, sighed and said, “You can save
      three-thousand-four-hundred-and-fifty-six lives.
    </p>
    <p>
      It’d be a good deed. If you’re a smart person, you’ll know what to do.”
    </p>
    <p>Hearing Ancient Devil say this, Han Sen looked murderous.</p>
    <p>The shelter’s population was 3456. No more, no less.</p>
    <p>
      “Did you kill Steel Wolf and Bone Witch?” Han Sen asked, his voice hard.
    </p>
    <p>
      “To give you a favor, I had to sacrifice those lives.” Ancient Devil
      looked remorseful.
    </p>
    <p>
      “You killed my people and say you are doing me a favor?” Han Sen laughed
      at him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ancient Devil responded, “If I hadn’t killed them, how would you know that
      I can kill 3456 lives? Now you know I could’ve killed everyone, but I
      didn’t I have done you 3456 favors. All these favors in exchange for
      Goddess’ life seems fair.”
    </p>
    <p>
      Everyone in the shelter was very angry, and Han Sen just laughed. “Good
      math, but you forgot to carry the one.”
    </p>
    <p>“What am I missing?” Ancient Devil looked confused.</p>
    <p>
      “You didn’t count your own life.” Han Sen teleported in front of Ancient
      Devil with his Split-Blade aimed at the man’s head.
