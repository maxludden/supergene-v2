    <p>
      The purple light that was being emitted from the woman&#8217;s body
      started to fade. Although she was truly mad, she still managed to limit
      how much power she exerted on her horny aggressor. If she hadn&#8217;t,
      with the power of someone who had unlocked her first gene lock, one kick
      would have been enough to end Han Sen.
    </p>

    <p>
      It was clear to her that something was wrong with Han Sen. So, despite her
      rage, she managed to put a cap on the damage she dealt him. Especially
      with the purple light, which she pushed into Han Sen&#8217;s body. This
      purple light would attempt to course its way through his body and clear
      his mind from any encroaching force.
    </p>

    <p>
      Although Han Sen&#8217;s body was suffering, he was able to feel a strange
      but gentle sensation flow throughout his insides. It seemed to help subdue
      and eliminate the effects of the red mushroom he had consumed.
    </p>

    <p>
      Clarity began returning to his mind, and when it had done so in a
      sufficient amount, he was able to close his eyes and focus on recasting
      Jade-Sun Force. He then started to absorb the purple light and the red
      mushroom into his kidney.
    </p>

    <p>
      When these two distinct forces entered his kidneys, they made the organs
      glow in their two representative colors. His kidneys then started to glow
      like red, purple, and gold nuggets. This bounty of power was going all
      around his body.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen felt tremendous joy in his heart. Having both of these powers
      consume and reinvigorate him, he felt as if his Jade-Sun Force was getting
      better and better. The process was quick and free from trouble, and it
      seemed that it would all be over soon.
    </p>

    <p>
      The woman summoned beast soul armor to cover her body and went to sit on a
      chair. She had a curious, complicated look on her face as she watched Han
      Sen, in between her blushing.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;I should have killed you.&#8221; The woman thought about the
      shameful scene and terrible groping she had been subjected to, and she
      looked at Han Sen with disgust.
    </p>

    <p>
      Queen had been travelling through the Icefield, and she had come to learn
      that Han Sen was living in the area from Huangfu Pingqing. So she thought
      to give him a visit and ask him something.
    </p>

    <p>
      Queen did not want to disturb or affect anyone else, so she came here
      alone during the night. With her skills of espionage, she knew she would
      not be discovered on her way there, but this was the last thing she had
      expected to happen.
    </p>

    <p>
      When she thought about her body being felt all over by a man like Han Sen,
      she wanted to slap him to death.
    </p>

    <p>
      But she was also conflicted with the knowledge that it was her disturbance
      that most likely prompted his out-of-character misdeeds. She didn&#8217;t
      blame Han Sen, but she again thought about how her body – which had never
      been touched by another man before – had been so vigorously fondled by
      someone in such a manner. She blushed deeply and gnawed at her teeth in
      uncertainty until she almost drew blood.
    </p>

    <p>
      But Queen had something else nibbling at the back of her mind. With her
      talents, she knew she should have fended Han Sen off and kept him away,
      but when she moved and used Heavenly Go, Han Sen was able to follow each
      step and block her way.
    </p>

    <p>
      Perhaps this could be largely attributed to the small size of the stone
      house, but there was also the element of surprise. She would never have
      expected Han Sen to possess a power such as this. It was this sudden shock
      that led to her disadvantage.
    </p>

    <p>
      She was the one who taught Han Sen Heavenly Go, but her calculations of
      his progress with the skill were obviously incorrect and had led to this
      grievous mistake. Her mind and body were not prepared, which was why she
      had been pushed to the wall.
    </p>

    <p>
      If Queen had been prepared for what was to happen, things would have been
      different and it would have been impossible for Han Sen to follow her
      steps and pin her to the wall.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;How did he do that?&#8221; Queen&#8217;s heart wondered to itself.
    </p>

    <p>
      She only taught Han Sen the bits and bobs of Heavenly Go, but he had
      already shown that his level with the skill was not too far behind hers.
      At this rate, it was inevitably going to get better.
    </p>

    <p>
      With Han Sen&#8217;s fitness, and the number of skills he actively
      trained, it was unlikely he would lose to her in an all-out fight, either.
    </p>

    <p>
      This surprised Queen a lot. She almost didn&#8217;t believe that the
      little amount of the skill she had taught Han Sen could have been
      developed to such a great degree.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen&#8217;s fitness was surprisingly powerful, too. His fitness was
      not too far behind hers, despite the fact that his first gene lock
      remained locked.
    </p>

    <p>
      From what she could could recall, Han Sen had only been in the Second
      God&#8217;s Sanctuary for just over a year. This wasn&#8217;t a popular
      place, and to attain such talents and abilities here in such a short time
      was almost terrifying.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;I was going to test his power, but that seems to be unnecessary
      right now. Perhaps when he unlocks his gene lock, I can allow him to join
      me. But&#8230;&#8221; Queen then thought back to the scene from earlier.
      Part of her wanted to leave and never lay eyes on this bastard again.
    </p>

    <p>
      But Queen was Queen, and she was of a greater resolve than most women. She
      did not leave. She just continued to sit there and look at Han Sen coldly.
    </p>

    <p>
      When Han Sen finally absorbed the red mushroom and purple light, although
      he hadn&#8217;t finished learning Jade-Sun Force as he had expected to,
      the horny side effects of the red mushrooms seemed to have totally
      disappeared. But it was worth noting that this minor victory had only been
      achieved through the aid of the purple light.
    </p>

    <p>
      Now that his kidney had absorbed the purple light, things seemed
      different. He believed that if he ate the red mushroom again, the
      horniness would not affect him.
    </p>

    <p>
      To test this out, all he would have to do was collect the final mushroom
      and eat it, then practice the Jade-Sun Force one last time to finish its
      training.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen opened his eyes and saw Queen in front of him, staring at him
      coldly. The scene and all its wretched sexual tension came rushing back to
      him. Imagining his prior grab of her boobies, he couldn&#8217;t help but
      stare at her chest.
    </p>

    <p>
      Excellent. They were excellent. Han Sen had laid eyes on many beautiful
      girls in his time, but this was the only stunner that was as powerful as
      he was. And her pair of boobs were in no way inferior to those possessed
      by Huangfu Pingqing. Everything about her was perfect, pretty much.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;If you have a death wish, then by all means, continue to
      stare.&#8221; Queen coldly looked at Han Sen. Her face did not display
      emotion, but anger continued to boil in her heart.
    </p>

    <p>
      If Han Sen&#8217;s behavior had not been triggered by her intrusion, she
      would have slapped him to death by now.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;I am sorry, but this is my room. You are the one who came in
      uninvited; you cannot blame me.&#8221; Han Sen was coughing when he said
      this.
    </p>

    <p>
      He saw the woman continue to peer at him, and it looked as if she wanted
      to kill him. His heart was stricken with a chill, so he quickly shuffled
      along the proceedings and asked, &#8220;Who are you, anyway? And why have
      you come here?&#8221;
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen had never seen Queen&#8217;s face before, and the lusty thoughts
      from earlier had messed up his head. Having light amnesia over what
      happened when he was beaten up, he had forgotten what skills Queen had
      used to beat him to a pulp.
    </p>

    <p>
      But Queen&#8217;s general temperament had tipped Han Sen into thinking he
      knew her from some place.
    </p>

    <p>&#8220;Queen,&#8221; Queen told him.</p>

    <p>
      Han Sen was flabbergasted. He said, &#8220;It&#8217;s you! Why are you
      here?&#8221;
    </p>

    <p>
      After Queen introduced herself, Han Sen understood why she seemed so
      familiar. Only someone with the power she possessed, dwarfing the presence
      of any other woman he had met before, could name herself Queen.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;I am just passing by. I was coming to see if you were able enough
      to join us on our hunt, but from what I have seen so far, I don&#8217;t
      think you are. When are you going to unlock your first gene lock?&#8221;
      Queen emotionlessly said.
    </p>

    <p>
      Queen had indeed been impressed with the skills and fitness Han Sen
      possessed, but it would be all for nought if he had not unlocked his first
      gene lock. Without doing that, he would never survive the fight she was
      going to take part in.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;I am afraid it will be a while yet before I unlock it, but I can
      still lend a hand in the hunting of creatures,&#8221; Han Sen responded.
    </p>

    <p>
      Queen didn&#8217;t say anything else, she just stood up and got ready to
      leave the room.
    </p>

    <p>
      The reason why she stayed was so she could ask that question and see how
      Han Sen responded. After all, it was because of her Han Sen behaved the
      way he did.
