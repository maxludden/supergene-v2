    <p>
      Han Sen looked at Xue Yi Yang, who bore the appearance of an ice demon. In
      his heart, he was shocked.
    </p>

    <p>
      The skill that Xue Yi Yang had just used might have beenJadeskin, but it
      was obviously different from the one that Han Sen had learned.
    </p>

    <p>
      Although theJadeskin Han Sen learned was easier to train while in cold
      air, unless you could lower your body temperature by two or three degrees,
      it was nearly impossible to gather as much frosted air as he had.
    </p>

    <p>
      If Xue Yi Yang could be described as ancient ice, Han Sen was cool jade by
      comparison. It was the same general hyper geno art, but it had been
      modified.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;You strike first. If I go first, you will not be given the
      opportunity to fight back.&#8221; Xue Yi Yang looked at Han Sen coldly.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Little Feng Feng, is Little Sen Sen going to make it? Although this
      Xue Yi Yan is rather annoying, his ice skills are truly powerful.&#8221;
      Lin Wei Wei looked at Xue Yi Yan who was like an ancient iceberg and
      couldn&#8217;t help herself from asking once again.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;He should be fine.&#8221; Lin Feng merely smiled, not seeming to
      display the slightest hint of agitation. Although it had been a long time
      since he had last seen Han Sen, he had been informed of Han Sen&#8217;s
      recent endeavors by Tang Zhenliu. Based on what he had heard, he did not
      think Xue Yi Yang would be able to beat him.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen didn&#8217;t seem to do anything except watch. He couldn&#8217;t
      tell whether or not Xue Yi Yang&#8217;sJadeskin was better than his or
      not. Because of this, he did not hold back. In a flash, his body began to
      shine and crystallize.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Little Sen Sen is quite good; has he managed to learn Nano Crystal
      at this age?&#8221; Lin Wei Wei was taken aback.
    </p>

    <p>
      No matter how he looked, Han Sen was still only around 20 years old. To
      learn Nano Crystal at such a young age was impressive because it generally
      took decades to learn it through a hyper geno art. The talent he possessed
      was quite surprising.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;He actually learned Nano Crystal? This man really is
      something.&#8221;
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;This can&#8217;t be real. How old is he? How has he learned Nano
      Crystal?&#8221;
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Yes, Nano Crystal is a lower-tier Qi Gong, but his talents are
      scarily good to have already learned it by his age.&#8221;
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;No wonder he&#8217;s a friend of Lin Feng. He is frighteningly
      talented!&#8221;
    </p>

    <p>&#8220;Which is stronger? Nano Crystal orJadeskin?&#8221;</p>

    <p>
      &#8220;According to current theory, there is a big difference between the
      two. Han Sen&#8217;s Nano Crystal has already been made, however. I am
      only afraid that theJadeskin Xue Yi Yang has learned is something recent
      and not fully developed. It&#8217;s impossible to tell who will emerge
      victorious.&#8221;
    </p>

    <p>…</p>

    <p>
      People from across the four families were discussing with ravenous
      interest the events unfolding before them. There was a man who looked
      quite similar to Xue Yi Yang sitting in a corner and coldly looking at the
      stage, devoid of emotion.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Xue Yi Kuang, your brother is an opponent in this battle.&#8221;
      Next to this cold-looking man, a bookwormish sort explained the situation.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;The only opponents that the Xue family have are other members of
      the Xue family,&#8221; Xue Yi Kuang said, not much caring for what the
      other person said. His confidence was enough to suffocate those in his
      presence.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Really?&#8221; The bookwormish man smiled but said nothing more.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen did not say anything. He just raised his fist and threw a punch,
      trying his hardest, knowing thatJadeskin was highly powerful. When going
      against the Xue family, he did not dare to underestimate the talents of
      his enemy. In each attack, he gave his all.
    </p>

    <p>
      His heart was jumping and thumping like an over-active generator, and the
      body that looked like crystal was annihilating the atmosphere around him.
      The sound of crackles, bursts, and bangs erupted from the air being
      pummelled near the human machine.
    </p>

    <p>
      Xue Yi Yang&#8217;s eyes went cold, and from the corner of his lips, a
      devilish smile arose. He cast an icy tornado that had the power to freeze
      the world and sent it hurtling towards Han Sen&#8217;s fists.
    </p>

    <p>Ping!</p>

    <p>
      Two fists collided, and the air at their meeting thundered. The air was
      swirling all about in distress, but neither of the fighters moved. The
      punch resounded with a boom. But after a second, Xue Yi Yang&#8217;s face
      changed. Blood dribbled from the corner of his lips.
    </p>

    <p>
      Everyone was aghast at the sight. No one would have expected one punch to
      injure Xue Yi Yang.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen&#8217;s eyes were still icy cold, and the fist was still pushing
      through Xue Yi Yang&#8217;s defenses. Xue Yi Yang screamed. He raised up
      his fist once more, but it lacked the strength of his first strike.
    </p>

    <p>
      The fists collided once more, and Xue Yi Yang started to bleed from his
      nose now. He was getting beaten by Han Sen, and he had to take a few steps
      back to rebalance and gather his composure. Han Sen was like a crystal
      demon, suppressing his every attack. Now a barrage of fists came his way,
      and though he desperately tried to dodge them, every thrown fist found its
      target. Although he managed to use his arm to block the hits, the sheer
      power of his attack continuously pushed him back. The blood from his mouth
      continued to spill.
    </p>

    <p>
      Everyone was frozen in their place, watching. No one had expected Han Sen
      to possess the power necessary to triumph over Xue Yi Yang, let alone beat
      him so badly that he couldn&#8217;t even attempt to fight back. The scary
      shadow was like an ancient demon, and he had the power to instill fear in
      all who saw him.
    </p>

    <p>
      The smile had quickly vanished from Ji Qing Qiu&#8217;s face. She did not
      expect Xue Yi Yang to get beaten by Han Sen, let alone beaten so harshly.
      He was injured from the first punch, and after that had no chance to fight
      back. The hits kept coming until his defeat. And now, blood leaked from
      multiple orifices. Xue Yi Yang was still screaming, but none of his
      attacks could match up to his cries.
    </p>

    <p>
      Ji Yanran was delighted. Although she had known Han Sen was very strong,
      even she did hadn&#8217;t believed that he had the power to beat someone
      from the Xue family so ferociously.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Wow, that is so strong! Where did this guy even come from? He
      can&#8217;t be from a Qi Gong family.&#8221;
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Is Nano Crystal really that powerful? Can it really
      suppressJadeskin like that?&#8221;
    </p>

    <p>&#8220;Awesome. That is so awesome!&#8221;</p>

    <p>&#8220;The Ji family has an amazing addition&#8230;&#8221;</p>

    <p>…</p>

    <p>
      Xue Yi Kuang&#8217;s eyes changed. He said two words: &#8220;Yin
      Force.&#8221;
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;This is an extremely powerful Yin Force. To have a Yin Force be
      practiced to such a terrifying degree, I am not sure any evolver can rival
      him,&#8221; the bookworm said.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Hmmm,&#8221; Xue Yi Kuang said, then said nothing more. As he
      looked at Han Sen, a murderous glint entered his eyes.
    </p>

    <p>Boom!</p>

    <p>
      Xue Yi Yang hopelessly accepted another punch. He felt his organs being
      pummelled and then felt as if his heart was ready to explode. He screamed
      again. His body began shining, and to expand in size. All of a sudden, he
      had taken on the appearance of a red-eyed monster. After this all of his
      attacks had kept being suppressed by Han Sen, he had opted to use a beast
      soul.
    </p>

    <p>
      Many people despised Xue Yi Yang&#8217;s new tactic, but he was desperate.
      If he did not want to concede, his final hope was in the summoning of a
      beast soul.
    </p>

    <p>
      Xue Yi Yang, through the addition of a beast soul, had increased his power
      by a great magnitude. His eyes were still incredibly cold, and he raised a
      fist towards Han Sen. Because his power had increased, the fist was able
      to teleport in front of Han Sen and prepare to sucker punch him with great
      force.
    </p>

    <p>This rage-fuelled fist could not even be seen by the audience.</p>

    <p>Pang!</p>

    <p>
      Han Sen did not change his expression and did not even look directly at
      the fist coming directly towards him. He simply raised up his right hand
      and pushed the incoming arm away from him.
