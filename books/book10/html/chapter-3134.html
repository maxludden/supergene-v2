<h3>Chapter 3134</h3>

<p>The purple blood eye butterfly king looked very weird. It was
like some butterfly that came from hell. Its wings had markings
that looked like flickering eyes. The mere sight of them gave
people the willies.</p>
<p>Although the amount of blood eye butterflies was shocking to
witness, Han Sen did not turn his gaze away from them. The peacock
king’s eye skill and blood eye butterfly king’s purple eye patterns
looked into each other. It suddenly made Han Sen have a
hallucination. He saw two shadows. He was seeing things. It was
only for a moment. After his body adjusted to the toxins, the
effect was immediately diminished.</p>
<p>It was merely about Han Sen being shocked. It was just a
king-class gene race that could go through the protection offered
by both the blood ghost spirit and gold wing peacock king. It was
weird.</p>
<p>The blood ghost spirit still had a young body. Han Sen
understood that it did not have enough power, but the gold wing
peacock king was ultimate mode. Yet, it was still unable to fully
repel the power of the blood eye butterfly’s toxins. That was hard
to believe.</p>
<p>Fortunately, Han Sen’s body was also really powerful. If he was
someone from the universe of kingdoms, even if he did have
god-class gene races to protect his body, he would have been
damaged already.</p>
<p>After Han Sen gave it some thought, he understood the meaning
behind all of it.</p>
<p>The universe of kingdom’s was all about gene race power. The
gold wing peacock king was strong. It had an indestructible blade.
Comparing the power and powers of destruction, the blood eye
butterfly was hardly comparable.</p>
<p>No matter how sharp its blades were, it could not hinder the
fire. The two of them were not of the same element.</p>
<p>The blood eye butterfly king’s toxic power was like that. With
the gold wing peacock king’s power, it was not the same. No matter
how strong the gold wing peacock king was, it could not block the
blood eye butterfly king’s power.</p>
<p>“Just using power will result in a problem. In a place like the
universe of kingdoms, if I use a gene race correctly, even if I use
a low-level gene race, it can kill a high-level elite. Let’s not
talk about assassinations.” Han Sen now understood.</p>
<p>He was used to being in the geno universe. He felt the elites
there were very strong and did not have many weaknesses.
Lower-level beings fighting higher level beings never came
easy.</p>
<p>In this world, the rules were a bit different. Ordinary humans
did not combine with gene races 24/7 because it would cost them
energy.</p>
<p>Using different gene race powers correctly was the key to
victory. One didn’t need very powerful gene races.</p>
<p>They only needed one of the same attack gene races. Wasting time
to grow another same element gene race was pointless.</p>
<p>“This mutant blood eye butterfly king’s toxic power is
interesting. Why don’t I turn it into an egg? Perhaps it will end
up useful.” Han Sen’s heart jumped. The peacock wings on his back
spread. Suddenly, a sky full of gold feathers descended like a rain
of arrows that killed many red eye butterflies.</p>
<p>In the blink of an eye, aside from the mutant blood eye
butterfly king, all the other blood eye butterflies were killed.
After all, it was a god-class, ultimate-mode, combination gene
skill. Besides the ordinary blood eye butterflies being unable to
block the attack, even the mutant blood eye butterfly king could
not.</p>
<p>Han Sen wanted to take the mutant blood eye butterfly king with
him, which was why he allowed to live.</p>
<p>The mutant blood eye butterfly king was shocked. It flapped its
weird purple wings as Han Sen tried to catch up to it. The blood
eye butterfly king had just turned when Han Sen cast the Xuan
Yellow Sutra. A scary power struck the mutant blood eye butterfly
king, turning it into a purple, crystal-like egg.</p>
<p>He picked up the mutant blood eye butterfly king egg. When Han
Sen flew back, Mister God One and the others were already near the
platform.</p>
<p>Mister God One offered a compliment by saying, “Mister Han
really is different. You do not just have a blood ghost spirit
power, but you have that gold arrow gene race. That is even
scarier. It cannot be an ordinary ultimate god-class gene race.</p>
<p>Han Sen did not plan on hiding anything. He laughed and said,
“You are smart. This is a mutant god-class gene race.”</p>
<p>“Holy shit! Old Han, you are rich! You even have a mutant
god-class that is in ultimate mode. With the blood ghost spirit,
you’ll have enough money to afford a city.” Bald Guy really admired
Han Sen. “What do we do with the skinning hide?” Han Sen ignored
Bald Guy. Mister God One replied, “The skinning hide is good for
feeding a gene race and evolving them. Using a skinning hide to
evolve a gene race provides a high chance of one learning new
skills. Let’s just put it away and share it when we return.”</p>
<p>“OK,” Han Sen said with a nod.</p>
<p>Everyone started to pull out the skinning hide. There were a lot
of skinning hides. There were 10,000 of them. Mister God One
prepared a giant bag in which they could stuff them into so the
presence of the skinning hide could go undetected.</p>
<p>After putting the skinning hide away, everyone started to
dig.</p>
<p>Without the temptation of the skinning hide, no more gene races
approached that place. The digging process went smoothly. Not long
later, they dug up a jade gene egg speckled with black dots. A
weird light emanated from it. A powerful presence surrounded it.
Han Sen felt</p>
<p>it.</p>
<p>Bald Guy said with bright and wide eyes, “If I have guessed
right, this is a god-class gene race called half sky hawk. It’s its
gene egg.”</p>
<p>“What a shame. There is only one god-class gene race here.”
Mister God One thought for a moment and suggested, “How about this?
The half sky hawk gene egg can be considered one-half of the goods,
and the skinning hide can be considered the other. I will let you
choose, Brother Han.”</p>
<p>“If you let me pick, I will have to go for it.” Han Sen receded
into thought for a moment. He turned to Bald Guy and asked, “What
do you think?”</p>
<p>“The half sky hawk is good stuff. It is a rare flying gene race,
but the skinning hide is rare too,” Bald Guy quietly said. “It is
very good for the evolution of gene races… Whatever… Pick the
skinning hide. You already have one mutant god-class gene race.
Having a half sky hawk will be pointless.”</p>
<p>“In that case, I will take the half sky hawk,” Han Sen said
while pointing at the half sky hawk gene egg. Mister God One handed
Han Sen the gene egg and honestly said, “OK. That actually benefits
me. After all, the skinning hide is rarer.”</p>
<p>“That’s fine.” Han Sen collected the half sky hawk gene egg. He
gave it to Bald Guy and said, “I will give it to you now. When we
next share things, you have already earned your share.”</p>
<p>Han Sen had seen Bald Guy staring at the half sky hawk gene egg.
It was obvious that was what he wanted. He was only thinking about
what was best for Han Sen, which was why he picked the skinning
hide.</p>
<p>Bald Guy was shocked and happy. “Old Han, I am not going to say
much. I will take the gene egg, and I will return the favor. From
this point on, you can have everything of mine. I do not need
anything more.”</p>
<p>“Are you sure you don’t need anything? You’re not going to
regret it, are you?” Han Sen looked like he was smiling at Bald
Guy, but he wasn’t smiling</p>
<p>“Ha! Ha! I, Bald Guy, keep my promises. When I say I do not need
anything else, I do not need anything else.” Bald Guy touched the
gene egg as he spoke.</p>
