<p>Miss Mirror sat in front of her computer. She looked at the
information on the screen, locked in deep thought.</p>
<p>All the documents pertained to Han Sen. It was everything that
had been recorded of him since the fight when Kong Fei had snuffed
out and relit a lantern. It informed her of everything he did, all
the way up until he disguised himself as Bai Yi. The records of it
were all there.</p>
<p>“Such a scary guy. These records make his life look like he’s
playing with cheat codes. He has done way too many unbelievable
things. It is difficult to imagine that a leftover crystallizer,
starting from scratch, achieved all that he has today.” The
investigation was very thorough. Miss Mirror had to admit that if
she had been in the same situation as Han Sen, she wouldn’t have
been able to achieve half of what Han Sen had managed to.</p>
<p>“It is a shame that he isn’t really Bai Yi. Otherwise, with his
performance amongst the Extreme King, he might have become a
legendary figure for us.” Miss Mirror sighed. She turned off the
computer and rubbed her temples.</p>
<p>She had been tired for a while. The person who had her Mirror
Spirit Eye Ring was disguising himself as a prince. It made things
rather difficult for her. She couldn’t tell King Bai about it, but
neither could she lie to him. And King Bai wasn’t an easy man to
fool. Lying to him might lead her down a path she could never
return from.</p>
<p>“Radiowave should be investigating Han Sen. If they start
uncovering his secrets too quickly, things might go badly for me.
And if I had Han Sen over, I’m afraid the Mirror Spirit Eye won’t
be able to withstand the same dosage of damage again.” Miss Mirror
was beginning to develop a headache.</p>
<p>Miss Mirror closed her eyes to think, but she couldn’t figure
out a solution that was perfect for her.</p>
<p>A subordinate knocked at her door. “Miss Mirror, the location of
the seven-five-six-eight God Battle Ruin has been confirmed.”</p>
<p>“Give me the information.” Miss Mirror sat up straight, looking
like a lady again.</p>
<p>The subordinate pushed open the door and set the documents down
in front of her. Miss Mirror examined them for a while and frowned.
She said, “Another race has been found? At Ruin 7568?”</p>
<p>“Yes, my lady. Our people found a big excavation site, and some
construction zones started up not too long ago,” the subordinate
explained.</p>
<p>“Okay, that’s all for now.” Miss Mirror set the documents back
down on the table. She closed her eyes and thought.</p>
<p>A while later, she opened her eyes. She glanced over the pages
again, then finally smiled. She said out loud, “Ruin 7568… If that
is the one, perhaps I can convince my brother. I can take Han Sen
there. This is an opportunity.”</p>
<hr />
<p>For the first time in a while, things were going smoothly. Han
Sen had the small furnace to show him the way, and he had collected
many core xenogeneic genes. Now, he was holding four. He ate two
and tossed the others to the furnace.</p>
<p>It wasn’t because Han Sen was a waster. It was just because he
couldn’t digest them. Even with Consume’s help, he could only eat
two a day. If he wanted to gain one hundred King class genes, it
would take more than a month.</p>
<p>Because the small furnace behaved well, Han Sen gave it a few
core xenogeneic genes whenever he could. The small furnace was
always delighted to receive them.</p>
<p>Swords from the Furnace required core xenogeneic genes for
production. But core genes from different xenogeneics could create
different swords inside the furnace.</p>
<p>“No wonder that big furnace was so strong. All the swords it
produced came from King xenogeneic genes. I can’t even guess how
many King class core xenogeneics it managed to kill in its time.
Too bad the xenogeneic genes are melted down inside the furnace. If
a furnace is destroyed, the swords are also destroyed. Otherwise,
I’d have received enough xenogeneic genes to last me many lives
over,” Han Sen thought with regret.</p>
<p>The small furnace followed Han Sen and collected a few treats on
the way. When Han Sen left the core area, it didn’t run off. It
waited for Han Sen to come back.</p>
<p>A few days later, the small furnace was forging a few sword
blanks.</p>
<p>Han Sen thought this relaxed schedule would last for some time,
but when Miss Mirror showed up, she destroyed his delusions of just
enjoying life for a while.</p>
<p>“Pack your stuff, you have a mission to go on,” Miss Mirror said
before taking a sip of tea.</p>
<p>“What mission?” Han Sen asked with trepidation. Miss Mirror had
asked him to pack, so that meant he was leaving King’s Kingdom.</p>
<p>“This is your father’s handwriting. Is there a problem?” Miss
Mirror asked, setting a note down on the table as she spoke.</p>
<p>“Yes. Can I bring my subordinates with me?” Han Sen asked.</p>
<p>“I suppose you can, but are you sure about taking them someplace
dangerous?” Miss Mirror looked like she was smiling, but she
wasn’t.</p>
<p>Han Sen knew Miss Mirror was referring to Bao’er. She was
warning Han Sen not to attempt an escape. He wouldn’t have a chance
to.</p>
<p>“If I can, I would like to bring Bao’er,” Han Sen said,
pretending not to know what she meant.</p>
<p>“Sure, but I have already told you; this place is dangerous. If
something happens, don’t blame your auntie for not warning you,”
Miss Mirror said.</p>
<p>“I will be responsible for this decision,” Han Sen said
tonelessly.</p>
<p>“Good. Go and prepare. We will be leaving tonight.” With that,
Miss Mirror turned and promptly left Underwater Town.</p>
<p>Han Sen called for Bao’er. He left the Blood Kirin behind in
Underwater Town to look after Lan Haixin, just in case she decided
to stir up trouble.</p>
<p>Han Sen wasn’t planning an escape. The Extreme King were too
powerful. Unless he had a reliable backup plan, he wouldn’t flee.
He couldn’t go back to Planet Eclipse, either. He didn’t want to
drag Yisha into his problematic affairs.</p>
<p>Han Sen wanted to bring Bao’er because he didn’t feel safe
leaving her alone. Plus, he was used to having Bao’er around.
Whenever he was alone, it always felt like he was missing
something.</p>
<p>He asked the Blood Kirin to watch Lan Haixin. Lilly begged Han
Sen to take her with him, but he refused.</p>
<p>Miss Mirror had said that the place was dangerous, and Han Sen
didn’t think she told him that just to scare him. He was bringing
Bao’er along because she could protect herself. Lilly was just a
Duke. She would be unable to protect herself, and bringing her
would be like handing her a death sentence.</p>
<p>He brought Bao’er to the rally point, knowing that they wouldn’t
be going alone. Many members of Spring Rain had already gathered.
There were many Kings and half-deifieds, and Han Sen even saw two
fully deified warriors amongst them.</p>
<p>“What are they doing here?” Han Sen wondered. This was enough
combat power to annihilate a higher race.</p>
<p>When the ship started to move, Miss Mirror didn’t come looking
for him. Han Sen had free time, so he practiced and consumed King
class genes.</p>
<p>Han Sen started trying to push Jadeskin’s self-universe
cogwheel. He wanted to get Jadeskin up to King class. That progress
would be much easier than leveling up the Dongxuan Sutra. It would
only be a matter of time.</p>
<p>The ship flew through many space teleportation points. When the
ship arrived at their ultimate destination, Han Sen was shocked. He
knew the place.</p>
<p>“Isn’t this the xenogeneic space that Ning Yue mentioned?” Han
Sen wondered.</p>
