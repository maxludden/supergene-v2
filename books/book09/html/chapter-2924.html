<h2>Killing the Black Dragon</h2>
<h3>Chapter 2924</h3>

<p>Blood that looked like crystals was coming out of all of his
wounds. God only knew how many bones had been broken in his body.
It made Han Sen’s entire presence look terrible.</p>
<p>The black-scaled dragon was very excited. It kept firing dragon
breath. All its dragon scales cut across Han Sen’s body. The beast
really enjoyed killing, and it was not in a rush to use the stone
lantern to get rid of Han Sen.</p>
<p>Pang!</p>
<p>Han Sen’s shoulder was struck by the dragon eye light. His left
shoulder bone totally vanished. It was like he had been bitten by
an invisible monster. The wound shone with blood crystals.</p>
<p>Han Sen was in extreme pain. He frowned, but his expression did
not change. He coldly looked at the black dragon and said, “Are you
having fun?”</p>
<p>Han Sen’s body was now riddled with a thousand holes. There was
no telling how many times the black dragon had hit him. If Han Sen
had been an ordinary true god xenogeneic, he would have died.</p>
<p>Luckily, Han Sen’s body had been reinforced four times. That was
what had enabled him to survive up until now.</p>
<p>Of course, he had deliberately done that. Otherwise, half of the
wounds on his body could have been avoided. Han Sen had not planned
on dodging. He even deliberately used his body to make sure he got
hit. The only attacks he evaded were the ones that would have
surely killed him.</p>
<p>“Roar!” The black dragon did not care about any of that. It
released some dragon cries. It wanted to hurt Han Sen again.</p>
<p>This time, Han Sen did not allow his body to take the hit. He
pulled out a Buddha light, which was shaped like a moon, from his
waist. It was a very thin knife.</p>
<p>The moment Han Sen pulled out the knife, the Buddha light
covered his body. Han Sen’s wounds almost instantly disappeared.
His body was back in tip-top condition.</p>
<p>The cause karma knife unleashed the Buddha light on his
aggressor. It was like a sun flooding the universe in bright
light.</p>
<p>Han Sen did not say anything. He slashed toward the black-scaled
dragon’s dragon cry attack. The scary knife light was like a blade
that tore through the sky. It broke the dragon cry’s shockwaves and
proceeded toward the black dragon.</p>
<p>He used the cause karma knife for this attack because it had the
ability to absorb all the damage he had just endured. The power
that had accumulated was almost equal to all of the attacks Han Sen
had accepted. With Han Sen’s own power, along with the powerful
knife skills, even a true god top-class xenogeneics like the
black-scaled dragon was shocked. It did not dare accept such an
attack. It twisted its body. It was like a dragon in space trying
to escape.</p>
<p>It was a shame it had underestimated the cause karma knife power
so much. The cause was already there, and the karma would come. The
black-scaled dragon had to use its own power to block it. It could
not escape the light.</p>
<p>The dragon saw the knife light coming right for it. It was
tearing through space. No matter what the beast tried to do, it
could not establish a distance between it. It lowered its head,
wanting to blow the stone lantern in its hands. It wanted to use
the stone lantern’s fire power to break this attack.</p>
<p>The dragon breath came out from its mouth as if it was miles
away. It was unable to blow the lantern flame in front of him.</p>
<p>Han Sen’s time area could not affect the stone lantern, but it
was able to affect the black dragon. Han Sen used a time area to
limit the dragon from emitting its dragon presence. He delayed his
opponent to buy time. The dragon presence could not reach the flame
of the lantern, which was actually quite close to it.</p>
<p>When the dragon realized what was going on, it was too late. At
that moment, the knife light came down. It struck the black
dragon’s forehead.</p>
<p>The black dragon was past the point of no return. It did not
plan on doing anything else. It gathered up power and used its head
to take the hit.</p>
<p>Katcha!</p>
<p>Dragon blood came out like a spring of water. The dragon’s head
was cut open by Han Sen’s knife. It was cut clean through the
center. The purple knife light also traveled through it with a
scary ripping power. The way the power went forward was like it was
splitting bamboo. It cut open half of the black dragon’s big
body.</p>
<p>Han Sen did not have time to see if the black dragon was dead or
not. His body flashed and teleported directly before the black
dragon. He took the stone lantern.</p>
<p>If it was not for the stone lantern, even though it was a true
god elite, Han Sen would not have had so much trouble eliminating
the fiend.</p>
<p>Han Sen grabbed the stone lantern and teleported away. He
teleported to another of the dragon’s talons. He wanted to retrieve
the Shield of the Medusa’s Gaze.</p>
<p>Before his fingers touched the shield, the black dragon’s claws
swept backward. Its body, which had been cut in half, was combined
again. The wounds instantly recovered like it had not been injured
before.</p>
<p>“That’s a very powerful body recovery power,” Han Sen
complimentarily said.</p>
<p>The body recovery power of dragon xenogeneics was strong. This
black dragon, in particular, was quite outstanding. It was like it
had an immortal body.</p>
<p>The black-scale dragon saw the stone lantern being taken and he
was furious. Black clouds rose and carried endless suppression on
its way toward Han Sen.</p>
<p>“Ignorant little dragon! How dare you offend God’s Father. If
you do not stop, I am going to kill you!” Han Sen was holding the
stone lantern. He generated his Xuan Yellow Sutra power. He pointed
at the flame and pierced it.</p>
<p>When the Xuan Yellow power went through the flame, it touched
the white flame. It made the Xuan Yellow power turn white. It was
headed for the black-scales dragon.</p>
<p>Han Sen felt like the stone lantern was something of a booster.
After the Xuan Yellow Sutra was cast through the lantern, the power
had been increased by a great magnitude.</p>
<p>Buzz!</p>
<p>The Xuan Yellow Sutra broke the dragon presence and landed on
the black-scaled dragon. Han Sen saw the dragon’s giant black
self-cogwheel get pushed by the Xuan Yellow power. It was spinning
backward.</p>
<p>The black-scaled dragon’s face changed as its body began to
twitch and transform. It tried to fight the Xuan Yellow power, but
nothing worked. Its body quickly devolved, and its power went weak.
He went from true god to butterfly class.</p>
<p>Han Sen was happy. With the power he had, it should have been
hard to turn the black-scaled dragon’s self-cogwheel. Now, he had
the stone lantern to close the gap. He made the big, black-scaled
dragon turn into butterfly class. It didn’t take long, but it was
still very shocking.</p>
<p>“This is a very good stone lantern! It is so powerful. I am
afraid this is stronger than a god personality armament like Sky
Vine Radish.” Han Sen was elated.</p>
<p>Now, he did not have the time to admire his handiwork. He pulled
out his knife and slashed toward the black-scaled dragon.</p>
<p>The dragon had been true god class, so Han Sen was unable to
beat it. Now that it was butterfly class, Han Sen could easily beat
the black-scaled dragon.</p>
<p>Using the time area, the black-scaled dragon was unable to
escape. It slashed like mad, cutting the black-scaled dragon into
pieces.</p>
<p>The black-scaled dragon was not dead yet. Han Sen used his Under
the Sky Knife skill. It made countless knife lights cross each
other. It cut the dragon’s body to pieces.</p>
<p>The dragon’s body was becoming true god class again. It was
going to put its body back together again after it had been sliced
into pieces. Han Sen saw something shining inside the dragon’s
mouth. He slashed and broke the shiny thing.</p>
<p>Blergh!</p>
<p>The dragon’s dead body was like a leaking balloon. It quickly
deflated. Dragon blood started to gush out. Han Sen was covered
with dragon blood.</p>
