<p>In the days that followed, Han Sen didn’t eat or drink much. He
spent all his time modifying Under the Sky and Break Six Skies.</p>
<p>Under the Sky wasn’t very compatible with Break Six Skies, so
Han Sen would have to use his dual pistols from Spell to channel
the power. And Break Six Skies had to be modified, as well. He
might not be using the geno art’s full destructive capability, but
the explosive power had to be sufficient to annihilate God’s Knife.
Only by doing that could Han Sen perform his one-second judgment
into the past.</p>
<p>This was a very big project. Han Sen focused all his attention
on modifying the skills. He wanted to make the technique as perfect
as possible. God’s Knife was such a scary being. If there was the
slightest flaw in his plan, Han Sen would lose the fight and
die.</p>
<p>But Han Sen was confident that he had what it took. Sooner or
later, he’d make it work.</p>
<p>“Now that I have sorted out how to deal with the Super Space
Slash problem, I must move on to the last problem that is standing
in my way. How can I actually destroy God’s Knife?” While Han Sen
was practicing, he mulled over this next task.</p>
<p>If he was unable to destroy God’s Knife, blocking Super Space
Slash was pointless. Reaching a stalemate would be the same as
losing. Gu Wan’er would remain trapped either way.</p>
<p>But with Han Sen’s current resources and power, he couldn’t
defeat God’s Knife.</p>
<p>“If I can’t break it, then I must find a way to trap it. Maybe
Turtle would be a good choice for that, but I just don’t know if it
will work on God’s Knife.”</p>
<p>Han Sen realized that his imagination alone wouldn’t be enough
to solve the problem. Whether he was attempting to predict his
opponent’s attack vector or trying to determine the effectiveness
of Turtle, he needed to perform real-world tests. He had to see how
his plans worked out in proper combat.</p>
<p>“It looks like I still need to go to God’s Farm. I wonder if
God’s Knife is still on the Demon Sheep Planet?” Once Han Sen
finished modifying Under the Sky and Break Six Skies, he planned to
go to God’s Farm.</p>
<p>“The path other people walk is the path for them. I have to walk
my own path.” Han Sen continued not to eat and drink, and he kept
chipping away at his modifications to the geno arts. He didn’t
sleep or rest for two weeks.</p>
<p>Every time he thought of Gu Wan’er having to use her own blood
to feed that knife every day, Han Sen’s heart ached.</p>
<p>Before the modification works were finished, Exquisite came
back. But this time, it was only her. Li Keer didn’t join her.</p>
<p>“The leader still isn’t willing to let me out?” Han Sen asked,
glancing at Li Keer. He was already prepared.</p>
<p>Exquisite didn’t answer Han Sen. She only coldly told him to
follow her. Then, she flew toward the mist.</p>
<p>Han Sen was surprised. This was well beyond his wildest
expectations. Exquisite was going to lead him out of the bottle.
Han Sen had never expected the Very High to actually free him.</p>
<p>But if he was able to leave there so easily, he wasn’t going to
hesitate or complain. He flew to catch up with Exquisite, and he
followed her through the mist.</p>
<p>“Does the leader believe that I’m not cursed?” Han Sen asked
Exquisite.</p>
<p>“Don’t say or ask anything. I’ve got this. You just need to be
quiet and follow me,” Exquisite said without even looking at
him.</p>
<p>Han Sen could feel there was something amiss here, but he didn’t
dare to speak again. He remained silent and followed after
Exquisite.</p>
<p>Exquisite guided the two of them through the mist, and they
eventually emerged outside the bottle.</p>
<p>The hall that held the bottle had such powerful restrictions
that they didn’t need a Very High to guard the place. Exquisite had
used a small stamp to enter, and it kept the restrictions from
affecting her. She led Han Sen out of the hall.</p>
<p>After exiting the hall, Exquisite placed her hand on Han Sen’s
shoulder. She was going to teleport both of them away from that
place.</p>
<p>But Han Sen took her hand, stopping her from using Galaxy
Teleport.</p>
<p>Exquisite looked at Han Sen with confusion, and Han Sen looked
back at her with a very serious expression. In a quiet voice, he
said, “Answer my question. Are you taking me to the leader?”</p>
<p>Exquisite hesitated a bit, but then she shook her head and said,
“No.”</p>
<p>With that answer, Han Sen was almost certain that his guess was
correct. He persisted and asked Exquisite, “The leader hasn’t given
you permission to take me out of the bottle world, has he?”</p>
<p>“You don’t need to concern yourself with such matters. I’m
taking you away from Outer Sky. After you leave Outer Sky, you
should go back to Sky Palace. Tell everything that happened here to
Zhang Xuandao. If he is willing to keep you, I don’t think our
leader will try to take you back from Sky Palace,” Exquisite
said.</p>
<p>Han Sen’s expression became unreadable. He knew what was
happening now. Exquisite was taking a huge risk. She was breaking
the rules and setting him free on the sly.</p>
<p>Han Sen had never expected that Exquisite might do something
like this for him.</p>
<p>Han Sen had only thought of Exquisite as a tool for accelerating
his growth, but now, he couldn’t consider her that way anymore.</p>
<p>“Why?” Han Sen asked, giving Exquisite a complex look.</p>
<p>“You came into this place alive. I’m going to make sure you
leave this place the same way,” Exquisite said with an emotionless
look.</p>
<p>“If I leave, what is going to happen to you?” Han Sen knew the
Very High’s rules were strict. The Very High could be an extremely
heartless people. If someone broke the rules, they wouldn’t look on
the transgression kindly.</p>
<p>“Nothing much will happen. All I have done is set my silkworm
free. It isn’t a big deal. And I have other things to do, anyway.
Stop wasting my time,” Exquisite said coldly.</p>
<p>Han Sen nodded and said, “Yes. We really can’t waste any time.
Take me back to the bottle world.”</p>
<p>Exquisite froze. Then, she looked at Han Sen with confusion and
asked, “You don’t want to leave?”</p>
<p>“That is correct. If you had destroyed your contract with me and
trapped me in the bottle world and scolded me, someday I would put
my knife to your neck and leave this place by force.” Han Sen
paused, and then he went on to say, “But if you let me go like
this, I will feel very guilty. I cannot owe someone this much.”</p>
<p>Han Sen hadn’t been with the Very High for very long, but he had
taken the time to read their cruel rules. He knew what would happen
if she let him go. She might not be killed, but she would be
imprisoned for a century.</p>
<p>Han Sen’s personality wouldn’t allow that to happen. He didn’t
mind fighting people. No matter how cruel the enemy was, he could
find a way to kill them. But he was afraid of people treating him
too kindly. He didn’t want to owe anyone too much.</p>
<p>Han Sen didn’t know how he could pay back a woman who had wasted
her youth on him. He didn’t want Exquisite to be in jail on his
behalf for a hundred years. So, he had no choice but to stay.</p>
<p>Of course, Han Sen also had a plan. His situation wasn’t
hopeless. If it had been hopeless, he would have simply left and
taken Exquisite with him.</p>
<p>But he couldn’t do that just yet, because Exquisite might not
completely betray the Very High to be with him. So, Han Sen had to
reject Exquisite’s good intentions.</p>
<p>“You won’t owe me anything. This isn’t a big deal,” Exquisite
said to Han Sen casually.</p>
<p>“How can a century of jail time be considered nothing? How many
centuries can you even live for?” Han Sen asked.</p>
<p>“How did you know that?” Exquisite was shocked.</p>
<p>“Send me back.” Han Sen didn’t answer. He calmly looked at
Exquisite with soft eyes.</p>
<p>“You need to know that if you miss this chance, you risk being
trapped inside the bottle’s world forever.” Exquisite looked at Han
Sen with a conflicted expression.</p>
<p>“No, I will not. I will use my powers to leave. Nothing can trap
me there,” Han Sen said firmly. His face looked so confident, as if
he was telling her that 1 + 1 = 2.</p>
