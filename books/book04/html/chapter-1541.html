	<p>Goddess’ mind was still clear, despite her anger. She could feel that Han Sen’s butterfly wings were emitting a
		horrible aura. It wasn’t anything normal, and she could already guess it was most likely a super geno core he
		was using.</p>

	<p>Goddess did not know where Han Sen’s super geno core had come from, but she wasn’t going to be careless. She
		pulled out her God Ring again and tried to capture Han Sen and bind him.</p>

	<p>“Young Super Creature Black Back Dog killed. No beast soul gained. Geno Core unobtained. The flesh is edible.
		Collect the Life Geno Essence to gain zero-to-ten super geno points.”</p>

	<p>The announcement played in Han Sen’s head, but he did not have the time to listen. The God Ring was coming for
		him.</p>

	<p>Little Jade Lion King’s mood was a little conflicted, at the moment. Although Lion Mountain was strong, Sacred
		wasn’t weak. He didn’t really want to fight Goddess; after all, it was why he had chosen to stall her earlier.
	</p>

	<p>Now Goddess was mad, and many creatures lunged forward to engage with Han Sen at once. Little Jade Lion was of a
		split mind in what to do.</p>

	<p>Ultimately, Little Jade Lion gritted his teeth and yelled to Goddess, “Goddess, stop this! Otherwise, I’ll have
		to be cruel.”</p>

	<p>Goddess harshly responded, “This human is dead! It’s none of your business, but if you choose to help him, I
		won’t be letting you go again.”</p>

	<p>Little Jade Lion King saw that she was fully committed to murdering Han Sen, so he commanded his subordinates to
		move forward and do battle with the rest of Sacred’s troops. He didn’t fight, but he didn’t stop Goddess
		directly, either.</p>

	<p>Little Jade Lion didn’t want this to go any bigger than it already had, so he thought he had discovered a way in
		which he could quell the madness.</p>

	<p>Han Sen did not care much for anything else. He flapped his wings and evaded the incoming God Ring. He was flying
		directly towards Goddess.</p>

	<p>“Is that guy really Han Sen? Why does he have a super geno core?” Yu Xuan couldn’t believe that was Han Sen, and
		he thought the human looked like a god as he attacked.</p>

	<p>Yu Miao looked at the battle with excitement. “It doesn’t matter how or why he has a super geno core. Our chance
		to proceed has come. When Lion Mountain and Sacred are both injured, we can strike and claim the Godlight Tunnel
		for ourselves.”</p>

	<p>“Shit! Han Sen is really that strong? He killed a high-level creature of Sacred just like that! This is crazy.”
		Tang Zhenliu was in shock at the spectacle.</p>

	<p>Queen had been forced to fight Lion Mountain’s creatures alongside her companions. Her eyes looked bright.</p>

	<p>She became one of the early demigods of humanity, but she had been unlucky to end up in Sacred Shelter as the
		subordinate of creatures. Her leveling process had been extremely slow, and she had only managed to obtain a
		gold geno core.</p>

	<p>Queen knew the Black Back Dog was strong, but Han Sen had managed to kill it with one strike. It showed her that
		Han Sen was again the best of the best, possibly out of everything and everyone in the Fourth God’s Sanctuary.
	</p>

	<p>“He hasn’t been heard from in ten years. I didn’t know he had actually come so far.” Queen sighed.</p>

	<p>By using time and space in her movements, she put on the show of fighting, more than anything. She disappeared
		and jumped around a lot, not really engaging them. Above all, she wanted to focus on watching how Han Sen
		battled Goddess.</p>

	<p>Goddess saw Han Sen dodge the ring and come for her, but she wasn’t afraid. She summoned a short sword and swung
		it towards him.</p>

	<p>The short sword was black, and when she swung it, it emitted a black light, as if it was tearing a veil through
		space.</p>

	<p>“Split-Knife? Goddess brought out her Split-Knife! The Sacred master must be very fond of her.” Yu Miao sounded
		jealous.</p>

	<p>Split-Knife was a famous geno core belonging to Sacred Shelter. It could cut through anything, and it was said to
		be indestructible.</p>

	<p>When the master of Split-Knife was still alive, it broke countless geno cores belonging to super creatures. Its
		name was quite well-known across all of the Fourth God’s Sanctuary.</p>

	<p>Although Split-Knife was not a berserk super geno core, its power was still better than many berserks, anyway.
	</p>

	<p>“If Goddess brought Split-Knife here with her, Han Sen is sure to die. He is so ignorant. He manages to get a
		little bit of power and then acts stupidly reckless. He deserves to die, really,” Yu Xuan said dismissively.</p>

	<p>While Yu Xuan and Yu Miao discussed this, Han Sen moved in front of Goddess. The Split-Knife in her hand was
		being swung right at him.</p>

	<p>Little Jade Lion King was shocked, and he said, “Goddess brought Split-Knife? He is so dead. It’s not like I
		don’t want to save you, it’s just that I really can’t.”</p>

	<p>Dong!</p>

	<p>When everyone thought Han Sen was dead, they saw him raise his arm to try to block her attack.</p>

	<p>“He is too naive. Not even super creatures can block that knife,” everyone thought.</p>

	<p>The next second, Han Sen’s arm displayed a shield that looked like a black crab. It managed to successfully block
		the strike.</p>

	<p>Split-Knife’s black swordlight crashed into the shield, but not even that was able to penetrate the defense of
		the arm shield. It only left a scratch that was around one inch deep.</p>

	<p>“How is that possible? And what is that shield? How could it block Split-Knife?” Yu Xuan screamed.</p>

	<p>The faces of those watching changed. No one had believed that Split-Knife could be blocked.</p>

	<p>Pang!</p>

	<p>The Overbearing Shield displayed that word overbearing, sending the Split-Knife’s power back to its owner.
		Goddess’ wrists were broken, and her Split-Knife was sent flying out of her hands. She coughed up blood and
		found herself barreling through the air, too.</p>

	<p>Although she could use Split-Knife’s power, her body and self geno core weren’t super yet. They could not
		withstand the backlash.</p>

	<p>Han Sen flapped his wings and the red light arced across the sky. Taia came forward like a wild wind, and Han Sen
		cut Goddess in half while she was still airborne.</p>

	<p>She was the favorite daughter of Sacred Shelter’s leader. Even if Yu Miao or Little Lion King possessed Han Sen’s
		power, they would never have dared to do this.</p>

	<p>Now Han Sen had just killed her mercilessly, and they all froze. Yu Miao, who wanted to take advantage of the
		situation, was left in shock. This was beyond all her expectations, and she didn’t dare make a move.</p>

	<p>Han Sen frowned. He had killed Goddess, but he did not hear an announcement. The two halves of her body faded
		into the God Ring, and then the God Ring disappeared.</p>

	<p>“I will kill you!” The angry voice of Goddess echoed through the air.</p>
