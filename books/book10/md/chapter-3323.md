Space Garden was saved, but they had only managed to keep the area around the base. It was unknown how many Break World beasts were out there hiding in the forest. They were combining with the life souls. The longer time went by, the more their Break World rate increased.

Han Sen left the base area. He held a Break World gene in his hands. This Break World gene had come from Black King. He did not have the time to refine it.

He put the tear-shaped Break World gene in his mouth. He felt a weird power surge through his belly. His cells were changing fast.

“Break World gene plus nine.” The announcement played in Han Sen’s brain. Han Sen was happy about this. “I received nine Break World genes at once. It looks like it will not be difficult getting 100 to max it all out. I just need to kill 10 Break World beasts. With the amount of Break World beasts around in this universe, killing 10 Break World beasts will not be difficult. Space Garden itself should have at least more than 10 in the vicinity.”

Han Sen was set on leaving the base. He was determined to find more Break World beasts around Space Garden. He wanted to max out his Break World genes and get his Break World gene tally to a hundred. He wanted to see what sort of changes his body would develop.

The Break World genes were very weird. Although his Break World gene amount had increased, the Break World rate of his four geno arts did not increase. His Super God Spirit mode, however, did seem to be affected. His spirit body underwent some changes. Because his pure spirit body could not touch or manipulate anything, Han Sen could not be certain if it was a good thing or a bad thing.

Boom! Boom! Big booming sounds were coming from the nearby forest. It was like thunder heard from afar. The noise lasted a long time.

Han Sen’s heart jumped, and he teleported. He went to where the sound was coming from. He saw a white tiger with four wings lying in blood. Its body was full of sword holes. It was like it had been perforated by 10,000 knives and died. It kept bleeding without reprieve.

A man with green feathers was above the four-winged tiger. It was Ning Yue.

Amidst the chaos of the Break World beast rampage earlier, Han Sen had seen this four-winged white tiger. Its Break World rate was not very high, but it was very fast. It was a wind element Break World beast.

In that fight, it had not been killed. It was repelled.

Now, Ning Yue was killing it. The task seemed to be easy for him to accomplish.

“Ning Yue, you have finally managed to conquer the little green sword. Allow me to congratulate you.” Han Sen walked over to Ning Yue.

Ning Yue descended from space and approached Han Sen. He stopped one foot away from Han Sen. His eyes were calm and like a deep well. He peered at Han Sen. “I am back. The fight between you and me should begin now.”

“Can we not fight?” Han Sen shrugged his shoulders and replied, “You know I’m a pacifist now, don’t you?”

Ning Yue curled his lips. He strangely looked at him. He stumbled backward and looked at Han Sen. “Your unsettled heart did not tell me that.”

“Things are different now,” Han Sen said. “Space Garden needs me and you as well.”

“I have been waiting for this day for too long.” Ning Yue’s face looked smaller. He stared at Han Sen and calmly said, “I want to know how far I have come and how far you have come.”

Han Sen looked at Ning Yue and asked, “Must we fight?”

“It is not that I have to,” Ning Yue said. “It is just the fact I have been waiting for this for so long. At least give me a reason to keep waiting.”

“The geno tablet above the 33 skies,” Han Sen said. “Right now, the whole universe of creatures wants to fight to become its master. Why don’t you and I use the geno tablet for a bet? How about we see which one of us can become its master?”

Ning Yue stared at the 33 skies and the headstone. He peered at the geno tablet. He nodded and said, “That can work too.”

After that, Ning Yue turned around and readied himself to leave.

Han Sen stared at Ning Yue’s back and asked, “Ning Yue, do you have a Break World gene?”

Ning Yue stopped in his tracks, but he did not turn around as he replied, “Yes, I have got it.”

“What is the use of a Break World gene?” Han Sen asked.

“You have the Break World gene, too, don’t you? Don’t you know what it is for?” Ning Yue paused and said, “The Break World gene increased the strength of my Super God Spirit body.”

“I see. I wasn’t sure. I did not know if it was just me. It did not improve the prowess of my geno arts.” Han Sen was able to confirm his line of thinking.

“I do not know about others, but the Break World genes only seemed to work on my Super God Spirit body. They do not work on my geno arts,” Ning Yue said. He then flashed away and went deep into the forests.

Clearly, he had a hankering to slay Break World beasts as well. He wanted to increase his Break World genes like Han Sen. Ning Yue was not in a rush to visit the 33 skies.

Han Sen did not go too deep into the forest. He took the four-winged white tiger’s body back to Space Garden. Although the Break World gene of the four-winged white tiger had been taken by Ning Yue, its body would benefit humans and creatures.

After all, Space Garden did not have many Break World elites. Its body would prove useful.

“Right now, the Break World beasts of the universe are everywhere. If Ning Yue is in Space Garden, I will go to Sky Palace.” Before Han Sen left, he gave the black king beast soul and light king dragon’s beast soul to Ji Yanran so she could protect herself.

The light god dragon beast soul was the stream light dragon spear. The black king beast soul was an armor beast soul. It created a black jade set of armor. Its Break World rate was 59%. It only needed one more percent to reach 60%.

One was also able to improve the element. The stream god light spear did not have an element. Han Sen did not know how to increase the black king armor.

“Han Sen, I feel so restless lately. I feel as if something bad is going to happen.” While Han Sen was leaving, Ji Yanran pulled him closer. This was the first time Ji Yanran had stopped Han Sen from going.

“Do not worry. I am only going to Sky Palace to have a look. I am not going to the 33 skies. I will be fine.” Han Sen held Ji Yanran’s face and smiled.

“Hopefully, it is just me that is overthinking things. My Xuan is not the best it can be yet. Maybe it just isn’t accurate enough.” Ji Yanran forced a smile. She looked as if she was in a bad mood.

After thinking for a moment, Han Sen suggested, “How about this? I will go to Mister White and have him calculate things. If things are predicted to be bad, I will not go.”

Ji Yanran felt a bit safer after hearing that. She nodded and said, “That would be for the best. You should go and see Mister White.”

“Wait a while. I will be back soon.” Han Sen rubbed her cheeks and left the garden. He went to see Mister White.

“Big bad luck!” Before Han Sen could even say anything, Mister White said those three words to him the moment he saw him.
