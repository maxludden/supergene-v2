<p>On the cold planet, a man and a woman traversed a snow area. The
man was holding a little baby wearing fur.</p>
<p>Ancient Origin God had made a space element Ancient God teleport
to help Han Sen, Dragon Lady, and the ancient spirit seed get to
the planet. It saved Han Sen a lot of trouble. Han Sen thought it
would not be difficult to find someone on the icy planet. When he
reached it, he realized it would not be easy.</p>
<p>Although the cold planet was a planet with life, the environment
made it a harsh place to live. The temperature of the planet was
very low. Many cold-element xenogeneic creatures were living there.
The only beings with high intelligence were a race of creatures
called Snowmen. The Snowmen were not xenogeneics. Their technology
had yet to reach what was expected of those living in the
interstellar era. Even the evolution of their bodies was capped by
the planet’s level. They were very far behind.</p>
<p>The only thing Han Sen discovered was that the Snowmen had
villages and a language of their own. They did not know how to
speak the common tongue of the universe, so it made communication
with them difficult.</p>
<p>Han Sen and the others visited a dozen Snowmen villages, but
they were unable to gather any news about Han Yufei being there.
“Is Han Yufei really on the cold planet?” Han Sen was starting to
wonder whether or not Han Jinzhi had spoken the truth or not. He
had frequently been called the greatest liar, so it would be no
surprise if this was just another fib.</p>
<p>Han Sen was most depressed about his inability to make use of
his Dongxuan Aura. Otherwise, he could have used it to scan the
entire planet. If Han Yufei was really there, she would have been
easy to find.</p>
<p>Han Sen was thinking about whether or not he should use his
Super God Spirit mode to use Dongxuan Aura for scanning the entire
planet when Dragon Lady suddenly asked, “What is this?”</p>
<p>Han Sen followed Dragon Lady’s direction. There was a snowy
mountain in the ice fields.</p>
<p>Seeing a snowy mountain was not weird. What was weird about it
was that the snowy mountain looked like a giant steam bun sitting
on the ice. It looked large and strange.</p>
<p>The cold planet had ice and snowy mountains everywhere, but
there were no circular ones. The texture of the ice and snow could
not have made an ice mountain or snow mountain that was
half-circular.</p>
<p>“Let’s go and take a look.” Han Sen’s body moved fast. He was
like a bolt of lightning going straight for the half-circular snow
mountain.</p>
<p>Han Sen soon noticed that it was not a mountain. It was a
half-circular building covered with heavy snow. There was no snow
near the entrance. “I cannot believe there is a high-tech building
here. Even if this is not where Han Yufei is, we will likely find a
lead or two about her there.” Han Sen looked at the curved metal
door. He knew the Snowmen could not have constructed that
building</p>
<p>Dragon Lady followed him. The two of them looked at the
building. The metal door opened, allowing Han Sen to see what was
inside the building.</p>
<p>“Does ice compose most of this building’s construction?” Han Sen
noticed that the building was full of semi-transparent ice. No
matter if it was a table or platform, it was all made of ice. Only
the tools and high-tech stuff was made of metal.</p>
<p>“Welcome to Zero Laboratory.” A very old robot walked out to
meet them. Its head was like a big half-circular lightbulb. It
looked like a police siren. It flickered with red and blue lights.
It was headed toward the gate.</p>
<p>When Han Sen and Dragon Lady saw the robot, they wanted to say
something. Their expressions swiftly changed. The robot’s head
shone a light on them. It quickly froze their bodies and turned
them into ice cubes.</p>
<p>“I found three test subjects. This is great! Master will be so
happy. Ha! Ha! Ha!” The robot used a voice that sounded electric,
but it did not sound like a robot.</p>
<p>Pang!</p>
<p>The robot was going to take the frozen Han Sen and others away
when the cold Dragon Lady’s body suddenly flickered with light. She
broke out of the ice that encased her and raised her hands. A giant
knife and fork appeared in them.</p>
<p>“Even though you are a robot, you must still be able to
understand food. Dragon Eater’s eight skills Knife and Fork Dance.”
Dragon Lady sounded calm, but the knife in her hand was like a
storm as it attacked the robot.</p>
<p>Noises of metal clashing sounded everywhere. The robot was
captured by the fork. When the knife and fork danced about, he was
chopped into pieces. He turned into broken copper cast all over the
floor.</p>
<p>An icy snow-like fairy came flying out of the light coming from
the robot’s head. It flapped its little wings and dodged Dragon
Lady’s knife and fork storm like a ghost. It quickly flew deeper
into the building. Now, Han Sen knew the robot was just a disguise.
The snow-like fairy xenogeneic was its true self.</p>
<p>“Do you want to escape? Not so fast!” Dragon Lady looked cold as
she shouted. “Dragon Eater’s eighth skill, Barbecue Pork!”</p>
<p>Dragon Lady’s fork went flying. It went straight for the fleeing
snow fairy. The fork trapped it, making it unable to move.</p>
<p>Dragon Lady moved the fork, and the snow fairy’s body flew back
through the air.</p>
<p>In the next second, Dragon Lady’s knife arose with a storm of
fire. She was going to cook that snow fairy straight away.</p>
<p>The snow fairy struggled and screamed, “Master, help me!”</p>
<p>Seeing the fire was going to touch the snow fairy, a cold light
suddenly flashed. The shadow of the fork was broken by the cold
light. The snow fairy was set free. It flapped its wings and flew
away. She dodged the dangerous flame that sought to cook her.</p>
<p>Deeper into the hall of the laboratory, a woman was wearing a
white lab coat, short skirt, stockings, and high heels. She had
short hair and wore a pair of black-framed glasses. She had a
scalpel in her hands. The cold light came from the scalpel.</p>
<p>The snow fairy raced to the woman. It flew around her, saying,
“Master, they broke into the lab and wanted to kill me! Capture
them and make them a test subject.”</p>
<p>The woman’s vision was snared by Dragon Lady’s gaze. It looked
like there were sparks between them. The woman coldly said, “I
thought someone dared to trouble me here in my lab, but it was just
a mixed Ancient God. I suppose that is perfect for a test subject.
She will come in handy.”</p>
<p>When Dragon Lady heard that, her face turned sour. She held the
knife and fork and raised her eyebrows. “Before that, you will
become food on my plate.”</p>
<p>The two women stared at each other. The knife, fork, and scalpel
all shone. It was so scary. The levels of their powers continued to
amp.</p>
<p>“Stop it! We are all friends here. We should talk about this.
This was all just a big misunderstanding.” Han Sen broke the ice
and stepped forward. He ran between the women and stopped them from
fighting.</p>
<p>The two women spoke the same words at the same time. “Who says I
am friends with her?”</p>
<p>After that, the woman saw Han Sen and looked at him with shock.
“It’s you! Why are you here?”</p>
<p>“Han Jinzhi sent me to find you. He said only you can sort out
my blue blood problem.” Han Sen did not cut corners. “Han Jinzhi?
Who is that?” Han Yufei looked confused.</p>
