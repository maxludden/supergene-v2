  The Feather students that lived on Cloud Island were busy preparing the knife event.

“Angia, do you think Han Sen will come?” asked a Feather lady called An Lingxin.

Before Angia replied, a strong Feather named Andrew said, “I think he is afraid of Angia. That is why he hasn’t appeared. I bet you he won’t come. Hearing what he did in Sky Palace, I thought he was strong. I didn’t expect he’d be so much of a pussy that he wouldn’t even show up. Ha, and people call him the Knife and Sword Master!”

Angia stared at Andrew and said, “Shut up! When are you going to stop being an idiot and watch your words? The Knife and Sword Master includes Lone Bamboo. What if the Sky heard what you just said?”

“Sorry,” Andrew apologized.

Angia shook his head. Andrew had always been like that, so changing him was difficult.

After a brief moment of silence, Angia said, “It is fine if Han Sen does not come. People will just think he is afraid of us, and that still contributes to our cause.”

An Lingxin was worried, though. “We have been here for so long, and we have heard many stories about Han Sen. The people here respect him, and they say he is so strong.”

“So what? Angia will win.” Andrew was very confident in Angia’s abilities.

Angia touched An Lingxin’s head. “Don’t worry. I have experienced rebirth, and I have practiced Heaven Feather and Judgment Knife. With all this, I will not be weak. And even if I do lose, with Han Sen’s reputation, it would still count as a win just to fight with him. Just like him fighting Lone Bamboo. If he hadn’t fought Lone Bamboo, he wouldn’t have earned the reputation he currently possesses. We need a chance like this. If he comes and fights me, it will count as a win no matter what.”

After that, Angia smiled. “Go and prepare. The guests will soon arrive. Whether Han Sen comes or not, we need this to look good.”

Yun Sushang and Yun Suyi soon arrived at Cloud Island. There were a number of familiar faces there, like Thousand Feather Crane.

“Brother Crane!” Yun Sushang towed Yun Suyi over to sit next to him.

“Do you guys know where Han Sen is? Will he come to this knife event?” Thousand Feather Crane asked the two, but he was looking at Yun Suyi.

Yun Suyi answered, “Han Sen went to Xuanyuan Cave. He hasn’t come back yet. He cannot participate in the knife event.”

“It would be best if he didn’t come.” Thousand Feather Crane nodded.

“Why?” Yun Suyi did not understand.

Thousand Feather Crane lowered his head and said, “With Han Sen’s reputation, Angia is the only one who would benefit if they fought. It wouldn’t matter if he won or lost. There is no need to help their kind.”

Yun Suyi was not stupid. She understood what Thousand Feather Crane meant, and so she nodded.

There were many Sky Palace students arriving. The highest of them were Earl class. The Feathers hadn’t been here for very long, so they were lucky to have that many people attend.

Most people were there to see the Blood Feather Knife.

The Blood Feather Knife was something that a Feather Alpha used a deified feather to forge. It was a treasure of the Feathers, but even most of them never saw it. For outsiders, the chances were even less.

For Angia to bring the Blood Feather Knife here was surprising. Many elders wished to see it, so they sent their students to take a look on their behalf.

Angia had prepared a speech for the beginning of the knife event. The Feathers were very beautiful, and Angia was a good speaker. The atmosphere was pleasant.

Angia did not waste time talking about pointless things, and he presented the Blood Feather Knife quickly.

Everyone focused on the rectangle box.

Angia said quietly, “The Blood Feather Knife has existed for thousands of centuries. We have yet to find a scabbard worthy of it, so we have kept it stored inside this box. I must apologize for this.”

After this, Angia gently opened the case. Yun Suyi and the others stared at the box. In it, there was a three-foot-long white feather-shaped weapon.

There was a blood marking on the white feather blade. It made a startling contrast with the white body.

Angia explained, “This blade was created by our Alpha using a deified feather. When it was created, a deified xenogeneic wanted it. Our Alpha used the knife, which was not yet completed, to heavily damage the xenogeneic. That deified xenogeneic escaped, but the feather knife absorbed the xenogeneic’s blood. That is why there is a mark. It led to the Alpha naming it Blood Feather Knife.”

Excitement moved through the audience. They wished to hold the Blood Feather Knife to determine for themselves if the knife was real or fake.

Angia knew people wanted to see it, too. So, he took it out of the box and handed it to the nearest student, so they could pass it along.

Thousand Feather Crane, Yun Sushang, and Yun Suyi looked over the Blood Feather Knife and came to the conclusion that it was a good knife.

But there was a rumor that said the knife was a deified weapon, despite it not looking like one.

People passed along the Blood Feather Knife, all complimenting it. When it was handed back to Angia, an Earl class student asked, “If this is a deified weapon, why doesn’t it reveal its power?”

Angia smiled and said, “You have remarkable eyesight. Others will tell you it is a deified weapon, and with the material it was created with, it should be one. But the story I have just told you, about striking the deified xenogeneic, kept that from happening. The xenogeneic blood that splashed across it was not too compatible with the knife, so it came to be a King class weapon instead. It is not a deified weapon; it is a King class weapon.”

“So that is why.” People felt it was a great shame.

King class weapons were strong, but they weren’t deified weapons.

“Today, I have asked you to come here in the hopes of finding a master for this knife. If anyone can beat me with knifeskills, they may own it.” After Angia said that, people became excited.
