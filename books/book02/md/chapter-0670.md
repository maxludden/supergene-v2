The man and the bear stared at each other for three seconds. Then, Wang Yuhang screamed, turned, and started running away. The giant white bear heaved itself out the water, and with the big fish still in its mouth, gave chase to the running man. It ignored Han Sen and Li Xinglun completely.

"That little uncle can really..." Li Xinglun was motionless as he watched the scene. Those words were the only few he could conjure.

Han Sen had already summoned his peacock crossbow and loaded it with seven raven bolts. Without delay, he was hot on the creature's heels.

Wang Yuhang continued to scream aloud as he ran, and in the midst of his frightened flight, managed to plead, "What are you guys doing? Help me! If you don't, I'll be the bear's next ice lolly."

The eight meter tall white bear occasionally jumped as it chased after Wang Yuhang, trying to pounce on him. Whenever it hopped, one foot thick paw-shaped craters were left behind in the ice that separated those on top and the freezing waters below. Shards and chips of ice were cast about ten meters after each paw returned to the pulverized ice.

The chips of ice pelleted Wang Yuhang a few times, which caused him to shiver. His face was drawn of color and a white, frosty webbing formed on his skin.

His situation looked dire, and you could see his joints stiffen and slow as he went on.

With Wang Yuhang getting dangerously close to being pummeled by the wrathful bear, Han Sen could wait no longer. Although he could not aim at the bear's weak spot, he fired a bolt at it to aid Wang Yuhang.

The bolt feather traveled forty meters and struck the bear's leg. The tip of the bolt managed to get lodged inside, which surprised Han Sen.

He had already assumed the pelt and hide of the bear was really thick, and despite firing the bolt to just strike anywhere, the fact that the bolt managed to pierce the creature was a testament to the crossbow's new strength. Its evolution was a worthy investment, and it was most certainly capable of slaying super creatures.

But in the grand scheme of things, such small feathers were pointless when not fired towards a super creature's weak spot. The frosty bear roared, scratched off the bolt in its leg, and snapped it.

Han Sen's heart died a little, when he watched the bear do that. It meant that he only had six bolts left.

The frosty bear forsook its pursuit of Wang Yuhang and turned its attention to Han Sen. Its eyes were full of anger, and it desired nothing more than to brutally murder the person who had just dealt it minor harm.

Han Sen then summoned his Flaming Rex Spike. As the bear leapt towards him, he cast his Toxic-Dragon Drill. The two meter long sharp weapon spun like a tornado and drilled into the bear's chest.

Roar!

The hide of its front chest was torn open by the ravenous rex spike. Although the wound wasn't too deep, blood was drawn by the whirling blade. The flames singed the fur, too, lighting the borders of the wound like a ring of fire.

This result made Han Sen's heart so happy. He felt confident in pushing even further, driving the weapon in deeper. The frosty bear's paws, however, slapped the Flaming Rex Spike.

Dong!

Han Sen felt a great force of strength hit his rex spike, which made it tremble. The force built up until Han Sen's hands went soft, and the Flaming Rex Spike was knocked out his hands and sent flying for a good distance. On its descent, it crashed into the ice and slid into the murky depths of the sea below.

Han Sen's hand was bleeding, laden with cuts. The brute power of the frosty bear was too much.

Li Xinglun fired a few arrows towards the bear with a bow of his own. Its purpose was suppressive fire, which would allow Han Sen to fall back and recover. Han Sen summoned the Flaming Rex Spike back but decided not to target the bear head-on again, face-to-face. With his weapon in hand, he focused on dodging the bear's repeated attacks, waiting for the perfect opening.

The frosty bear then rattled its body to shoot out a number of sharp shards of ice. The fire that scorched the bear's chest was then extinguished, as a white, icy fog masked the surrounding area.

Fortunately, after Han Sen unlocked his gene lock with Jadeskin, he had built up a tremendous resistance to the icy elements â€“ his movement was not restricted in any capacity.

The giant frosty bear was, on average, slower than most super creatures. Still, Han Sen had to use everything he had to stay out of the way of the bear's paw strikes.

But the situation became grimmer and grimmer as time went on, and he believed himself to have underestimated how powerful super creatures really were. Adult super creatures had a fitness level of around three hundred, on average.

Han Sen's fitness level was one hundred seventy. With all the hyper geno arts he had learnt, the most power he could muster was equivalent to a fitness level of two hundred. He was still far weaker than the super creatures he was anxious to hunt.

Especially in terms of raw power. The frosty bear's power was far stronger than Han Sen's, but its lower-than-average speed was the boon he needed. Its speed provided Han Sen the perfect opportunity to fight back.

Li Xinglun opened his gene lock and fired a few more arrows toward the frosty bear. One of the sacred-blood arrows he fired hit the bear's ear, which enraged the creature. The bear then changed its target again, opting to pursue Li Xinglun.

Li Xinglun's movement was quite good. He may have lacked the mobility and precise agility Han Sen possessed, but Li Xinglun's speed was top-notch when going in a relatively straight line. This was what Li Xinglun now tried to do. Unfortunately, the frosty bear was not entirely outpaced, and it managed to remain quite close in its chase.

Wang Yuhang's body was finally starting to get better. He quickly grabbed some ice and threw it at the bear to draw its attention back to himself again.

The frosty bear then abandoned its hunt of Li Xinglun and resumed its pursuit of Wang Yuhang.

Han Sen's bolt hit the frosty bear's neck, but this time, it did not turn around and switch targets again. It remained fixated on its chase of Wang Yuhang. It kept chasing him, ignoring the others.

"Oh heavens, I may not survive much longer! Somebody, I beseech your aid to save me from a wretched demise!" Wang Yuhang slipped and fell. With only a second to spare, he managed to dodge the bear's next attack. He was in danger, and he could succumb to the creature's next, fatal strike any second now. His body was also accumulating further layers of frost, as his hair and eyebrows appeared to be painted white. Death was not far off for Wang Yuhang.

"Run to me!" Han Sen yelled to Wang Yuhang. Han Sen was holding the peacock crossbow, with his finger on the trigger. Arm raised, he took aim at the bear and remained motionless.

Wang Yuhang pulled himself up and ran towards Han Sen, screaming for him to fire the bolt.

But Han Sen did not move an inch as he waited for Wang Yuhang to draw even closer. The bear came after him, unceasing, with its filthy maw wide open. Its tongue was lax out of its mouth, and it occasionally tried to lick up Wang Yuhang.

Fortunately, Wang Yuhang was a powerful man. Even when he suffered from the frostbite that he had incurred, he still managed to stumble to where he was told to be and outpace the bear.

Li Xinglun continued to fire arrows from a distance, trying his best to ease the pressure and relieve Wang Yuhang from the pursuit of his would-be killer.

His eyes shone like starlight. He possessed a strange power, as each arrow was fired with impeccable aim. They may not have dealt any damage, but he had managed to strike the bear's eyes a few times, too, to buy Wang Yuhang as much time as he could.

Wang Yuhang had finally reached Han Sen's position when he ducked and rolled along the ice to dodge one last attack.

Han Sen was facing the frosty bear that was now only one meter away. He pulled the trigger and fired at the beast with a rapid pace.

All of the bolts were fired consecutively, each one set on an airborne voyage to intercept the rampaging bear.
