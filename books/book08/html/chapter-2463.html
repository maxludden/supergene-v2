<h3>Chapter 2463</h3>

<p>“This is really the place.” The dragon was too big to land on
the island, so it circled overhead. The Extreme King man stood atop
the head of the dragon, peering down at the island.</p>
<p>Han Sen was shocked, and he thought to himself, “The Extreme
King have gotten here so quickly?”</p>
<p>Han Sen didn’t recognize this Extreme King man, but he
immediately identified the giant dragon beneath the man’s feet. Han
Sen had never seen it before, but he knew its name. It was the
famous Extreme Purple Demon Dragon. It was deified, and it was a
mount for the king’s brother Meng Lie.</p>
<p>Meng Lie was King Bai’s biological brother, and he had become
deified a long time ago. He was one of the top ten elites of the
Extreme King.</p>
<p>If even the likes of Meng Lie had come to the Tianxia System to
hunt down Han Sen, that showed just how much they wanted him
dead.</p>
<p>But Han Sen couldn’t blame the Extreme King. The king’s son had
been murdered. If Han Sen didn’t pay for what he had done, then the
dignity and pride of the Extreme King and King Bai would be forever
tarnished.</p>
<p>“Han Sen! I know you are here. Do you want to come out by your
own volition, or do you want me to come down there and drag you
out?” Meng Lie boomed from the air, staring down at the wooden
house.</p>
<p>Han Sen’s heart began to pound. He knew the Extreme King would
come after he sent the video, but he hadn’t thought they would
arrive so quickly.</p>
<p>Han Sen had expected the demon spirit to be nearby when the
Extreme King arrived, so they would have to deal with him before
they could focus on Han Sen. But in a surprising turn of events,
the demon spirit had yet to appear.</p>
<p>“Two deifieds have come looking for you. It seems as if you’re
in over your head.” The woman looked at Han Sen with interest.</p>
<p>Before Han Sen could answer, the Extreme Purple Demon Dragon
beneath Meng Lie gathered up a sphere of dragon power. It turned
itself into a being of purple fire. It was going to smite the
island and turn it to ash.</p>
<p>The woman’s face hardened, and the light of the red lantern she
was holding grew brighter. The red light covered the whole island,
intercepting the purple fireball. The dragon’s attack was unable to
penetrate the light.</p>
<p>The purple fire burned fiercely and the red light wavered, but
it still managed to shield the island from the power of the fire.
The purple fire was incredibly wild, but it couldn’t make it past
the shield.</p>
<p>The Extreme Purple Demon Dragon became incredibly angry. It spat
out more of that purple fire, but try as it might, it couldn’t
displace the red light.</p>
<p>The woman was unshaken. She raised her lantern and put her hand
inside it. When she pulled her hand back out of it, Han Sen saw
there was a little flame flickering atop her fingers.</p>
<p>The woman flicked it at the Extreme Purple Demon Dragon that
hovered in the sky. That small flame shot upward, rising until it
hit the dragon.</p>
<p>Boom!</p>
<p>Han Sen watched what looked like a nuclear bomb going off. The
giant body of the Extreme Purple Demon Dragon was engulfed by a
bright red sea of fire. The monster was transformed into a big,
burning fireball. It squealed in pain, and its wings flapped madly
as it tried to put out the fire that was ravaging it.</p>
<p>But the more it flapped, the more the fire burned.</p>
<p>Han Sen was frozen. As a fire-aligned deified xenogeneic, the
Extreme Purple Demon Dragon should have been able to eat fire for
breakfast. Instead, it was burning in intense pain. It was
difficult to imagine how terrifying that tiny flame must have
been.</p>
<p>The woman stood as calmly as if nothing spectacular had
happened. She continued to hold the big red lantern, and she stood
in front of the window, looking up at the Extreme Purple Demon
Dragon and Meng Lie.</p>
<p>Suddenly, Han Sen saw Meng Lie roll up his sleeves. Then it was
like the man turned into a black hole. The red fire on the Extreme
Purple Demon Dragon was sucked into that black hole, and it all
disappeared. There wasn’t even a whiff of smoke remaining.</p>
<p>“Meng Lie is very powerful,” Han Sen thought to himself.</p>
<p>“Who are you? Why are you protecting a fugitive like Han Sen?”
Meng Lie stood atop the head of the Extreme Purple Demon Dragon’s
head, looking down at the woman near the window. He frowned.</p>
<p>“This is my house,” the woman said simply. “You cannot just come
here and attempt to burn it down, killing as you please.”</p>
<p>Meng Lie looked at the woman in the same way. “Han Sen has a
deep grudge with the Extreme King. The Extreme King will make him
pay with his blood. If you would grant me access to your abode, we
will greatly appreciate it.”</p>
<p>“And what if I don’t?” The woman wasn’t pleased by Meng Lie’s
tone.</p>
<p>Meng Lie had asked her to stay out of the way, but it had
sounded more like a command. There was no room for maneuvering or
negotiation.</p>
<p>“Then I will forge my own path. The Extreme King are here now,
and no one can stop me,” Meng Lie said imperiously.</p>
<p>Hearing Meng Lie say that, Han Sen almost burst out
laughing.</p>
<p>The Extreme King had enough power to suppress many races. And
all of the top ten deifieds of the Extreme King were a serious
threat.</p>
<p>But Meng Lie had just condescended to the wrong person. This
woman had come from the era of the Sacred Leader. The Extreme
King’s alpha had been merely a servant to a woman like this, once
upon a time. And now, an heir of the Extreme King was talking down
to her in such a manner. Han Sen knew what she was going to do,
just judging from the man’s disrespectful tone of voice.</p>
<p>“The Extreme King must be really powerful. I am keen to see how
you, a scion of the Extreme King, will build a path that cuts right
through me,” the woman said, her voice dripping with contempt.</p>
<p>Meng Lie frowned. The Extreme King were one of the most famous
races in the universe, and they had been for a very long time.
Furthermore, Meng Lie was the brother of the king. Aside from those
of the Very High or the Ancient God, no one ever dared to speak to
them in such a way.</p>
<p>“Hmph.” Meng Lie flipped his hands out and started to push
toward the island.</p>
<p>The hand became a big print that suddenly covered the whole
shield. A hellish godlight burned from the print. It turned into an
old word that read “king,” and it was infused with powers for
crushing the sky and the ground.</p>
<p>The clouds of the Tianxia System shook because of that word. The
clouds nearby were all rolling, and space was tearing and coming
undone under the force of the large print. The whole area had
become a dangerous maelstrom of destructive power.</p>
<p>In Han Sen’s eyes, it was like the whole world was being
flattened by that unstoppable word. The island was going to get
crushed like an egg.</p>
<p>“You stole the World Print, and now you have the gall to show it
off here?” The woman looked up with disdain. She raised her hands,
and a small print appeared on her fingers. She threw it at the big
print that was coming down toward the island.</p>
<p>The small print and the big print collided. Weird symbols
flashed across the smaller print. Han Sen couldn’t tell what the
symbols meant, but the sight of them was disconcerting. It was like
the universe’s destiny now resided in that little print.</p>
<p>Boom!</p>
<p>The small print hit the big print. Then, the scary big print
shattered. It couldn’t repel the small print.</p>
<p>“How is that possible?” Meng Lie’s face changed. His king print
could suppress the sky and earth, and no race should have been able
to stop it. But now, a much smaller print had been able to crush
it. It was a sight that beggared belief.</p>
<p>Han Sen had used his Purple-Eye Butterfly to observe the
conflict. The woman’s small print had a similar structure to the
big print, but the smaller variant’s power was much denser.</p>
<p>They looked roughly the same, but when they ran into each other,
but it was like refined steel going up against baked clay. The
world shocking king print shattered. It couldn’t compare to the
woman’s World Print.</p>
