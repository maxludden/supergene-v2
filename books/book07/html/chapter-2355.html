<p>Han Sen floated down until his feet rested on the surface of the
water. He had no plans to escape. He looked at Nine-Headed Bird and
said, “I will remain standing here. You can use whatever sort of
power you wish, and if my feet cause any ripples in the water, then
I forfeit and lose.”</p>
<p>When Nine-Headed Bird heard Han Sen’s declaration, he drifted
down to the sea’s surface as well. His bird-with-nine-heads
appearance returned to something human-like again. He smiled and
said, “As I should have expected from a prince of the Extreme King:
you are true to your word.”</p>
<p>“I don’t know if you Pirates are trustworthy, but the Extreme
King are,” Han Sen coldly said.</p>
<p>Nine-Headed Bird smiled and said, “There is no need to try to
provoke me. If you keep your end of the bargain, I will not break
the rules.”</p>
<p>“Good. You strike first.” Han Sen stood atop the sea,
unmoving.</p>
<p>“Sure, I’ll strike first,” Nine-Headed Bird said, but he
continued looking at Han Sen without attacking.</p>
<p>Nine-Headed Bird was certain that he could defeat Han Sen as
long as the Kingese were not a factor. Making Han Sen move would be
easy.</p>
<p>But Han Sen was a prince of the Extreme King, so Nine-Headed
Bird knew better than to attack carelessly. He considered the best
way to move Han Sen from his spot.</p>
<p>“What? You still haven’t attacked. Is a half-deified being
terrified of me?” Han Sen laughed.</p>
<p>Nine-Headed Bird lifted his lips in a sneer. “Didn’t I tell you?
Trying to provoke me won’t work.”</p>
<p>After that, Nine-Headed Bird looked at Han Sen and thought to
himself, “His Original Water King Body cannot be destroyed. Even if
I completely wreck his upper body, his legs might remain untouched.
No matter how powerful my hit is, it’s not guaranteed that I can
move his feet.”</p>
<p>Thinking of that, Nine-Headed Bird had an idea. He prepared to
strike.</p>
<p>“Hang on.” Han Sen suddenly raised his hand to stop the man.</p>
<p>“What? Are you regretting our agreement?” Nine-Headed Bird
stared at Han Sen.</p>
<p>Han Sen laughed. “I have nothing to regret, but before you
strike, we should discuss our deal.”</p>
<p>“What game are you trying to play now? We already established
the terms of our bargain; you give me the Ancient God Origin if you
lose. It’s that simple.” Nine-Headed Bird frowned.</p>
<p>“I will relinquish the Ancient God Origin if I lose, but what if
you lose? If we don’t sort out that aspect of the bargain, you
might keep trying to take my Ancient God Origin after you lose. I
have no protection here,” Han Sen said.</p>
<p>“If I lose, I won’t try to take the Ancient God Origin again.
Even if you threw it on the ground before me, I wouldn’t dare to
pick it up,” Nine-Headed Bird said.</p>
<p>“Awesome. Come on, then.” Han Sen activated his Original Water
King Body, and his entire body became translucent. He stood atop
the sea as if he was connected to it.</p>
<p>“So you were planning to use the Original Water King Body to
win. That was a poor choice.” Nine-Headed Bird coldly hummed. He
raised his hand, and a black demonic air gathered in front of his
fist. It formed a ceaselessly swirling black hole.</p>
<p>Bzzt!</p>
<p>Nine-Headed Bird punched toward Han Sen, and space itself
trembled around his fist. The black hole moved directly toward Han
Sen, and its frightening power tugged on everything around it.</p>
<p>Han Sen was still some distance from the black hole, but it was
already pulling at him. His water body shook, as if the water of
his form could break away and be sucked into the black hole at any
time.</p>
<p>Nine-Headed Bird’s attack didn’t strike Han Sen’s body directly.
Rather than being intended as a destructive attack, it was meant to
affect Han Sen’s balance. Its magnetic force would keep pulling
until Han Sen’s body was sucked inside.</p>
<p>Because Nine-Headed Bird had greater power, Han Sen’s body would
be drawn in by the black hole. There was no way he could lose.</p>
<p>Han Sen barely seemed to notice the black hole, though. He
remained motionless atop the water. He was not moving into the
black hole.</p>
<p>Nine-Headed Bird frowned. His attack was better than any Han Sen
could unleash without using his Kingese power. He should have been
falling into the black hole.</p>
<p>But Han Sen wasn’t moving. He wasn’t using the Kingese or some
sort of xenogeneic treasure, either. Nine-Headed Bird stared at Han
Sen in confusion.</p>
<p>Han Sen laughed. He had suggested this bet because he knew he
would win. He wouldn’t take this risk on a whim.</p>
<p>Nine-Headed Bird couldn’t see anything strange about Han Sen’s
stance, but Han Sen still could have used some sort of trick
without his knowledge.</p>
<p>Han Sen had suggested this bet because he had the Silver-Winged
Dragon beast soul.</p>
<div class="tables">
<table class="beast">
<tr>
<th colspan="2">Beast Soul Gained</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>King Class Silver-Winged Dragon</td>
<td>(Area)</td>
</tr>
</table>
<!-- King class xenogeneic beast soul Silver-Winged Dragon: area type --></div>
<p>Han Sen didn’t know if only King class beast souls had an
area-of-effect, but at that moment, it was the only area beast soul
that he had.</p>
<p>The Silver-Winged Dragon could deploy a water area, but it was
different from Bai Yi’s natural water area. This water area was
called the dragon area. The sea dragon had the soul of the sea, so
if Han Sen used the dragon area in the water, he could become a
part of the sea. His body melded with the sea itself.</p>
<p>Han Sen stood atop the sea, using the power of the sea to keep
him erect. Although he couldn’t control it with accuracy, he
couldn’t be moved unless Nine-Headed Bird summoned enough power to
shift the entire sea.</p>
<p>A bar of iron might be easily moved, but if it was welded onto
an aircraft carrier, no amount of pulling could force it to
budge.</p>
<p>Of course, a stick couldn’t control an aircraft carrier. But
merely remaining stable was enough for Han Sen.</p>
<p>With the dragon area, standing atop the sea made Han Sen
effectively immortal. Nine-Headed Bird could do nothing to him.</p>
<p>Nine-Headed Bird kept increasing the strength of his black hole,
but he was unable to move Han Sen. His eyes began to widen.</p>
<p>Xius watched the contest, frozen in place. She had no idea how
Han Sen was pulling this off.</p>
<p>“Nine-Headed Bird, can you keep going?” Han Sen smiled.</p>
<p>Nine-Headed Bird grunted coldly. He dismissed his black hole,
then lowered his arms. He spoke to Han Sen, “Come. If you can move
me, then I lose. If I do not move, then I will attack again. We
will decide the victor then.”</p>
<p>“Then I will start,” Han Sen said, summoning his wings. He
flapped his wings and flew far away.</p>
<p>Nine-Headed Bird’s eyes bulged. Han Sen was about to disappear
from his vision. He was so mad that he turned into the nine-headed
demon bird again. He ran after Han Sen and angrily shouted,
“Disgusting Extreme King! Are you going to embarrass your father
like that? You lose!”</p>
<p>Han Sen stopped. He turned around and looked at Nine-Headed Bird
with a grin.</p>
<p>“What is this bullshit?” Nine-Headed Bird slid to a stop. His
face turned a sickly green as he realized he had just been
tricked.</p>
<p>He had lost because he chased after Han Sen. He had fallen for
the simplest of ploys.</p>
