Han Sen only noticed now that the helmet on the seat turtle statue had a circular, plate-sized slot in the top.

The Spiky Turtle King’s body landed atop the helmet. It withdrew its neck and limbs into its shell and dropped neatly into the slot. It was a perfect fit.

The Spiky Turtle King’s black diamond shell began to shine. Then, the entire statue started to shine with that same black light, too. The blue statue slowly turned black, and the turtle’s hammers transformed into black crystals. A lifeforce began to radiate from them.

Han Sen and the others were appropriately shocked. They had never seen anything like this before.

*Boom!*

The hammer-wielding turtle moved forward. With a single step, it made the floor of the entire pool shake. The power surged through the water around it, sweeping all the turtles backward.

“Such power! That exceeds even a King!” Long Yin was in shock.

Dragon Fifteen shook his head. “No, it is not above King class. It is around half-deified.”

Xius nodded and said, “It is not deified, but it is certainly greater than a basic King class. It is half-deified.”

As the three of them spoke, the dual-wielding turtle walked through the ruins. That giant palace was perfectly sized for the turtle. He walked toward the palace, smacking down buildings that happened to be in his way with his hammers.

Every swing released a frightening shockwave, crushing the blue rocks scattered about. He pushed all the stone and rubble aside, forming a path for himself.

He came to the front gate of the palace, approximately one mile away.

When he approached the palace and swung a hammer toward it, a dragon-like power suddenly shot out of the palace and collided with the shockwave.

The two powers crashed against each other, but no explosion was released. The two powers tangled together instead, forming a giant underwater tornado. Everything around them was sucked into it.

The turtles in the vicinity tried to swim away. Some of the slower Spiky Turtles were pulled into the tornado. They were crushed by its velocity within a second, and red streams began to circle within the vortex.

Pang!

The Turtle Statue swung one of its hammers. The power of its strike broke through the tornado, allowing some of the luckier Spiky Turtles to get away.

Han Sen immediately started swimming away, as that power was too frightening. It was far beyond a level he could be expected to fight.

Dragon Fifteen was of the same mind. Together, they all looked to escape. If they did not leave now, they might not be able to withstand the power that would be released as the fight continued. They could very well die there.

A strange door then opened within the palace. Han Sen was in the midst of swimming away, but he still turned to look back.

Through that doorway, a giant head appeared. It was the Dragon God that had eaten Han Sen.

Roar!

A Dragon roar came from its mouth. The shockwave shot forward with blinding speed, and Han Sen and Dragon Fifteen were too slow to evade it. The impact left blood trailing past their lips.

Now the fight began in earnest. As the two monsters fought, the simple shockwaves were enough to kill Han Sen and Dragon Fifteen.

There were more hammer-strike sounds, and Han Sen heard two more roars. And then, the world started to tremble again.

Han Sen did not have time to look at what might have happened. He swam quickly toward the surface.

Long Ying grabbed Dragon Fifteen and summoned her powers. Her dragon wings unfurled and then snapped downward with the force of a cannon, firing the two Dragons toward the surface. She completely ignored Han Sen and Xius.

Xius flapped her snake tail and used a holy light for a boost, which let her swim faster than any fish. She outran all the Spiky Turtles, even those that were of Duke class.

Han Sen did not slow down, either. He focused all his power and skill into swimming, and he was able to keep up with Xius.

Xius was shocked to see Han Sen maintaining pace with her. But now was not the time to watch Han Sen. She had to focus on reaching the surface.

*Boom!*

A giant shockwave was approaching. Han Sen moved fast, ducking into the refuge offered by a Duke turtle’s shell. And then, that power went right past him. It tore apart all the lesser turtles around. Their shells were ripped open like paper, and their gore dyed the water red.

The Duke class giant turtles were bounced ten meters forward.

Han Sen was knocked into a giant turtle. He quickly grabbed the cannon-like spikes and allowed the turtle to tow him back to the surface.

Xius was hit, too. But she was strong, and she survived the shockwave. She also reached the surface.

When they reached the surface, Dragon Fifteen quickly gathered Long Shan and the others onto a giant green leaf. Xius landed on another green leaf. They were leaving that island with all haste.

The turtles wanted to escape, too. Han Sen remained atop a turtle’s back, clutching its spike. The Duke class Spiky Turtles could run faster than he could.

*Boom!*

Before the turtles reached the shoreline, a noise began to rumble from the pool. The water in the pool swelled up like a pillar, rising a hundred meters into the sky.

And then, an angry beast appeared. It had blue scales, and it possessed the head of a dragon. Its body, however, was like a kirin’s. It was glowing blue. It wasn’t like a monster, overall; it was more like a holy beast.

Now Han Sen knew what the Dragon God really looked like. He did not know what sort of xenogeneic it could be, though.

The black crystal turtle followed it out, wielding two black hammers in its hands. The hammers tore apart space itself, and the turtle teleported in front of the Dragon God.

The Dragon God roared. Its blue presence struck the hammer with earthquake

force.

The power broke the mountains of the island, and Han Sen’s Spiky Turtle was sent rolling. Not long after, Han Sen and the turtle fell into the sea. Han Sen was still clutching the spike firmly.

The scary power flew wildly throughout Return Ruin Sea. Even underwater, Han Sen could feel the surges of power. Waves rose to heights of a hundred meters, and lots of water was vaporized.
