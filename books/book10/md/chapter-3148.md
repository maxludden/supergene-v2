  Sky King saw Han Sen and the others return from their venture safe and sound. He wasn’t too surprised. He laughed and asked, “Brother Han and Bao’er, what are the fruits of your labors like this time?”

Han Sen did not beat around the bush and told it to him straight. “The rewards were average. We only managed to dig up one god-class gene egg. We are only coming back to ask Mister Wei for help. We want Mister Wei to help us locate the primary land pulse in the river.” “I am afraid that might prove difficult,” Sky King quietly said. “It is not that I do not want to help you, but Mister Wei is not one of my men. He has always avoided such dangerous formations. I am afraid it will be a lot to ask of him. How about this? I will come with you to seek out Mister Wei. He might be more inclined to agree with me there.”

“Thank you very much,” Han Sen said.

Sky King laughed and said, “Do not worry, Mister Han. I really love Bao’er. I still want to take her as a student. Speaking of that, you are no outsider to me. I would like to help you all that I can.”

Although Sky King was there to convince Mister Wei, Mister Wei did not agree to help dig up land pulses around God of Wealth River. He said that place was death, and it was a place that should not be meddled with. He also tried to convince Han Sen and Sky King not to trifle with the area. Otherwise, only bad things would come to pass.

It was fine if Mister Wei did not want to go with them. Han Sen just asked him where the main pulse was along the God of Wealth River, but Mister Wei wouldn’t say. He did not want to be responsible for someone coming to harm.

Han Sen was speechless. He wanted to convince him further, but someone soon arrived. He explained that one of Mister Wei’s students had died outside of the base.

Everyone went to have a look. It was learned that Bald Guy’s Brother Three had been beheaded. He was a crumpled, headless corpse on the floor. Blood was everywhere.

Han Sen and the others knew he had been the power of the break head wire.

Han Sen laughed and coldly thought, “That guy was brave. How dare he dig land pulses along my God of Wealth River?” God of Wealth Temple was currently overseen by Decapitation Queen. The God of Wealth River would not allow anyone to get close to the temple.

Without Han Sen’s permission to go digging land pulses around the God of Wealth River, there was a guaranteed death sentence.

Li Bing Yu and Bald Guy were shocked. They had watched Han Sen murder Decapitation Queen, so they did not understand why the break head wire was still working.

Thinking about that, they looked at Han Sen, who pretended he hadn’t seen anything. He did not want to explain. After this, it was guaranteed that Mister Wei would not tell anyone where the main land pulse was along the God of Wealth River. There was nothing Han Sen could do about it now.

If he couldn’t find the main land pulse, it was pointless digging up ordinary land pulses. The area around God of Wealth River was his territory. He could go digging whenever he wanted to. So, Han Sen planned on going to the other five planets of Ghost Starlight. Perhaps he would find something there.

Sky King told Han Sen that the other five planets had already been taken by people with powers as big as his.

Han Sen frowned. Sky King went on to say, “The god fights are to begin soon. If you are going to risk doing battle with people on other planets, why don’t you ready yourself to participate in the god fights? If you win the first god rank, you can get a rare gene egg as a reward. Wouldn’t that be better than digging up some random stuff from a land pulse?”

“It wouldn’t be bad.” Han Sen had heard Sky King mention the god fights before. He asked Bald Guy what the god fights were. The so-called god fights were about fighting all types of god temples. It was a traditional event associated with god temples that took place every 10 years. They just had to go back to the god temple where they got their Blood-Pulse from and could then represent their God Spirit in battle.

If a challenger managed to defeat all their enemies in these fights, the challenger was rewarded with a rare gene egg.

Even if they did not achieve first place, they got a gene egg as a reward. Everyone in the top 100 got one. If people performed well in the god fights, they were admired by the God Spirits and had the chance to inherit a Blood-Pulse.

Across history, many nobles had been able to earn an eternal god-blood noble status through the god fights.

It was still weird. Every 10 years, there was one rare gene egg. The universe of kingdoms had many billions of years in its history. Many of the rare gene races should have been seen by now. Now, the universe did not have many rare gene races.

There were only seven or eight days left before the next god fights. Sky King had already prepared a return trip so he could participate in the god fights. Han Sen did not have a God Spirit Blood-Pulse, so, he wanted to go back to the God of Wealth Temple and see if he could join the god fights.

There were still seven or eight days until the next god fights, so Han Sen was not in a rush. He followed Bald Guy to dig up more land pulses. He then asked Sky King to send people to deliver the useless gene eggs to Mister Yang in Jade Wall City. At least, his shop would blow up in popularity.

Before Sky King departed, he asked Han Sen to look after the planet. He did not want him to leave the place open for someone else to swoop in and rob all the land pulses.

Han Sen immediately agreed. He had a 30% stake in that planet. For the sake of that 30%, he was not going to allow anyone to take over the place.

After Sky King left, the big sky demon, which had been missing for a while, appeared next to Han Sen.

“My little lover, you made a big mistake.” The big sky demon was next to Han Sen, reaching her hand out to stroke his cheeks. “What mistake did I make?” Han Sen casually asked.

“You killed a member of the God Chaos Party,” the big sky demon said with a sigh. “You slew Decapitation Queen. People from the God Chaos Party will not let you go.”

“If I can kill the Decapitation Queen, I can take down others,” Han Sen coldly said.

The big sky demon behaved as if she was comforting Han Sen. She continued to stroke his cheeks and said, “My little lover, you are strong. You were able to kill Decapitation Queen, but challenging the God Chaos Party will not get you anything if you do not do things right. There is an 80% to 90% chance you will die.”

“Why was I told that the God Chaos Party members were already killed by a sky full of God Spirits and there weren’t any surviving members?” Han Sen asked.

The big sky demon shook her head. “Those guys in the God Chaos Party cannot be easily killed. Many of them died in the past, but a few of the core members were able to remain. The most important thing to know, however, is that the president of the God Chaos Party was not killed. After a billion years of rest, the God Chaos Party is on the cusp of returning.”

“You seem to know a lot about the God Chaos Party.” Han Sen looked at the big sky demon and asked, Are you a member of the God Chaos Party?”

“Yes, I was one of the God Chaos Party’s three vice presidents,” the big sky demon replied with a laugh.

Han Sen was shocked. He had not expected the big sky demon to confess to it so simply.

Han Sen looked at the big sky demon and asked, “Does that mean you are going to try and avenge Decapitation Queen?”

The big sky demon put her face on Han Sen’s chest and said, “Of course not. I would never dream of killing my lover. Plus, I left the God Chaos Party a long time ago.”
