<h2>Leftover Power</h2>
<h3>Chapter 2736</h3>

<p>Han Sen kept firing his two pistols without reprieve, countering
each of Shale’s punching powers. No matter how strong Shale’s
punches were, none of them could come close to touching Han
Sen.</p>
<p>It had taken Li Chun Qiu mere moments to confirm that when Shale
used Star Explode, his power only equaled Han Sen. His expression
looked strained, and he thought to himself, “If this is Han Sen’s
base power, then that is too scary.”</p>
<p>Li Keer and Exquisite were even more stunned, because they knew
for sure that they were only seeing Han Sen’s base power. He wasn’t
using a power-enhancing geno art like Shale was.</p>
<p>His base power was enough to fight back Shale’s Star Explode.
That was almost unbelievable.</p>
<p>In truth, Han Sen thought this was an expected result. After
all, his four top geno arts had all reached a deified level. Each
geno art had the power of a deified, and he had four of them
reinforcing the same body. Their additions to his power weren’t
merely additive.</p>
<p>As time went by, Shale was getting stronger and stronger. His
body shone with ever-increasing starlight, but his punches were
still being negated by Han Sen’s bullets. The ten minutes were
flying by, and Shale’s skin was starting to crack and bleed. It
didn’t look like he was going to last long.</p>
<p>“Han Sen, take my punch again!” Shale roared. He punched toward
Han Sen like a raging madman.</p>
<p>The next second, Han Sen saw the valley before him fill up with
an uncountable number of suns. The punching power was like an
entire constellation exploding.</p>
<p>“Return to Origin under Star Explode. Even a larva deified elite
would have reason to fear that blow,” Li Chun Qiu thought to
himself.</p>
<p>Shale’s performance was greater than he realized. Beneath Star
Explode, he could still perfectly activate a punch using Return to
Origin. Shale’s power and talent were truly excellent.</p>
<p>Han Sen saw the punching power washing toward him like a flooded
river. He didn’t plan on falling back, though. He combined his two
pistols to form another weapon. It was a rocket launcher.</p>
<p>Han Sen lifted the launcher in his arms. He took aim and fired a
rocket at the star river-like punching power. A beam of light was
emitted from the launcher, and it went soaring into the center of
Shale’s attack.</p>
<p>“No matter how strong that rocket is, it cannot go against
Return to Origin while it is fueled by Star Explode,” Li Chun Qiu
thought to himself. The next second, he froze.</p>
<p>The rocket slammed into the center of that stream of punches
that was like a river of stars, and then it detonated like a
nuclear bomb. The explosion consumed every bit of Shale’s punching
power.</p>
<p>Boom!</p>
<p>The following eruption looked as if it could melt the entire
universe. Inside that beautiful example of Star Explode, there was
too much light for the observers to look. They couldn’t see
anything.</p>
<p>When the lights of the explosion receded, Li Chun Qiu saw Han
Sen and Shale still in one piece within the valley. But an enormous
crater had been torn into the stone of the valley between them.</p>
<p>Han Sen didn’t attack, and Shale didn’t attack, either. But
everyone knew Shale had already lost. His Star Explode time was up.
He didn’t have the power to fight Han Sen anymore.</p>
<p>“I lose,” Shale admitted honestly. But Han Sen could tell that
the man still wanted to fight. He wasn’t going to quit because of a
one-time failure.</p>
<p>Li Chun Qiu didn’t say anything. Han Sen really had won. Anyone
could tell Han Sen had far more power than Shale. It wasn’t a
victory that Han Sen had pulled off by the skin of his teeth.</p>
<p>But Li Chun Qiu was confident that if he had more time to raise
Shale to the peak of his power, he would have a chance to beat Han
Sen.</p>
<p>But the Very High man had to admit that Han Sen was strong right
now. In fact, the Crystallizer was stronger than he had imagined.
He thought Han Sen was below Shale and Yu Shanxin, but now, Han
Sen’s battle power was clearly no weaker than theirs. He was
possibly stronger.</p>
<p>“Combat power doesn’t mean anything. The most important thing is
the ability to become a true god. Shale is a fake eleven armor
talent. There is a high chance he can become a true god. That will
be the real victory.” Li Chun Qiu stared at Han Sen, then left the
area with Shale.</p>
<p>“You became deified without informing us. How do you plan on
paying us back for this?” Li Keer smiled at Han Sen as she
spoke.</p>
<p>“I will do whatever you want me to,” Han Sen said while
spreading his hands.</p>
<p>“I want you to stand facing a wall,” Li Keer said, acting
angry.</p>
<p>“I’m a grown-up, not a three-year-old. Punish me another way,”
Han Sen said with a wry smile. Only kids would be punished by
having to face a wall.</p>
<p>“No, you have to face the wall. And you have to face the wall
for a whole month,” Li Keer said with a smile.</p>
<p>Han Sen frowned in annoyance. He wanted to say something, but
Exquisite interrupted, “Stop arguing. Little Sister said you should
face a wall because after a silkworm becomes deified, they have to
go to the ancient wall. That will be good for all of us.”</p>
<p>“I see.” Han Sen just realized Li Keer wasn’t really being
petulant; she was just teasing him.</p>
<p>“But you have just become deified. You can go there in a few
days. You should visit Bao’er and spend some time with her first.
You won’t see her for a whole month while you’re at the ancient
wall,” Exquisite said.</p>
<p>Han Sen nodded, and then Exquisite took him back to the Star
Tree.</p>
<p>Because of what happened before, Li Keer and Exquisite no longer
dared to leave Han Sen’s side. One of them always remained by Han
Sen’s side in case something big happened. That made him super
depressed. He didn’t have any free time anymore.</p>
<p>“I really can’t look like I’m too special. Otherwise, I won’t
have any freedom at all,” Han Sen thought as he sat under the tree
and drank a cup of tea.</p>
<p>Exquisite could see what he was thinking, but she ignored him
and continued reading a book.</p>
<p>“What are you reading?” Han Sen asked, poking his head around
next to her.</p>
<p>“Nothing.” Exquisite snapped the book closed before Han Sen
could see what it was. She placed it in her pocket and cleared her
throat self-consciously.</p>
<p>“What is this Ancient Wall placed that I’m going to?” Although
Han Sen was curious about what Exquisite was reading, if she wasn’t
going to tell him, then he wasn’t going to keep asking.</p>
<p>Exquisite quietly said, “Ancient Wall is a place where one of my
ancestors used to draw.”</p>
<p>“Draw?” Han Sen was surprised.</p>
<p>Seeing Han Sen’s surprise, Exquisite smiled and explained, “It
isn’t an ordinary drawing. He was a famous genius of our race.
Although he never became a leader, he studied the Very High Sense
to a degree that no one else—aside from our alpha—has ever been
able to match.”</p>
<p>After pausing, Exquisite looked up at the Star Fruit above them
and said, “Before he entered the Geno Hall, that elder sat before
the Ancient Wall for two years. Two years later, when he opened his
eyes, the first thing he did was draw a picture on the wall. After
he drew it, he flew away and went to the Geno Hall. The drawing has
been there ever since. It is a legend, and not even now can people
understand what that drawing is about.”</p>
