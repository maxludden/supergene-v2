  Han Sen quickly retreated, and he summoned his gold Demon Bug King Bai Sema to shield his exterior.

Boom!

The invisible substance chain came down upon the gold Demon Bug King Bai Sema. The Bai Sema kept trembling, and squeaky noises sounded loudly. It sounded as if it was going to break.

Han Sen was shocked. Most of Fox Queen’s power was being used in dampening the chain’s restrictions on her. Even so, the Demon Bug King Bai Sema could not withstand a small amount of her total power. If she was to repeat that same action a few more times, she was sure to break it.

“A deified elite sure is scary. Just a little amount of power is able to beat any sort of creature.” Han Sen was thinking about how he might escape this extremely difficult situation he had found himself in.

Fox Queen was not surprised Han Sen had been able to block her first strike. She thought he was General Ghost Bone, and so that was why she was not surprised he had managed to deflect the hit.

The substance chain she slashed did not relent. It was like a chain that snared the Demon Bug King Bai Sema, and it tightened and tried to throttle it.

Han Sen saw that the Bai Sema was flickering. A lot of its gold dust was being scraped away by the tightening noose. He frowned.

“Fox Queen, when I first came here, do you remember the first thing I said?” Han Sen was talking with Fox Queen while he was still inside the Bai Sema.

“Ghost Bone, save it! This is the day you die,” Fox Queen coldly said.

Han Sen quickly thought for a moment, and then said, “What about the things we spoke about during our time in White Bone Big Hell? Ghost Bone could not have heard that, surely! You said my name of San Mu is bad! You said one wood was boring enough, and the fact that I have three wood makes me super boring.”

Fox Queen was shocked. She frowned and looked at Han Sen, and it seemed as if she was starting to believe his claims.

“General Ghost Bone’s will was destroyed by me. I was afraid you might want to enact revenge on me, and so that is why I initially maintained the disguise and pretended to be him. I am really not Ghost Bone,” Han Sen said.

Fox Queen gazed at Han Sen for a while, and she then asked, “What was the xenogeneic you saw inside White Bone Big Hell?”

Han Sen immediately described the face of the xenogeneic. After Fox Queen heard what he said, she believed him even more.

Fox Queen hesitated for a moment, and then she asked Han Sen, “When you were brought here by Little Black, I did not talk to you. What did I say?”

“You did talk to me.” Han Sen thought, and then he said to her, “Come…”

Fox Queen, when hearing Han Sen, looked to be startled. The substance chain on the Bai Sema started to fade. Her eyes opened wide, and with a look of disbelief, she looked at Han Sen. “You really are San Mu?”

“I really am San Mu. I am not Ghost Bone. How can I make you believe me?” Han Sen felt as if he was going to cry. He should not have tried to disguise himself as General Ghost Bone. He should have been honest with her.

“The way you think and speak is different, but Ghost Bone is evil…” Fox Queen was still a little hesitant to believe him. She did not believe Han Sen could overcome and destroy the will of General Ghost Bone.

General Ghost Bone was of the top ten generals of Sacred. Her and General Ghost Bone were deified, but not even she could come close to defeating General Ghost Bone. Han Sen was merely a Duke.

“I really am San Mu.” Han Sen felt bad. He did not know of a surefire way in which he could prove his identity to her.

“How did you destroy General Ghost Bone’s will,” Fox Queen looked at Han Sen and asked the question.

Han Sen answered, “I am talented. My willpower exceeds the willpower of deified elites. For General Ghost Bone to invade my will with his own was nothing more than a death wish I could grant.”

Fox Queen still did not believe it, and she looked at Han Sen. She knew General Ghost Bone well, and he really did not sound like him while speaking.

Han Sen thought and said, “Even if General Ghost Bone overtook my body, he would not have access to my memories.”

“It is possible. Consuming one’s will and taking over their memories is not a difficult task for Ghost Bone,” Fox Queen said.

Han Sen stayed quiet. He could not explain this.

Fox Queen suddenly smiled. “It is easy to prove if you’re Ghost Bone. Follow me to White Bone Big Hell and we will see.”

“Why?” Han Sen asked.

Fox Queen smiled. “The xenogeneic in White Bone Big Hell is the product of a mistake on Ghost Bone’s part. Ghost Bone did not know what was going on outside, and when he returned, it was only as a Ghost Bone Mask. He never entered White Bone Big Hell again, and so he does not know there is a xenogeneic inside. And that xenogeneic was approved to be there by White Bone Big Hell. Ghost Bone used to be the boss in White Bone Big Hell, so, if you are Ghost Bone and you go to White Bong Big Hell, the xenogeneic will sense your presence. It will fight you. White Bong Big Hell cannot have two leaders.”

“I can try,” Han Sen said.

Fox Queen did not say much, and so she simply walked to the other side of the main hall. She used the key to open the hellish skeletal gate. Then, she brought Han Sen back to White Bone Big Hell.

Han Sen stood atop the peak of White Bone Big Hell, and he did not feel anything special.

Han Sen had been worried this his Ghost Bone power would trigger White Bone Big Hell. Fortunately, nothing of the sort happened.

Fox Queen kept staring at Han Sen, ready to kill him at a moment’s notice. But when Han Sen entered, White Bone Big hell did not have any reaction. The xenogeneic did not come looking for Han Sen, and so this surprised her a good deal.

“You really are San Mu.” Fox Queen started to properly believe Han Sen now.

“Sis, I really am San Mu.” Han Sen presented her with a wry smile.

Fox Queen brushed her hair and looked at Han Sen queerly. “Ghost Bone would never believe he’d have been killed by a Duke.”

Hearing her say that, Han Sen breathed a big sigh of relief. It seemed as if Fox Queen well and truly believed him.

“Fox Queen, Ghost Bone is dead. You and I have no grudge with each other, so there is no need for a fight. How about we search for a way in which we might be able to leave here? That way, you can go back to exploring the world,” Han Sen said, while looking at Fox Queen.

Fox Queen sighed. “If I could break the lock, I would already be out. Why else would I be guarding here?”

“You cannot leave this place alone. Maybe there will be the way with both of us. Tell me about the lock, and maybe I will have a way to break it.” Han Sen wanted to keep Fox Queen, and he wanted to find out if there was a way to leave that place.

That past month, Han Sen had spent time examining the restrictions and boundaries put upon the palace. He used his Purple-Eye Butterfly to see things, but he did not find a way in which to break the restrictions.

Now, things were different. Ghost Bone had used the rest of his power to give him a Ghost Bone body. Han Sen could now break the restrictions, he wagered.
