<p>“She is Han Sen’s daughter? Is that just a coincidence?” Sky
King’s heart flashed with many thoughts, but his face did not seem
to change. He behaved as if he did not know Han Sen.</p>
<p>Han Sen stroked Bao’er’s head as he asked, “Bao’er, what are you
doing here?”</p>
<p>He really wanted to know why Bao’er was there and how she
reached the anti-material world. In front of Sky King, Han Sen
could not ask such questions. Bao’er understood, which was probably
why the DNA test read positive for her being his biological
daughter. She understood and said, “Dad, I was playing here. I
picked up this cute flying fish and this Mister Nice Guy. He gave
me a beautiful pendant.”</p>
<p>After that, Bao’er showed off the new pendant that was hanging
around her chest. She seemed to be very fond of it.</p>
<p>“Bao’er, is this really how I’ve been teaching you in the past?
I’m pretty sure it isn’t. How could you do such a thing?” Han Sen
looked seriously displeased with her.</p>
<p>When Sky King heard Bao’er claim to pick up a cute flying fish,
his eyes twitched. “Can you just randomly pick something like that
up? How much luck would a person need to have such good things
happen to them?” Then, Bao’er had called him Mister Nice Guy and
said he had given it to her. It was not just his eyes twitching. It
felt as if his heart was going to twitch.</p>
<p>Hearing Han Sen tell off Bao’er, he felt a bit better. “It looks
like this Han Sen has more morals than I gave him credit for. It’s
just that this kid does not behave.” Bao’er looked wronged. “It’s
not like I wanted it or even asked for it. He just decided to give
it to me.”</p>
<p>“Really?” Han Sen asked Bao’er. “Let me have a look at that
pendant.” He collected the Sky Order and examined it closely.</p>
<p>Sky King thought, “With this Sky Order here, Han Sen is sure to
recognize who I am. That is fine. Although it looks bad, I think
Han Sen will respect me. He will give it back to me.” Sky King saw
Han Sen walk in front of him. He thought Han Sen would give the Sky
Order back to him, but Han Sen held the Sky Order and asked, “Old
Mister, you gave this to my daughter. What is this?”</p>
<p>Sky King was surprised. He could not believe Han Sen did not
recognize the Sky Order. Looking at Han Sen’s face, it did not seem
as if he was pretending to be unaware.</p>
<p>“Oh, it was nothing much. It was just my gift to her. It is just
a silly little jade pendant. It is nothing of any significant value
or meaning. It is only worth a bit of dosh, but that’s about it.”
Sky King gnashed his teeth and thought, “I suppose it is a good
thing he does not recognize it. If he did, that could probably lead
to some embarrassment of sorts.” Han Sen lifted the jade pendant
before Sky King. He thought Han Sen was going to return it to him,
but Han Sen said, “You are very nice, Old Mister. You gave my
daughter such a nice gift. You are a very nice man.”</p>
<p>“Of course, not. I just thought our encounter was destiny, and
she is such a loveable girl. That is why I gave her this gift. It
was so I could be nice.” Sky King had to force his pleasant
behavior, despite his earnest unwillingness to say such things. The
flying fish was still staring at him. Sky King did not dare move.
If Han Sen attacked him, he would have been absolutely destroyed.
He did not dare to offend Han Sen.</p>
<p>“Well, it is nice to know you are an honest man. My daughter is
indeed quite loveable. Everyone who sees her says she is so smart
and nice.” Han Sen looked cocky as spoke. He seemed very proud of
her.</p>
<p>When Sky King heard Han Sen say that, he wanted to stomp and
spit on his face. He wanted to curse him. He thought, “What is
this? You raised such a horrible daughter, yet you are so proud of
her?”</p>
<p>Although he felt bad, his mouth only returned an affirmative. He
unwillingly had to agree with what Han Sen said.</p>
<p>Han Sen went on to say, “The daughter always resembles the
father. Old Mister, do you think my daughter looks like me?” “Do
you?” Sky King unwillingly looked at them both. He did not think
the two looked similar.</p>
<p>Bao’er had a circular face, whereas Han Sen’s face was quite
long and sharp. Bao’er’s eyes were obviously bigger than his so Sky
King did not think the two looked similar at all.</p>
<p>“Very similar. Everyone says me and her look like clones,” Han
Sen seriously said.</p>
<p>“Right.” Sky King could not be bothered to talk to Han Sen. He
just nodded.</p>
<p>“I say, you must also think we look similar. Yes?” Han Sen
looked delighted. He put the Sky Order in front of Sky King.</p>
<p>Sky King was happy. “Although this guy is talking nonsense, at
least he has the courtesy of showing respect.”</p>
<p>Han Sen just waved the Sky Order in front of him. It did not
look as if he was going to give it back. He went on to say, “You
are getting along with my daughter so well, and I look so similar
to my daughter, fate must want us to be together. You even gave my
daughter a pendant and said so yourself. In that case, I will…”</p>
<p>Sky King was so angry that he almost started spewing blood. He
had seen shameless people before, but he had never seen someone
this shameless. He understood why he had said the two looked so
similar. They were both extremely obscene and shameless. They were
the same. It was like they were a clone of each other.</p>
<p>Fortunately, Sky King had seen a lot and kept his cool. He knew
that Han Sen must have recognized him and only pretended not to
know him to scam him.</p>
<p>Sky King was not afraid of Han Sen’s scamming. He was just
afraid of being scammed and attacked. If he did that, he would lose
his money and life.</p>
<p>When he looked at the flying fish that was ready to go, Sky King
gnashed his teeth and said, “Of course, fate did bring us together.
The three of us are fated to be together, but I only have this one
pendant to give. I do have something that is associated with fate
though. I just don’t know if you will like it.”</p>
<p>After that, Sky King transferred a gene race to Han Sen.</p>
<p>“Got god-class gene race eight-armed evil dragon. Growth mode is
ultimate.”</p>
<p>“Old Mister is very nice. It is an honor for me and my daughter
to have met you.” Han Sen smiled and thanked him.</p>
<p>Sky King gnashed his teeth, planning on how to respond. When Han
Sen finished, he took Bao’er and turned around.</p>
<p>Bao’er was holding the flying fish. She kept walking and looking
back, waving at Sky King. “Mister Nice Guy, let’s play again next
time we meet.”</p>
<p>Sky King did not expect Han Sen to just leave like that. He was
frozen. “Surely he cannot actually recognize me.”</p>
<p>He did not think this was possible. If Han Sen did not know him,
when he saw the eight-armed evil dragon, he would have reacted.</p>
<p>Even a fool seeing the ultimate-mode, eight-armed evil dragon
would have known he was a superior sort of person.</p>
<p>“This guy is so weird, and his daughter is too. Why would the
flying fish be so nice to his daughter? It was a gene race that
consumed a God Spirit Blood-Pulse.” The very powerful Sky King
thought the father and daughter were mysterious.</p>
<p>As he watched them walk a good distance away, he could hear Han
Sen speaking to Bao’er. “Bao’er, don’t do this again. If you meet a
nice person like that, how could you only take one pendant? That is
not respectful to a nice pendant. You have to at least take
two.”</p>
<p>“Yes, I am sorry.”</p>
<p>Hearing the two of them talk that way, Sky King’s face turned
lime green and then dark green. It was colorful.</p>
