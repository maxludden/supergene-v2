    <p>
      Usually, after Han Sen finished a training cycle of the Dongxuan Sutra,
      his body would be filled up and require a cooldown period in which the
      energy was digested. Training more while he was still full yielded no
      additional benefits, and was therefore pointless.
    </p>

    <p>
      But underneath that great tree, something strangely wonderful happened.
      After a very short while, he felt as if the energy was gone. He decided to
      try to practice the Dongxuan Sutra again and, lo and behold, he was
      renewed with fresh power once more.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen began training his Dongxuan Sutra again and before long, his body
      was charged up again.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen used this time to observe the bone elephant, which continued to
      look holy. The elephant was like a jade statue. Seeing it for the first
      time, no one would have guessed how cruel and murderous it actually was.
    </p>

    <p>
      The bodies of the other creatures were glowing as well. Han Sen
      couldn&#8217;t tell what the light was exactly, he just thought it was
      different than usual.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen watched the energy flow through the bone elephant&#8217;s body and
      tried to record a visualization of it in his mind.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen did not know how long this concordant situation would last. So, he
      took the chance to remember how the elephant harnessed its energy, in the
      event the technique might one day become useful.
    </p>

    <p>
      The peach flowers were open for two weeks. During that time, Han Sen
      managed to record the energy flow of both the elephant and the cub.
    </p>

    <p>
      When the peach flowers on the trees began to wilt, the silver fox tugged
      at Han Sen&#8217;s pants and tried to pull him away from the area.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen felt something was wrong, as well. As the peach flowers began to
      wilt more and more, the creatures seemed to be getting more and more
      restless.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen noticed a slight reddish hue beginning to tint the eyes of the
      bone elephant. It looked as if it would soon resume its murderous rampage.
    </p>

    <p>
      He didn&#8217;t dare stay any longer, and so he decided to depart with
      Zero before anything went awry. If the creatures started to go berserk,
      with his small body, there was no chance he&#8217;d be able to withstand
      an attack dealt by any of them.
    </p>

    <p>
      For the two weeks he had been there, Han Sen constantly repeated his
      practice of the Dongxuan Sutra. His body had been hungry for it the entire
      time. Having received so much additional experience training with it, his
      Dongxuan Sutra had greatly improved. Han Sen felt as if he had just about
      touched the first tier of the Dongxuan Sutra, and all he&#8217;d need was
      some sort of extra push to get the gene lock open.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen had thought it would take a few years to reach this point, but his
      two weeks under the tree had saved a lot of time. That giant peach tree
      was the most remarkable of boons.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;If the open flowers of the tree have such a remarkable power, if it
      grew peaches and I ate one, I wonder what would happen?&#8221; Han Sen
      decided that when the mystic peach tree grew its harvest of peaches, he
      would return to this place and collect some, no matter what it took.
    </p>

    <p>
      But Han Sen imagined that when the mystic peach tree did grow its peaches,
      there would undoubtedly be chaos. Nabbing a few peaches for himself would
      most likely prove difficult.
    </p>

    <p>
      The silver fox now seemed to be in a rush, wanting to lead Han Sen out of
      the forest as quickly as it could. They only slowed down when they had
      moved beyond the eaves of the forest. At that point, the silver fox
      gleefully returned to Han Sen&#8217;s shoulder.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen could faintly hear the screams of nefarious beasts in the forest.
      Not wanting to hang around any longer, he ran off with Zero.
    </p>

    <p>
      When Han Sen returned to Devil&#8217;s Shelter, the bone elephant did not
      return the way it came, to the best of his knowledge. It was as if it had
      simply disappeared, and it was never seen or heard from again.
    </p>

    <p>
      Wang Yuhang, however, was a household name around Devil&#8217;s Shelter,
      and many people became aware of the existence of the Goddess Army. They
      also &#8220;knew&#8221; that Wang Yuhang was its thirteenth general. The
      people who were not privy to the truth believed the Goddess Army to be an
      incredibly strong angelic host. They thought it was responsible for
      slaying the bone elephant by leading it away, saving the shelter in the
      process.
    </p>

    <p>
      Another two weeks passed, and the Flaming Rex Spike was still in the
      process of evolving. It looked like super beast souls took a long time to
      evolve. Han Sen estimated it would take another two weeks for the
      evolution to complete.
    </p>

    <p>
      Back in the Alliance, Han Sen considered choosing a new hyper geno art
      that would go well with his Flaming Rex Spike. Han Sen conducted a lot of
      research, but found it difficult to select a skill that would suit his
      needs.
    </p>

    <p>
      The Flaming Rex Spike was neither greatsword nor lance, and he
      couldn&#8217;t even use it like a club.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;No wonder the shopkeeper sold it to me so cheaply, with a quick
      cash-trade agreement. Pah, this thing is too unpopular!&#8221; Han Sen
      continued looking at skills in the hope he&#8217;d eventually find one
      that would go well with his Flaming Rex Spike.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen did not expect a perfect match, but one that was 70% would do. If
      he found one like that, then he&#8217;d be happy to modify it to his
      needs.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen had almost browsed through all the S-class hyper geno arts, from
      most popular to least popular without finding one that he wanted.
    </p>

    <p>
      The creepy-looking weapon was far too rare. It was a heavy weapon, and it
      could only be held like a greatsword with both hands. If you held it with
      one hand, then it would require a tremendous amount of strength.
    </p>

    <p>
      It wasn&#8217;t like a sword, which could be swung around quickly. This
      weapon was tailored for powerful, gruesome blows through lance-like
      thrusting or club-like crushing. But these two forms of attack were best
      suited to the weapons that were designed for those purposes, lances and
      clubs respectively. The Flaming Rex Spike seemed as if it would be awkward
      to use.
    </p>

    <p>
      For a two meter long, single-handed weapon, it looked extremely powerful,
      but it was a shame that it was so difficult to wield.
    </p>

    <p>
      In the end, Han Sen went to look for Professor Bai Yishan in the Saint
      Hall. Han Sen drew the shape of the Flaming Rex Spike and presented it to
      the professor, to see if he knew of any suitable skills for the weapon.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Hold on a second.&#8221; Bai Yishan went peruse further
      information. Half an hour later, he returned to his communicator and told
      Han Sen, &#8220;This weapon is very rare. But I do remember one fellow who
      created a weapon that operates similarly. It may look a little different,
      yes, but functionally it&#8217;s the same. It is a single-handed weapon
      that is most suitable for jabbing or thrusting, and heavy swings. The man
      created a skill for it, but it wasn&#8217;t anything exceptional. It was
      only ranked as an A-class skill here in the Saint Hall. It was called
      Toxic-Dragon Drill; you should take a look at it if you&#8217;re
      interested.&#8221;
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Thank you, Professor Bai.&#8221; Han Sen had no other choice. Being
      only A-class, it was far worse than Han Sen expected. Professor Bai
      himself had told him that there were no S-class hyper geno arts that
      suited it.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen returned to the Saint Hall and purchased the A-class hyper geno
      art Toxic-Dragon Drill. Han Sen observed it intently. Although it was only
      A-class, it was indeed quite suitable for the Flaming Rex Spike. It mainly
      employed thrusts and heavy smashes. The thrusting component featured a
      spinning technique, as well. Han Sen was pretty good with it, right off
      the bat. After a brief look, he was already performing exceptionally well
      with it.
