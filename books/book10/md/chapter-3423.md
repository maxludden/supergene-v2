  In the god temple of the Annihilation God Spirit, the cause-element main god’s body was trembling. The other creatures could not see the slash performed, but he knew that if he was hit by it, not only ordinary spirits but also Annihilation-class god temple main gods would be wiped from the history of the universe. They would be cleaned from the history books with no chance of ever recovering.

Even the reviving power of a god temple could not save a life that did not exist.

Demon Alpha’s slash was so powerful that it could erase cause powers. If the cause did not exist, how could there be such a result?

Putting aside reincarnation, all traces and prior existences of the creature struck by this hit would be wiped from the records. He would cease to exist, forever and always.

Even the memory of that being in the minds of creatures that knew him would vanish. It would be like that spirit never existed in the sky or on the ground.

“How scary would that cause power be? This is the level I have been looking for all my life, yet it is with someone who does not have a God Spirit. Who is this Demon Alpha?” The Annihilation main god looked terrible.

Han Sen could see the scary slash too. His body was currently not useful, but he could see everything clearly in the face of that powerful adversity. It was like he had everything under control. His body was able to deal with it naturally.

Han Sen did not fight back because he still wanted to know the answer from Demon Alpha. Even if he killed Demon Alpha, that would still be useless for Han Sen. He needed Demon Alpha to live to be given the answer he needed.

Han Sen could not run geno arts. When he needed power, his body made lots of different reactions and created the powers he would need. They were just like his body.

Han Sen did not move, but the invisible and powerful power still continued to spread. The universal cogwheels around Han Sen’s body stopped spinning. They put Han Sen in an absolutely still space.

It did not matter if the wind, fire, thunder, lightning, time, or space powers were being used. They were all useless in trying to bring down Han Sen and his power. They were all cut off via his body.

This was like Han Sen’s Dongxuan Aura, but it was different. The power of the Dongxuan Aura was stronger and more absolute. It was not an independent type of aura either. It assimilated with Han Sen and became a part of his natural instincts.

It hit the scary cause power and destroyed it. When it landed on Han Sen, it simply vanished. It was like the wind was suddenly blowing in another direction. Everything came to a standstill.

There were no signs to suggest it would be stopped, nor did it struggle. It almost looked as if it was supposed to stop where it was.

The eyes of Demon Alpha and the cause-element Annihilation God Spirit almost popped out of their sockets. They could not believe what they were seeing. Such a powerful force of cause power had not even been able to ruffle a single strand of Han Sen’s hair. It was just gone.

“You… What did you do?” Demon Alpha could not believe it and looked at Han Sen. She could not fathom this result.

Demon Alpha knew what that power meant. She did not believe someone in the world could ignore the extent of the power she had just unleashed. She did not think Qin Xiu could repel what she wielded either.

Now, Han Sen easily blocked her full-power attack. He had not even asserted a defensive position.

Han Sen looked at Demon Alpha and asked, “Should I continue?”

Han Sen had been worried that he would not be able to block that utterly crazy attack power. Now, he knew for sure that cause power was not able to affect him.

The Dongxuan Aura became the base of his body’s power. He could easily control all of the universe’s cogwheels and rules. Even a powerful cause power was unable to break his sense of perception.

The voice of the geno tablet played in Han Sen’s head. “Your body does have a problem. Even a Reboot God Spirit’s cause power cannot affect your body.”

“What? Are you saying Demon Alpha was using Reboot-class cause powers to fight me?” Han Sen almost screamed aloud.

“If it was not a Reboot-class being, how could it wipe cause from existence?” the geno tablet replied. “The God Spirits can reverse cause powers, but they can only use one or two tricks. They never really use it. They can never really control it or change it. Aside from a Reboot-class God Spirit, no God Spirit can do what you’ve just repelled. Of course, when my host becomes the world’s new God Spirit, they will have that power.”

“Are you sure that is the power of something Reboot class?” Han Sen asked.

“I don’t think I’d be wrong about something like this, but her Reboot-class power is not complete,” the geno tablet answered. “If it was a complete Reboot-class cause power, with that strike, the whole of the 33 skies would be wiped from the map.”

Han Sen’s eyes looked sunny and dark. Night God No Moon had told him there were five spirits who had Reboot-class blood, and they all came from the last geno hall leader.

Asura could not have consumed the current god hall leader. It was not Bao’er, so only three possibilities remained.

It had to be Tai Yi and King Jun’s last life, two of Qin Xiu’s previous lives, or the last god hall leader.

No matter which of them it was, Han Sen thought the suggested concepts were rather difficult to believe. Back in the day, Asura would have been too weak. Either of those three could have killed Asura several times over with but a whiff of their breath.

And back then, Asura must have consumed one of them. Again, that did not seem likely nor possible.

“It should not have been the last god hall leader. When the last god hall leader died, Asura and the others were not born at that time. How did the alpha of the Witch die? I forgot to ask Chaos. The most likely possibility was a remnant of Qin Xiu’s life since he was the one who reincarnated the most. He is the most likely candidate. No…” Han Sen was thinking to himself. Because he was so shocked, he continued to revel in his thoughts. “Asura said she consumed a God Spirit. The alpha of the Witch was one of the Witch. After reincarnating, he would not become a God Spirit. Qin Xiu would not reincarnate as a God Spirit either. Does that mean Asura consumed the last god hall leader?”

“That cannot be right. The timing is not right. The last god hall leader died because of the need to reboot the universe. When he died, Ancient Devil and Asura reincarnated. After being reincarnated for many years, they grew strong enough to kill a god. It could not have been the last god hall leader. Did Asura make a mistake? Does she believe the reincarnation of Alpha Witch and the reincarnation of Human Alpha, who had a God Spirit Blood-Pulse, were actually God Spirits?” Han Sen’s brain was flashing with countless different ideas. He could not think of a final solution. He looked at Demon Alpha, Asura, with conflicted emotions.

“It all depends on whether or not you are that strong.” Demon Alpha was not willing to stop. The God Spirit light was frightening. She put her hands together and exploded with a powerful cause power that was sent straight toward Han Sen.

The creatures of the world could not see the cause spirit power. They could only see two people exchanging dialogue, with neither of the two making a move. They were all yelling, “You two hurry up and fight! Stop talking! These are the geno tablet fights. This is not a street fight. Stop chatting!”
