<p>While Han Sen was worried about Golden Growler, Golden Growler suddenly opened his mouth. This time, it did not bite in the direction of Very High Leader.</p>

<p>Golden Growler’s mouth exuded a gold light. Golden lights came out like a hose. Inside that golden light, something else appeared.</p>

<p>Han Sen saw the corner of the golden substance. It had some carvings that were both beautiful and weird. When that thing emerged, Han Sen clearly saw it was a door coming out of Golden Growler’s mouth.</p>

<p>The door looked as if it was made of gold. It was hundreds of feet tall. The door had some weird and mysterious flower symbols. It made people feel scared and have a desire to obey with a magnitude that could not be described. Han Sen did not understand what those flower symbols were like, but the beast head on the door was something Han Sen recognized. It was Golden Growler’s face.</p>

<p>The golden door was surrounded by a golden halo. One could not see the door frame. The strangest thing about it was that no matter which angle one looked at it from, one only saw the front face of the door. It was like that golden door did not have a back, or its back was blended into the backdrop of space. It was like it was from a different world.</p>

<p>“Why did Golden Growler’s belly have a golden door inside it?” Han Sen felt weird. He did not know what the golden door did.</p>

<p>Very High Leader frowned as he looked at the golden door. He did not know what it was either.</p>

<p>“What is this?”</p>

<p>“Weird. The growlers are always so violent. I have never heard of one using a treasure before, but Golden Growler is using a treasure. What does this golden door do?”</p>

<p>Every creature was discussing its presence. No one had ever seen this golden door before. They were unable to come up with a suitable conclusion. Even the higher races, such as the Extreme King and Very High, could only stare at that door in wonder. They wanted to know what the door did.</p>

<p>Dong! When Golden Growler growled, the door’s ring was shaken open. It made a deep sound like a hammer.</p>

<p>When the door ring was hit open, the golden door made a katcha sound and opened up a little. Gold light spilled from the slightly ajar door.</p>

<p>Everybody’s eyes were opened wide. They stared at the ajar door, desperate to see what was inside.</p>

<p>The golden door opened slowly. The gap was only enough for a fist. So far, people could only see golden light. Before they could figure it out or see what lay beyond, they suddenly heard Very High Leader make a weird sound. “This is…” Very High Leader stared at the golden door. His expression immediately changed. In the next moment, Very High Leader’s body had some weird power that spread like the tide.</p>

<p>Everybody thought Very High Leader was going to fight back, but Very High Leader moved his body. He ripped space and exited the space battleground.</p>

<p>The whole universe was dead silent. No one believed Very High Leader was willing to concede and leave the geno god list.</p>

<p>“Holy crap… What is this golden door? The door did not even open and yet, Very High Leader was scared away.”</p>

<p>“Yes. I want to know more about that golden door.”</p>

<p>“That is so depressing. Very High Leader quit too fast. Even if he decided to leave, he should have waited until the door was opened to let us see what lay beyond it.”</p>

<p>Everyone was both shocked and depressed. After Very High Leader was gone, Golden Growler opened his mouth and put the golden door away. No one knew what was inside the golden door.</p>

<p>“Huh, that old man was smart,” the green-haired beast said with a smile. He looked cocky. “Little Mountain Leader is invincible.”</p>

<p>Han Sen was confused. He did not see what was inside the golden door. What could have scared Very High Leader away? “Interesting.” God looked at Golden Growler with interest and that was all. Han Sen was disappointed to not hear his explanation.</p>

<p>That fight made Golden Growler and the golden door’s name explode across the universe. Just opening it ajar was enough to scare away Very High Leader was immensely terrifying.</p>

<p>After this fight, Golden Growler was already the first rank in the geno god list. No one was really able to dethrone him.</p>

<p>In fact, no one dared to challenge Golden Growler. He had scared off Very High Leader, so that performance was too scary. As some people looked for Very High Leader to request an explanation on what happened, Very High Leader only answered, “Right now, the universe does not have a creature that can fight Golden Growler.”</p>

<p>After he said that, Golden Growler’s title increased even more. It made other creatures even more scared of him. No one dared to challenge Golden Growler.</p>

<p>The top rank was supposed to be very popular and competitive, but it was now cold. the rankings below it had become more popular. Han Sen a shock was shocked by the fact that Lou Lie was ranked third. He challenged Demon Alpha, who was in fourth. This lower-level challenge made people drop their glasses. Everybody was excited about this fight. Lou Lie was a very mysterious character. He was the biggest black horse, aside from Dollar, in the geno god list fights. Demon Alpha’s killing of Dragon One shocked the whole universe. The two of them fighting made everyone concerned.</p>

<p>Lou Lie must be in Blood Legion. Why is he challenging Demon Alpha? Are the people of Blood Legion suspicious about Demon Alpha and the shura people? Are they trying to find out who Demon Alpha is? Han Sen kept thinking. There was only one possibility. Otherwise, he would not have to lower his level.</p>

<p>Han Sen thought he could see something in this fight, but Demon Alpha did not even respond to the challenge. He merely gave up. The funnier thing was that after Demon Alpha gave up, his rank increased. She went from fourth to third. The winner, Lou Lie, was made fourth.</p>

<p>“Your rules are so unscientific.” Han Sen was a bit speechless as he looked at God drinking his tea and chilling.</p>

<p>God smiled and asked, “Isn’t it interesting?”</p>

<p>The challenges had been going on, but the rankings did not change much. That was especially true of the top 10. There were not many changes there. Han Sen was watching them for six days. One of the top 10 dropped out, but the other nine remained in the top 10. Some of their positions changed. Han Sen waited many days, but no one seemed to challenge Burning Lamp. He was depressed, but then he saw the space battleground flicker with light. Burning Lamp and another name appeared. Someone is challenging Burning Lamp. Han Sen was delighted. He looked at the space battleground and saw Burning Lamp enter the space battleground. Han Sen did not see him wielding a knife.</p>

<p>Another shape took form in the space battleground too. It was the one above Han Sen. It was number 99. It was a deified xenogeneic called Pluto Peacock.</p>
