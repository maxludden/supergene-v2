    <p>
      Han Sen returned his gaze to the Devil-Blood King. He seemed to be faring
      better than black tiger, and he seemed to have a better handle on enduring
      the effects. But, before long, his face too began to reveal the purple
      pattern.
    </p>

    <p>
      Roar! The black tiger&#8217;s call was deafening, and it flapped its wings
      and flew towards the griffin. Its speed had doubled.
    </p>

    <p>
      The griffin cried out in response, and flew to engage the tiger with its
      talons raised. But its courage was for naught. In the same second they
      made contact with each other, a wide part of its flesh was torn right from
      the bone.
    </p>

    <p>
      Previously, they were almost as strong as each other. But now, the tiger
      was dominating its foe. The griffin couldn&#8217;t resist the black tiger,
      which far exceeded it in every department; power and speed, in particular.
      It wasn&#8217;t long before the griffin&#8217;s entire body was riddled
      with a variety of wounds and lesions, many of which exposed the bones
      inside.
    </p>

    <p>
      Seeing the vast boon of power that the black tiger had been granted, the
      other super creatures in the area suddenly became excited.
    </p>

    <p>
      Roar! Many creatures roared to the sky in unison, then they all stampeded
      towards the vine. Desperately, they all wanted to grab the final two fruit
      that remained.
    </p>

    <p>
      The mountain was quickly thrown into chaos once more. The only difference
      this time was that the griffin was badly injured and the lime-green
      elephant was struggling to compete with its two enemies.
    </p>

    <p>
      In the meantime, the Devil-Blood King still lay on the ground, seemingly
      uninterested in trying to obtain the final two fruits the other creatures
      were vying for. The creatures were panicked, and pandemonium reigned as
      they tried to grab the fruit before the Devil-Blood King could stand back
      up again.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;This is not right. It really isn&#8217;t right.&#8221; Han Sen
      continued to stare at the Devil-Blood King and the black tiger, which had
      become far stronger since eating the Empty Fruit.
    </p>

    <p>
      He believed that there was something wrong, though. And as he looked on
      the Devil-Blood King, he knew the spirit was struggling. Something
      wasn&#8217;t right. He believed the Devil-Blood King remained motionless
      so that he could better attempt to resist something.
    </p>

    <p>
      But if the Empty Fruit was supposed to benefit those that consumed it, why
      would he resist?
    </p>

    <p>
      The Devil-Blood King continued to lie where it was, with the occasional
      twitch. The pattern scrawled its way across more and more of the
      creature&#8217;s face. It seemed as if it would not be long before he
      forewent his current control and composure.
    </p>

    <p>Boom!</p>

    <p>
      The lime elephant could no longer withstand the combined attacks of the
      black-flame phoenix and the green kirin. The chain of their defensive
      circle broke, opening an opportunity for them all to race up towards the
      vine.
    </p>

    <p>
      The black-flame phoenix screamed with excitement, and like a sentient
      flame, rushed over to the Empty Fruit and swallowed one.
    </p>

    <p>
      The green kirin followed it from behind and attempted to eat the final
      fruit. Just as it attempted to grab it, another super creature prevented
      its retrieval.
    </p>

    <p>
      The black skeleton was there, and it had taken its chance to race up the
      peak and grab the final fruit with its bony fingers.
    </p>

    <p>
      All the other creatures stopped moving immediately. Now that the Empty
      Fruit was all gone, there was no longer any point in fighting over it.
    </p>

    <p>
      The black-flame phoenix and the black skeleton immediately reacted like
      the black tiger had; they collapsed.
    </p>

    <p>
      When the other super creatures sought to leave the area, they suddenly
      heard screaming. The Devil-Blood King stood upon two feet once more and
      yelled out to the high heavens. His face was scribbled all over by the
      strange purple pattern.
    </p>

    <p>
      Many of the terrifying creatures believed the Devil-Blood King was going
      to become even stronger, but they were wrong. The Devil-Blood King reached
      out a hand, and his fingers morphed into the shape of claws. The entire
      hand turned blood-red, and it looked as if blood was going to ooze from it
      any second.
    </p>

    <p>
      All the creatures seemed alert, and they paid great attention to the
      Devil-Blood King. They believed he was going to attack and mercilessly
      slaughter them. But what happened next put them in a state of frozen
      surprise.
    </p>

    <p>
      The Devil-Blood King shouted as his blood-red hand tore off his own armor.
      When he was done, he punched his fist through his naked chest and ripped
      his own heart out.
    </p>

    <p>
      Everyone and everything was shocked by the spectacle they had just
      witnessed, unable to comprehend why the mighty Devil-Blood King had
      suddenly chosen to tear his own heart out.
    </p>

    <p>Pang!</p>

    <p>
      The Devil-Blood King clenched the hand that held his heart into a fist,
      squashing it into jelly as his body vanished and returned to the spirit
      stone he belonged to.
    </p>

    <p>When his body vanished, an Empty Fruit dropped to the ground.</p>

    <p>
      But it was no longer an Empty Fruit. It was more like a seed that had
      vines growing out of it. The vines were purple and red, and they looked as
      if they had been drenched in blood.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen was shocked, and he thought to himself, &#8220;There really was
      something wrong. It was fortunate that I chose not to go; had I been the
      one to grab that fruit, that would have been me!&#8221;
    </p>

    <p>
      The super creatures all stared at the purple-red vine, and as they did,
      the vines moved. Instantly, the vines extended and shot out to grab the
      green kirin which was closest to it.
    </p>

    <p>
      The green kirin was as terrified as it was angry. Its body flashed green
      as it cast water arrows to strike the vines that grabbed it. But the vines
      had thorns growing along them, and they pierced through the kirin&#8217;s
      green scales with apparent ease. They wormed their way through its flesh
      and continued to drill their way inside.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen felt a chill run down his spine as he watched. It was unlike
      anything he had ever seen before, and it was so odd it felt surreal.
    </p>

    <p>
      Even though the other super creatures were frightened by what was
      happening, none of them were sure how they should react. They merely
      watched the vines drill their way into the kirin&#8217;s body.
    </p>

    <p>
      As the vines drilled in, the green scales of the kirin began to develop a
      purple pattern, as well. The more that pattern overtook it, the weaker its
      resistance to the vine was.
    </p>

    <p>Roar!</p>

    <p>
      As the green kirin continued to twitch in agony, they heard a roar. The
      black tiger was going for the griffin once more.
    </p>

    <p>
      On the other side of the peak, the black skeleton and the black-flame
      phoenix were starting to develop a purple pattern across their bodies,
      too. They stood up and made scary noises, and then attacked the creatures
      that were closest to them.
    </p>

    <p>
      It was chaos again, as the blood of super creatures began to drench the
      mountainside. The black skeleton and the black-flame phoenix were far more
      powerful right now, and they savagely destroyed any super creature they
      fought. With a misty red haze, the peak was doused in the color red.
    </p>

    <p>Roar!</p>

    <p>
      The green kirin stood up again, looking angry. Its body was covered in the
      phantom pattern by now, and it leapt over to the lime-green elephant. In
      between the splashes of lime, the kirin was able to tear into its back.
      With its ravenous mouth, it ripped open the flesh to expose the spine
      inside. Blood began to cascade from the wound.
    </p>

    <p>
      The other super creatures, which were currently free of attackers, all
      decided to escape the area. They all knew there was something wrong with
      the fruit they had previously been hungry for, and so they all thought it
      was best to book before something bad happened to them.
    </p>

    <p>
      The creatures that had been trapped were having difficulty committing to
      flight. This was especially true for the griffin, which would soon be
      killed by the merciless black tiger.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen&#8217;s heart went cold. It was all too strange, and he knew that
      he himself should run off now while he could.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;You can run, but you must make him stay.&#8221; The woman&#8217;s
      voice sung in Han Sen&#8217;s ears once more, and it made him shiver.
