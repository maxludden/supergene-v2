  For it to be related to the powers that governed reincarnation was something rather spooky.

Han Sen was still unable to figure out what the half-burned candle actually was. Even an Annihilation-class main god had no direct association with the processes of reincarnation. Plus, that half-burned candle was just a wild, evolved God Spirit gene race.

“What is the precise nature of this existence? Who was its master?” Han Sen wanted to immediately seek out Night God No Moon so he could ask about Mirror Moon’s history and power.

Although he had the Mirror Moon candle, Han Sen could not place Mirror Moon in his Sea of soul. Mirror Moon only agreed to follow him. It did not agree to become his gene race. “It is OK if I am at least able to bring it around with me. It does not matter if I cannot place it down in the Sea of soul.” Han Sen was chill about that fact. He just grabbed ahold of the half-burned candle and started to make his exit from the Candle Garden.

“No… Impossible…” The old man with white hair thought Han Sen would gain nothing. Who would have known Han Sen was able to hold the half-burned candle and leave the Candle Garden so simply?

Mirror Moon was not like the big, dark evil dragon king that meant a lot to the Qin Kingdom, but its history was just like the big, dark evil dragon king. It might have been even greater than it.

Night God No Moon had left a big mark on the Qin Kingdom. She left behind even more than even Qin Xiu. After all, Qin Xiu only made the Qin Kingdom shine for one generation.

Night God No More established the system of law. It made the Qin Kingdom shine all the way up until this day, saving it from being destroyed.

The Qin Kingdom had many ultimate elites to help it. That enabled it to experience and endure many crises without falling. It was all, more or less, related to the stability given by their system of law.

If this was not the case, why would so many of those elites help the Qin Kingdom if over half of them were not even from the Qin Kingdom? Why would they work to save the country? Mirror Moon, which was a half-burned candle, was not Night God No Moon’s gene race. Still, it had a big connection to Night God No Moon. Back in the day, Night God No Moon had only just set up her system of law. It had a lot of trouble getting off the ground and even led to a lot of inner conflicts in the kingdom. One law cost 10,000 lives. Every law that was made involved many lives. It was like a river of blood was formed.

When the new laws were pushed to their most trying times, the king suddenly died. The nobles who opposed the new laws used that chance to attack Night God No Moon’s people, who wanted to follow the law and order. They said things like “The new laws make the God Spirits mad, and that is why the king died. If they continue using the new system of law, which goes against the sky, the Qin Kingdom will be punished by the sky and destroyed one day.”

The voices of those against grew louder when the king died. They could not be quelled. The efforts and blood that had been spent on creating the laws to that point were on the cusp of being wasted.

At that time, Night God No Moon borrowed Mirror Moon. With the power of that half-burned candle, they broke the system of reincarnation and brought the king back to life. After that, things took a turn. The new system of law succeeded.

That was all very scary. The king made an order to keep silent about his revival. The officers who knew about the king coming back to life were all dead. Even amidst the royals, no one talked about that.

The legends about Mirror Moon, the half-burned candle, bringing the king back to life were well-known. Although the royals did not dare speak about it, many people looked for Mirror Moon.

After Night God No Moon vanished, many royals tried to claim Mirror Moon. The old man with white hair was one of them, but he had failed.

The half-burned candle, Mirror Moon, was left sitting in the Qin Kingdom’s Candle Garden. Only God knew how many billions of years later had passed. Now, Han Sen had been easily able to take the half-burned candle out of Candle Garden. Qin Yuan did not object to Han Sen going to Candle Garden because he did not believe Han Sen had what it took to take Mirror Moon. Even the Qin family’s Break World elites could not much such a candle. Besides, Han Sen was just a human outsider.

He had not expected that Han Sen would really be able to bring the Mirror Moon candle away. Qin Yuan could not just sit back and watch as this happened. It was a powerful item that could go against the sky. Even if the Qin family could not use it, he did not want to allow it to be used by an outsider.

Qin Yuan’s eyes looked very deep. He teleported through space and stared at the Mirror Moon candle in Han Sen’s hands. His eyes turned bright as he said, “He did not take the Mirror Moon candle completely. I am not sure what method he used to have the Mirror Moon candle let him bring it out of Candle Garden.”

If Han Sen had already taken Mirror Moon, Qin Yuan would have been very worried. He was worried that Mirror Moon had a mysterious power. Otherwise, he would not have had to stop Han Sen.

He now realized that Han Sen could not actually take the Mirror Moon candle. This delighted him. He jumped away, going across a lot of space to enter the Candle Garden.

Han Sen was holding the half-burned candle on his way out of the garden. The officer who led Han Sen there was still waiting for him outside. When he saw Han Sen bring the half-burned candle out, the officer was shocked.

He did not know the history of Mirror Moon, but he had seen many kings enter Candle Garden and exit with a destroyed look on their faces. Everyone had always returned from that place empty-handed.

Upon seeing that Han Sen had the half-burned candle in his hands and was now walking out fine, how could anyone not be shocked?

The officer went up to him and bowed. “Congratulations, Mister Han. You really are so strong. I have served three generations, and I have seen many people enter the Candle Garden. I have never seen anyone bring anything out with them from that place. You are the only one who has been able to do this, Mister Han.”

Han Sen wished to say something, but he suddenly saw a shadow come before him. It blocked his way.

When he saw that shadow, the officer felt his body tremor and quake. He quickly kneeled. With a trembling voice, he said, “Greetings, Old Alpha.”

Qin Yuan ignored the officer. He looked at Han Sen and coldly said, “Put Mirror Moon down. This is not some item you can randomly take away.”

“Really? The king told me that if I was able to take it that it belongs to me.” Han Sen was not angry, but he did speak coldly.

“Jing Zhen’s sickness has not yet been healed. His mind is still a bit messed up. You cannot take his words seriously.” Qin Yuan took a step forward. His power was like a mountain or rushing tsunami. He wanted Han Sen to bend.

“Are you saying the Qin Kingdom’s king’s brain is broken?” Han Sen directly asked. “You are talking like a fart.”

“Nonsense! I think you have no idea that you are going to die today.” Qin Yuan’s power grew stronger. The scary presence turned into a pair of eyes that had a fire inside. He was going for Han Sen as if he wanted to burn him to dust.

“Isn’t that what you meant?” Han Sen coldly asked.

“What if it was? Jing Zhen is my heir. His grandfather’s grandfather called me Great-Grandfather. I am an elder. So, what if I speak the truth?” Qin Yuan looked very overbearing. His body raged with fire. “I already know one elder of the Qin family,” Han Sen coldly said. “She calls me Big Brother. If we are talking about who the oldest is, you should call me the great-, great-, great-, great-granduncle or something. I say it is your brain that has a problem. As an elder, I can say that to you, right?”
