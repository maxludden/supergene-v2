<p>“Can you tell that quickly?” Yan Dan asked with an evil smile.
“Your feelings are certainly quite sensitive, but we are old
friends. Therefore, you are free to guess who I am.”</p>
<p>“Rocky Dee,” Han Sen said with a frown.</p>
<p>“Your feelings are very accurate, but you have only guessed it
partially correct,” Yan Dan said. “Right now, I am Rocky Dee and
Yan Dan. He waved his hand. The Flying Yan Spears returned to his
hands. The spears had a demon-like flame wreathing all around them.
The flames were greater than before.</p>
<p>One spear was held in front of his chest, and one spear was
pointing at Han Sen. Yan Dan looked like his eyes were on fire as
he said, “Come on, fight me. Let us see just how strong you are.
Stop using those small tricks of yours to trick people. My heart is
like the heart of a god or a demon. Even with a thousand moves, I
will not slip and create a single flaw. The powers of your sword
are useless to me.”</p>
<p>After that, one of the short spears in Yan Dan’s hands came
thrusting toward Han Sen. The short spear looked like a Flying Yan.
It ripped through space and disappeared.</p>
<p>Chi!</p>
<p>Han Sen’s body retreated. The Flying Yan Spear went right past
his cheek. It scraped the skin on his face, leaving a small red
mark behind.</p>
<p>“The powers of a God Spirit are very interesting,” Yan Dan said
with a laugh. He then took out the other short spear.</p>
<p>Two shorts spears turned into Flying Yans. They disappeared from
the zone of space around Han Sen. They were transparent. It looked
like they were going to attack Han Sen.</p>
<p>Han Sen frowned a little. He was good at teleporting. He might
have even been a master at it, but the powers of Empty God did not
solely rely on teleportation. Its powers turned bodies into
nothingness.</p>
<p>Teleporting required breaking space. It was a movement in space
that allowed Han Sen to predict where the Flying Yan Spears would
come out.</p>
<p>Empty God’s powers did not require someone to rip space. It was
like two Flying Yan Spears went invisible in front of Han Sen. He
was unable to their presence or movement.</p>
<p>Even if Han Sen used his powers, he could still not feel the
presence of the two short spears.</p>
<p>Han Sen was fighting two enemies he could not see. Until his
body was it by a Flying Yan Spear, he could not react.</p>
<p>No matter how fast Han Sen’s reaction was, he was one step too
late. If it was not for his body being very strong, the Flying Yan
Spears would have killed him. He would have likely had his head
chopped off.</p>
<p>“The Empty God powers are very interesting.” Yan Dan looked at
Han Sen, who was continuing to be hurt by the Flying Yan Spears. He
laughed and said, “It looks like you cannot do anything to deny
this power.”</p>
<p>Han Sen did not answer. He was still trying to feel where the
Flying Yan Spears were, but he kept failing every time.</p>
<p>“Who cares if you have powers that can break the world?” Yan Dan
asked. “You cannot sense where the Flying Yan Spears are. Even
though you have enough power to destroy everything, you do not know
where they are. Having all that power is useless.”</p>
<p>Han Sen ignored him, but he was incurring more and more
wounds.</p>
<p>“Is San Mu going to be OK?” Feng Yin Yin worriedly asked.</p>
<p>Bao’er licked her lips and replied, “It is fine. My daddy just
needs to figure out the Empty God’s powers. Otherwise, he would
have killed the two Yans already.”</p>
<p>Just as Bao’er said, Han Sen wanted to figure out the Empty
God’s powers. Dealing with two Flying Yan Spears was not difficult
for him, but Empty God power was a bit weird. It was able to
prohibit him from sensing the movement of the power. If he met it
again, there would be no way to counter it.</p>
<p>Han Sen had to figure out how to overcome the Empty God powers.
That was why he kept allowing the Flying Yan Spears to attack
him.</p>
<p>“It is no wonder this is Empty God’s sacrifice. Even elites like
Dollar cannot do anything about it. If this keeps going on, Dollar
will be killed.”</p>
<p>“I do not think so. Did you not see that Dollar has only been
slightly wounded? I believe he has found a way to break it.”</p>
<p>“Speaking of that, Dollar is really strong, isn’t he?
Sacrificial items like the Flying Yan Spears with three ultimate
gene race buffs have only been able to damage his skin a bit.”</p>
<p>“No matter how strong he is, it doesn’t matter. Even if it takes
a long time, repeatedly getting hit will eventually result in his
death. He will lose.”</p>
<p>Yan Bei Fei was a bit worried. Yan Dan had combined with another
creature’s soul, which was forbidden. He was worried about what
might happen to Yan Dan after this fight and the aftermath of his
actions.</p>
<p>Chi!</p>
<p>There was another armor-cracking noise. Han Sen’s blood god
dragon and combined protection scales armor was cracked by the
Flying Yan Spears.</p>
<p>“I see it!” Han Sen cared little for the injuries he had
sustained. He took a deep breath. It was as if he had sorted out
all of his confusion.</p>
<p>“Are you going to give up?” Yan Dan saw that Han Sen had
stopped. He stopped dodging the Flying Yan Spears’ attack and
frowned.</p>
<p>In the next second, Han Sen’s hands suddenly moved. It was so
fast that one could not even follow where it went. The two Flying
Yan Spears were being held in his hands.</p>
<p>The Flying Yan Spears buzzed in his hands. They were going to
break space and leave, but Han Sen held onto them tightly. The
weapons were unable to break free and escape.</p>
<p>Yan Dan clapped his hands and said, “That is very powerful. You
can grab the Flying Yan Spears that contain Empty God power. I must
say that is very impressive.” His mood did not change just because
his spears were being controlled.</p>
<p>“It is a shame that grabbing them is a useless waste of your
effort,” Yan Dan said. “Don’t you know that these are god
sacrifices? Only God Spirits or God Spirit inheritors can use them.
Even in your hands, they still possess what it takes to kill you.”
His three powers started to blaze as they became Empty God powers
burning all around him.</p>
<p>The Flying Yan Spears’ powers exploded. A scary power made the
tools escape Han Sen’s hands. They were going to fly into his
chest, which was very close to them.</p>
<p>When the two spears left Han Sen’s hands, they disappeared into
space. He knew they were going toward his chest, but he could not
feel them or see them.</p>
<p>“Blood god dragon is a bit bad.” Han Sen did not move. He cast
the Xuan Yellow Sutra and Blood-Pulse Sutra at the same time and
entered break-world mode.</p>
<p>The moment his chest felt pain, Han Sen’s hands broke space. He
suddenly grabbed the Flying Yan Spears.</p>
<p>He did not need to waste time thinking. The power in Han Sen’s
body was greater and faster than he gave himself credit for. The
direction of his body enabled him to grab the two spears while they
were coming toward him.</p>
<p>This time, Yan Dan was really shocked. “This is a scary guy.
Does he have a battle power that is this immense? In this universe,
when it comes to the battle power of the body, you are the best! It
is a shame that in this world, there is more than one way to fight.
Using your body to fight is the most stupid thing.”</p>
<p>After that, Yan Dan pulled in the space around him. The rip
space nine-rob Yan power turned into a bow, and the demon-eyed
unicorn snake power turned into an arrow.</p>
<p>Yan Dan pulled the bowstring as far back as he could. God light
exploded as the arrow was released. It turned the arrow into a
light that was soaring toward Han Sen.</p>
