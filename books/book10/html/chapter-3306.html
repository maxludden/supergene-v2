<p>“I do not know how it has managed to break the world. If we are
unable to kill it, Space Garden will be in big danger.” Gu
Qingcheng was holding her greatsword. She pointed it at the star
tyrannosaurus rex. Her sword mind kept rising.</p>
<p>Huangfu Jing did not speak. She flashed next to the star
tyrannosaurus rex and moved quickly. She was like a war machine
attacking the star tyrannosaurus rex from different angles.</p>
<p>Because she teleported so fast, it looked like there were many
of her attacking the star tyrannosaurus rex from many different
angles.</p>
<p>Knee, elbow, leg, palm, fist, finger, and all kinds of raging
power struck the star tyrannosaurus rex. Huangfu Jing’s bones were
going to crack, but all her different attacks were unable to break
the star tyrannosaurus rex’s defenses.</p>
<p>Roar!</p>
<p>Gu Qingcheng and a few people were about to save them when they
suddenly heard a roaring sound come out of the bushes. A snow-white
tiger with four wings came soaring forth. It was another Break
World creature.</p>
<p>Gu Qingcheng’s and Lin Feng’s expressions changed. There were
already two Break World creatures there. They did not know how many
Break World creatures might have been prowling around Space
Garden.</p>
<p>Such scary existences were frightening. Just one of them had
proven disastrous. They could not imagine the carnage to transpire
if there were a few more of those things showing up, or what kind
of damage they would do to Space Garden.</p>
<p>In fact, Space Garden had more than two Break World beasts.
Although the life souls had randomly entered the universe, they
chose which creatures to take control of. They picked the most
powerful life forces they could. That was especially so when it
came to selecting xenogeneics. They were the type of creatures that
attracted life souls.</p>
<p>Space Garden had many, many big xenogeneics. They drew many life
souls that were around. It made many xenogeneics suddenly
mutate.</p>
<p>The success rate of life souls and xenogeneics combining was
still fairly low. Out of 10 life souls, only one could successfully
combine. While that was a low figure, one was scary enough.</p>
<p>Ji Yanran was fighting an earl-class xenogeneic. She wanted to
practice her power when she suddenly saw a mountain come crumbling
down like a breaking wave from the sea. A big red snake, which was
3– feet long, suddenly emerged. Its eyes burned with a red flame.
It looked at Ling’er, who was behind Ji Yanran.</p>
<p>Boom!</p>
<p>A blood flame fired out. It turned into a sky full of fire sea
heading for Ji Yanran and Ling’er.</p>
<p>Ji Yanran’s body moved. She fell back. The sea of fire that
faced them was too much to handle. With her speed, she was unable
to avoid the radius of the sea of fire.</p>
<p>Ji Yanran had to gather up power. She slashed at the sea of
fire, but the power on the knife was melted by the bloody fires.
The knife in her hand turned into steel juice.</p>
<p>Ji Yanran’s hand was burned by the fire. The mother and the
daughter were on the cusp of being swallowed by the bloody
fires.</p>
<p>“Damn it!” Ling’er screamed. Her body was wrapped in white fire.
Her entire body was like a spirit body. She released a very
powerful spirit body to create white light. It shielded the mother
and daughter.</p>
<p>The blood fire landed on the shield, but it was unable to break
its defense.</p>
<p>Ling’er’s body floated. She pointed at the big red snake and
madly said, “You annoying little worm! How dare you hurt my mother!
You have made me very mad!”</p>
<p>“You little bug! So, what? Who cares if you’re mad?” The blood
snake spoke the human language in response. Its scary snakehead
looked like it had the face of a human. It looked like a
human-faced snake.</p>
<p>Ling’er looked at the bloody big snake and said, “I am going to
beat you.”</p>
<p>“Ha! Ha! In that case, come at me,” the bloody big snake said.
Its bloody fires exploded again. It was burned by the blood flames
around, conjuring a sea of blood.</p>
<p>A tornado-like bloody fire came out of the big snake’s human
face. It was going toward Ling’er and Ji Yanran.</p>
<p>“Ling’er, be careful!” Ji Yanran wanted to grab Ling’er, who was
floating in the air.</p>
<p>Ling’er’s body flashed. She went toward the bloody fire
tornado.</p>
<p>Pang!</p>
<p>The bloody fire tornado broke Ling’er’s fist. The white
light-looking small fist hit the human face snakehead. The human
face snake made a wretched scream.</p>
<p>The scream barely sounded and suddenly stopped. Its body looked
like it had been melted by the sun. It turned into nothing and
faded into the haze of a white shadow. A red crystal that looked
like an eye fell.</p>
<p>Ji Yanran opened her mouth wide as she stared at Ling’er.
Although she knew Ling’er had inherited Han Sen’s body and would be
very strong, it was still hard for her to believe a mad Ling’er
could be that strong.</p>
<p>In fact, Ling’er was born with a Super God Spirit mode. She was
no worse than Han Sen before his Super God Spirit mode broke the
world. Plus, that human face snake had just combined with a life
soul, so its Break World rate was bound to be low. It was not yet
used to wielding Break World powers. That was how Ling’er had been
able to slay the beast.</p>
<p>“Mom, are you OK?” Ling’er looked how she did earlier. She
returned to Ji Yanran.</p>
<p>“I am fine.” Ji Yanran shook her head, but she looked serious as
she said, “We have to go back to the base.”</p>
<p>Inside Outer Sky, many scary creatures combining with life
souls. Littleflower, Xie Qing King, and the others were fighting
them. They were having a difficult time.</p>
<p>Xie Qing King was shining with a silver light. He was madly
fighting a big ape. His fist and the big ape’s fist collided.
Neither of them fell, but the big ape was brave. It also had a lot
more power. Although Xie Qing King stood straight and did not fall
back, the ground around his feet started to break. His fists bled.
There was blood above his fists. The bones inside his hands were
visible. It looked like the bones were going to break.</p>
<p>Tang Zhen Liu was having a bad fight too. He was with Yi Dong
Mu, Snowball, and Little Star. They were fighting a weird bug man.
The bug man was extremely fast ad could dodge all of their
attacks.</p>
<p>The bug man’s sharp claws were like blades. While it was
flashing, his body left many marks on them.</p>
<p>The universe was having crazy fights everywhere. It was not just
the geno universe experiencing this. Even the universe of kingdoms
was suffering this kind of turmoil.</p>
<p>In the Extreme King, an evil bird with four talons was engaged
in a fight. Everywhere it went, it left pieces like sharp blades.
The inside of the kingdom was little more than a mess. Mountains
and buildings were ripped open. The blades in the ground were like
trenches.</p>
<p>God only knew how many Extreme King people had suddenly been
killed. The blood dyed the land red as cries and screams erupted
everywhere. It was like a living hell.</p>
<p>“God, save my son. I am willing to do anything!” An old woman
with white hair was holding a young man whose leg had been cut off.
He was bleeding everywhere. She was screaming.</p>
<p>A body emerged from the shadows. It was like a sky god
descending. He looked at the Extreme King woman who was begging and
coldly said, “I am the god that controls time. I can do as you
wish, but do not forget your promise.”</p>
