The truth was, the attack wasn’t as annoying as everyone thought. Han Sen’s super king spirit mode could suppress and immunize all negative feelings of oneself. This included Heart Sword, Sonic Sword, Sky Sword, and Spirit Sword. None of those would work on Han Sen in super king spirit mode.

Others were in fear, seeing all those sword skills fail. To Han Sen, it was nothing spectacular.

Han Sen was familiar with Six Paths’ sword skills. He knew the only skills that could threaten him were Blood Sword and Life Sword. With those conning next, the real fight was only just beginning.

Six Paths noticed Han Sen’s body change. The three sword skills he used already did not work on Han Sen, but he now looked calm.

People who knew Six Paths knew what his calmness suggested.

People that had finesse with the sword knew it was best not to wield such a weapon with jittery excitement. And when Six Paths saw an opponent that impressed him, he’d often get excited. But when Six Paths saw an opponent that could be considered his rival, he always became calmer instead. He’d don the look of a proper swordsman.

The sword in Six Paths’ hand did not move. His face started to look red, as if his blood was boiling on the inside. It made people think he was a volcano that could erupt at a moment’s notice.

But his eyes were a contrast to that look. They seemed extremely calm, holding neither sadness or happiness.

Han Sen looked dim now. He knew the real fight was only just beginning, too. With Six Paths’ Blood Sword coming up, Han Sen knew he could no longer rely on tricks. He had to fight properly.

Han Sen took a deep breath and let the energy course through his entire body and run on a cycle.

Yin Yang Blast with twice the cycle allowed Han Sen to finely control both Yin and Yang. Han Sen had learned many different skills, and aside from sword skills, Yin Yang Blast was still something he frequently used. It was originally taught to him by Bai Yishan.

It was a dangerous hyper geno art, though. The results could either be heaven or hell. If he used it well, it could prove to be the strongest hyper geno art one could use. But if it was used poorly, Han Sen could damage himself badly.

Yin Yang Blast was banned in the Alliance due to its power and volatility, despite the ease of learning.

The sword was like a bird flying low at Han Sen. The violence was coming fast and quiet. It was impressive enough just to watch. Even if you did not know how to use a sword, you could tell how accurate it was. You could tell how fast and steady it was coming.

Han Sen did not have a sword, but even if he did, he wouldn’t use it against Six Paths. Although Han Sen’s sword skills were no weaker than Six Paths’ techniques, if they fought sword-to-sword, Han Sen only had a 40% chance of winning.

Han Sen was good with sword skills, but the sword was more of a tool for him. If he used a spear or a knife, it was all very similar to him.

But to Six Paths, a sword was a sword. And there was no comparison to anything else.

Facing Six Paths and his sword skills, Han Sen did not dodge. He did not have Sword Heart, but he still had the inherent will to fight. It did not make much of a difference whether he had a sword or not. He wanted to win just as much, either way.

Han Sen flicked his finger, unleashing a Yin Yang Blast of power at Six Paths’ sword. The sword went three inches off- course.

Six Paths’ Sword Heart remained calm, but his sword skills were like a volcano or a tsunami.

Fast, faster.

Hard, harder.

Accurate, more accurate.

Steady, steadier.

Six Paths Sword was harder than ever. It was crazier than ever, too. By the end, you couldn’t even see Six Paths’ sword nor his body. All you could see was a swordlight flickering around Han Sen. It left swordmarks everywhere.

Han Sen was in the arena, but his arms moved blindingly fast with all ten fingers flicking in different directions. You could hear the sword and fingers colliding against each other repeatedly. It happened so many times, it was impossible to keep an accurate count of how many times they had hit each other.

Everyone stopped breathing. It was like if you stopped to blink, you’d miss an insane match. You wouldn’t want to waste a single second.

So many creatures were in the stadium, watching, but still, it was all deathly quiet. The only thing that could be heard was the sound of the fighters striking.

“Powerful sword skill meets a powerful plan,” Furnace Emperor said with a sigh.

Xu Mi, who was next to him, looked confused. “Father, what plan?”

Xu Mi could tell Six Paths was strong, but he was not sure why Furnace Emperor said plan.

Furnace Emperor sighed again and said, “Dollar’s skills aren’t special. He has calculated his strength, and Six Paths sword skills are in fact stronger. If I fought against him, I know I’d lose worse. But sword skills require an accurate judgment of strength. Stabbing and slashing can change the entire direction of a fight. Dollar can see through Six Paths’ sword skill and the fingers keep flicking to where they need to be. It looks very dangerous, but it isn’t”

“Does that mean Dollar knows the weaknesses of Six Paths’ sword skills?” Xu Mi asked.

“No, it does not. There are no invisible powers or factors here. If you want a sword that is very hard, it will lack flexibility. That is not a flaw, that is just how things are. Dollar uses the right strength for the right situation,” Furnace said.

Xu Mi looked as if he understood, but he didn’t. Then, he asked, “I still don’t understand. What’s the difference between that and weaknesses?”

Furnace Emperor, with a wry smile, shook his head. “I don’t know. I can tell Six Paths’ sword skills are strong, but Dollar sees right through them.”

Many elites discussed the battle between Han Sen and Six Paths.

“Dollar is straddling the edge of a knife. If he slips up, he’ll be killed by Six Paths Sword,” the Outer Sky leader said, looking at Battle God.

“Strange. Dollar seems to know Six Paths’ sword skills. Otherwise, how could he make the correct judgment of Six Paths’ constantly changing moveset?” The Sacred leader looked suspicious.

“Demigod Gu, what is happening now?” Wang Yuhang could not see the fight, so he asked Gu Qingcheng.

“Something dangerous.” Gu Qingcheng frowned.
