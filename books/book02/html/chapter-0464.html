    <p>
      Han Sen did not know what was wrong with the nine-life cat or why it would
      suddenly react so strangely. However, undoubtedly, the change was
      definitely related to the Crystallizer ruin. However, Han Sen did not know
      what the connection between the nine-life cat and the Crystallizer ruin
      was.
    </p>

    <p>
      Daphne landed on the Crystallizer ruin and made a comprehensive scan and
      analysis of the planet. Same to other Crystallizer ruins, only the surface
      of the planet could be scanned by human equipment. The inner space of the
      Crystallizer architectures was unknown to people. The analysis of air and
      water showed the planet was normal, habitable according to human
      standards. Other Crystallizer ruins were mostly the same, so nothing was
      special about this one.
    </p>

    <p>
      After some preparation, the expert panel, warframe department, explosion
      department, and marines took their equipment and left the warship,
      beginning their exploration.
    </p>

    <p>
      When the work began, everyone was banned from entering God&#8217;s
      Sanctuary again. Since the cookhouse did not need to go to the field, Han
      Sen felt quite bored every day.
    </p>

    <p>
      However, since most people on the warship had already landed on the
      planet, he and Ji Yanran could see each other secretly quite often.
    </p>

    <p>
      Chen Shoushan went to the field together with the expert panel, while Ji
      Yanran was responsible for staying on Daphne. She actually had nothing to
      do other than receiving reports sent by Chen Shoushan and the expert
      panel.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Such a huge planet! We have only these people. How long would it
      take for us to finish the work if we look into one architecture after
      another? I don&#8217;t think we could finish it in a century.&#8221; Han
      Sen felt quite upset when watching the field recordings in Ji
      Yanran&#8217;s office.
    </p>

    <p>
      If this went on forever, he would probably stay here for his entire
      service.
    </p>

    <p>
      Ji Yanran smiled and said, &#8220;Who would be so dumb to discover one
      after another? That way, with these people, it would take us five hundred
      to a thousand years to finish 1% of the work.&#8221;
    </p>

    <p>
      Ji Yanran paused and then continued, &#8220;Crystallizers had different
      ranks. Their architectures follow a certain rule. As long as we find one
      entrance, we could access their treasure. All we are looking for is their
      crystals.&#8221;
    </p>

    <p>&#8220;It sounds easy enough,&#8221; Han Sen said.</p>

    <p>
      &#8220;It is not easy at all. Since the device could not scan the internal
      structure of the architectures, we must rely on the experts specialized in
      Crystallizer civilization to find the right entrance.&#8221;
    </p>

    <p>&#8220;Can&#8217;t we just blast it away?&#8221; Han Sen asked.</p>

    <p>
      &#8220;The crystal material of their architectures is very unique. Not
      only is it tough, but it will also expand once blasted. At that time, the
      internal space would be completely blocked, which would make the
      excavation work even harder.&#8221;
    </p>

    <p>
      Ji Yanran drank some water and continued, &#8220;This is not the real
      problem though. Since the experts and professors are here, the entrance
      could always be located sooner or later. However, if the Crystallizer ruin
      is still working, that will truly be challenging.&#8221;
    </p>

    <p>
      As Han Sen was about to ask what kind of challenge there could be, he
      suddenly heard an explosion. Looking at the live recordings of the field,
      Han Sen saw a red crystal the size of a fist floating next to a crystal
      wall. The crystal blinked with red light twice and something weird
      happened.
    </p>

    <p>
      The red crystal quickly expanded and changed its form, turning into the
      same vehicle as the multifunction excavator that was doing the fieldwork.
      It quickly rushed toward the original excavator.
    </p>

    <p>Bang bang!</p>

    <p>
      It only took two blows for the crystal excavator to smash the one it
      imitated. The crystal vehicle headed toward the excavation team.
    </p>

    <p>
      The soldiers in warframe department quickly turned on their warframes and
      charged the crystal excavator. Because they did not want to damage the
      architectures, they refrained from using massive weapons, with only laser
      guns and swords in their hands.
    </p>

    <p>
      Luckily, the red crystal only imitated a multifunction excavator, so it
      was soon shot down into pieces, turning into a pool of red liquid that
      then evaporated.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;It seems that we are out of luck. This Crystallizer ruin is still
      operating. I&#8217;m afraid this task would not be completed that
      easily.&#8221; Ji Yanran said with a wry smile.
    </p>

    <p>&#8220;What is that?&#8221; Han Sen was shocked.</p>

    <p>
      &#8220;It is a defense crystal of Crystallizers. The Alliance calls it a
      simulating crystal. Once scanned by it, it could imitate the shape of
      anything including mechanics and creatures. However, its texture will
      still be the same red crystal, so the simulation was not complete,&#8221;
      explained Ji Yanran.
    </p>

    <p>&#8220;What an amazing civilization,&#8221; Han Sen complimented.</p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Very amazing and very dangerous. There are many deadly Crystallizer
      technologies that we don&#8217;t even know about…&#8221;
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;We found it… We found the entrance…&#8221; A surprised voice
      suddenly came from the live recordings.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen and Ji Yanran quickly looked at the footage and saw Chen Shoushan
      and several professors standing in front of an excavated architecture,
      looking inside, full of surprise.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;It seems everything is going smooth. I hope we could locate the
      treasure soon.&#8221; Ji Yanran felt slightly relieved.
    </p>

    <p>
      However, in the next moment, the holographic image suddenly broke off. Ji
      Yanran quickly contacted Chen Shoushan and the rest using comlink, but
      there was no answer.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Something&#8217;s wrong.&#8221; Ji Yanran suddenly became pale and
      summoned all the officers on the warship.
    </p>

    <p>
      The communications team was trying to reach people in the field. However,
      they were completely out of touch as if they had disappeared.
    </p>

    <p>
      There were not a lot of people stationing on Daphne to begin with, so even
      the cookhouse was summoned. Including the medical team, the repair team
      and the cookhouse, there were only less than forty people.
    </p>

    <p>
      No communications were available, and people could see some equipment left
      on the surface through radar. All the humans were gone. And nothing could
      be seen inside.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Captain, shall we go back and call for reinforcement?&#8221; An
      officer hesitated and asked.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;We must figure out what&#8217;s happening first,&#8221; Ji Yanran
      said with her brows knitted.
    </p>

    <p>
      Several top experts and scholars specialized in Crystallizer civilization
      were in the field. If they were gone for no reasons, Ji Yanran would be
      facing harsh sanction if she returned without figuring out why. She might
      even be sent to the military court. In addition, many officers and
      soldiers including Chen Shoushan were also on the planet, so Ji Yanran
      should not go back before taking a look.
    </p>

    <p>
      However, people who were staying on the warship were mostly noncombatants
      including officers in charge of ship operation, medicine, and cooking.
      There were very few people that could be deployed.
    </p>

    <p>
      Ji Yanran reviewed all the talents she got on hand and gritted her teeth.
      &#8220;I ask for five soldiers who is good at warframe operation to follow
      me to the field, figuring out what is happening.&#8221;
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;I&#8217;m rather good at warframe. Let me follow you,&#8221; Han
      Sen said quickly.
    </p>

    <p>
      Naturally, he could not stay on the ship while letting Ji Yanran risk her
      life. In addition, he wanted to figure out why the nine-life cat pendant
      would react to the Crystallizer ruin.
