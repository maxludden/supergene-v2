<p>God smiled at Han Sen as it asked, “Can we agree to a bet
now?”</p>
<p>Han Sen could not speak. He felt as if he was going to be
strangled to death, so he had to nod.</p>
<p>“Nice. You have made the right choice. Using your power is more
interesting.” God laughed.</p>
<p>“Should it be me who is deciding what to risk?” Han Sen rubbed
his throat. He realized now that this god was a bit evil. It seemed
very casual, but it was scarier than the other gods he had
encountered. It gave Han Sen real pressure, and it was exerting a
sense of danger the other gods had not been able to accomplish.</p>
<p>“Before, it really did not matter,” God said. “Now, I have met a
really interesting creature like you. That is why I want to play my
favorite game.”</p>
<p>“What game is that?” Han Sen’s brain moved fast. His only option
was to escape. He could not defeat this god. Even if he could beat
this god, the god had taken over Wan’er’s body. He could not risk
killing Wan’er along with it.</p>
<p>Also, the black crystal armor had strangely hidden itself. That
had never happened before. When he used to meet the kings, he had
not seen the black crystal armor react like this. That just showed
how scary this god truly was.</p>
<p>Han Sen thought gods like the kings would not deal damage to
creatures in the universe. Gods like Evil Lotus God, which could
hit creatures, were not his enemy. He used Sky Vine Radish and his
phoenix feather to establish a tie.</p>
<p>This god was totally different. It was possessing Wan’er and
still able to wield massive power. It was clearly a god spirit
operating on a whole new level.</p>
<p>This god… Is it the one that met the seventh team? Han Sen
wondered.</p>
<p>“It is so simple. We will predict the fate of each other.” God’s
face looked so weird but only for a second.</p>
<p>“Predict fate? Predict whose fate?” Han Sen asked with a
frown.</p>
<p>“It can be anybody. You can pick any creature you want,” God
said. It then moved its hand. God light turned into a mirror. The
mirror had many shadows. There were all kinds of creatures from the
universe there.</p>
<p>“I don’t like altering the fates of others,” Han Sen said. “You
can come and test my fate, but how will you even predict it, and
how will you win?”</p>
<p>“We are just making a bet,” God coldly said. “We cannot bet on
ourselves. You pick a creature. It can be anyone you know. It can
even be your family. We will predict the choices they make when
something happens. You can decide first.”</p>
<p>“Then, I select the Very High’s leader,” Han Sen said. He was
thinking, No matter how strong you are, you cannot affect the Very
High’s leader.</p>
<p>It was unknown if God saw what Han Sen was thinking, but it did
not care and said, “Yeah, let’s bet with Very High Leader.”</p>
<p>“How do we bet?” Han Sen asked. “It is not as if we know what
the Very High Leader is going to do.”</p>
<p>God did not speak. It walked one step and came before Han Sen.
It pulled Han Sen with him. Han Sen felt as if he fell into a time
vortex. He felt so dizzy that he thought he was going to throw
up.</p>
<p>Many people had carried him away via Galaxy Teleport. He had
almost finished practicing Galaxy Teleport himself, but it was
never this horrible.</p>
<p>When everything returned to normal, Han Sen found himself in
Outer Sky. In front of him was the very familiar Star Tree.</p>
<p>The Star Tree was full of fruit. They looked like many giant
planets hanging from the branches of the tree.</p>
<p>A young man of the Very High was sitting under the Star Tree
with his legs crossed. The man’s white clothing was like snow. He
looked very handsome and also very cold. He looked like a guy who
everybody owed money to.</p>
<p>This man… He looks very familiar… Han Sen thought that the young
man looked very familiar.</p>
<p>“This is Very High Leader,” God said next to him.</p>
<p>“You are lying. I have seen Very High Leader, and he is an old
man.” Before Han Sen could finish, his face changed. He suddenly
knew why the young man looked so familiar. His facial structure and
body looked like Very High Leader. He just looked younger, so he
seemed different.</p>
<p>God smiled and said, “That is Very High Leader when he was
young. We are here when he was only 20.”</p>
<p>“We… We went into the past…” Han Sen’s face changed. He finally
understood why it was so difficult to teleport. It was not because
he had not just used Galaxy Teleport. He had teleported through
time.</p>
<p>“There is nothing amazing about it,” God casually said. “If you
want, I can take you to see what you looked like when you were
younger.”</p>
<p>“That is fine,” Han Sen said. “The past is the past. Whatever
happens in the future is always meant to be. If you already know
how things pan out, what is the point of making a bet?”</p>
<p>“Who told you the future is already set in stone?” God looked at
Han Sen with shock.</p>
<p>“Is it not?” Han Sen asked with a smile. “If the future could be
changed, you could just go and kill the Very High’s leader now.
With the power you have, Very High Leader will obey you. We do not
have to go to the past and find the Very High’s leader.”</p>
<p>God preferred spending its power on going back to the past than
going to meet Very High Leader. Clearly, it was afraid of
something, which was why Han Sen said what he did.</p>
<p>God laughed and said, “There are rules in this universe. Even
God cannot destroy them. But within these rules, there is nothing
in there about changing the future. The future is full of
unpredictabilities. We come from a change in the future. Now, there
is some accident affecting it. It might create another future, so
we are not sure what the future is going to be.”</p>
<p>“Are you saying that you can affect the young Very High Leader
and make him do decisions that benefit you?” Han Sen knew what God
was trying to say.</p>
<p>“You can do the same too. That is only fair.” God laughed.</p>
<p>Han Sen looked at God seriously and asked, “Can I ask you a
question?”</p>
<p>“It depends on what you ask me,” God replied with a smile. “I
might be God, but I do not know the answer to everything.”</p>
<p>Han Sen looked at God seriously. It looked different from the
other king gods.</p>
<p>“If you like this game of yours so much, you must have played it
many times.” Han Sen took a deep breath as he asked, “Did you ever
lose?”</p>
<p>“Yes, I have lost twice.” God’s answer surprised Han Sen.</p>
<p>“I am curious as to who defeated you,” Han Sen said with
shock.</p>
<p>“One from Sacred and a human called Han Jingzhi,” God coldly
said. His face looked weird as he spoke.</p>
<p>When Han Sen heard that, his heart began to race like crazy. He
almost shouted out loud, “Han Jingzhi…”</p>
