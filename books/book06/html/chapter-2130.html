<h2>Dismantling Coin</h2>
<h3>Chapter 2130</h3>

<p>The surface of the bronze scroll flashed, showing two fighters
who appeared amidst the dunes of a desert. One was clad in a suit
of gold armor, whereas the other was garbed in white and purple
armor. Their body shapes were remarkably similar.</p>
<p>This is it, it’s going to start!” Everyone felt a great deal of
relief in their hearts. After what happened with the no-show Lone
Bamboo, many Nobles feared the same issue might plague the
anticipated finale.</p>
<p>Evil Eye looked at Han Sen with a great deal of interest, and he
asked, “What race do you actually belong to?”</p>
<p>“Human,” Han Sen answered calmly. He peered right back at Evil
Eye.</p>
<p>That man was shrouded by darkness as deep as the abyss itself,
but somehow, Han Sen was struck with a strange pang of familiarity
as he looked at the man.</p>
<p>And when he looked closer, the sensation grew even stronger.</p>
<p>“You really are a human? That is a good name, I suppose.” Evil
Eye mumbled something to himself beneath his breath. Han Sen heard
what he said, but he wasn’t quite sure what he meant by that.</p>
<p>Evil Eye wasn’t planning on explaining it, either. He looked
back at Han Sen, smiled, and said, “Your Dollar is pretty funny.
Would you mind if I had a look at it?”</p>
<p>“As you wish.” Han Sen lifted his right hand and put two of his
fingers together. Then, he flicked in the direction of Evil
Eye.</p>
<p>A coin appeared, and it teleported towards Evil Eye with the
speed of lightning.</p>
<p>Evil Eye made no effort to dodge the incoming coin or knock it
away with a godlight. Instead, he caught the incoming coin with the
palm of his right hand.</p>
<p>Pat!</p>
<p>The coin stuck to Evil Eye’s hand. His body began to sink, his
feet lowering into the sand a little.</p>
<p>“What a powerful Dollar! It not only has the ability to suppress
a foe, but it can seal. This could very well become a deified class
geno art. I cannot believe a geno art like this has been around,
unknown to me over the centuries of my existence.” Evil Eye brought
his hand closer to get a better look at the coin. He looked
genuinely interested in the item.</p>
<p>Evil Eye knew that Dollar’s suppression and sealing powers were
strong, as did everyone else. But he had to let the coin land on
him so that he could research it properly.</p>
<p>If anyone else had done something like this, they would have
seemed incredibly reckless. But to the people watching the bout, it
seemed the most natural thing in the world for Evil Eye to do.</p>
<p>“What a weird geno art. It is heavy… It forbids air… It
suppresses… and some weird power…” Evil Eye mumbled to himself.
Then he placed another of his fingers on the coin. He tightened his
grip, and the coin was crushed within his fist.</p>
<p>The viewers looked on in shock. The Dollar that was believed to
be indestructible, that had suppressed and defeated Dragon Eight,
had been shattered by Evil Eye. It appeared not to work on him at
all.</p>
<p>“Evil Eye really is untouchable! Dollar doesn’t even work on
him.”</p>
<p>This really is too frightening to watch. He has lived for so
long, too; this man is a god!”</p>
<p>“Dollar is useless, after all? With that out of the way, it
appears to me that Dollar has lost all chance of winning this
fight.”</p>
<p>“It looks like there is nothing more to see. That strongest
skill known as Dollar was broken by Evil Eye’s hands. How can
anyone expect this supposed fight to continue?”</p>
<p>“Evil Eye really is too scary.”</p>
<p>Amidst everyone’s shock at Evil Eye’s lackadaisical breaking of
the coin, Evil Eye suddenly moved. He did not move to attack Han
Sen, though. He threw the pieces of the coin into the air and made
them hover before him.</p>
<p>Evil Eye then wiggled his fingers. The pieces were covered in a
purple light, then they began to break down into smaller and
smaller chunks.</p>
<p>Bathed in the glow of that purple light, the coin was ground
into gold dust. The gold motes floated in front of Evil Eye.</p>
<p>“Your Dollar is not perfect… I was one of the Dragon, at one
point, and in my time with them, I was able to learn their Dragon
Seal. I was one of the Empty, as well. With them, I learned Vacuum.
And at another place in time, I belonged to the Destroyed. It was
with them that I learned how to perform Taboo. That’s not
forgetting my time as a Buddha…” Evil Eye appeared to be talking to
himself, as he moved his fingers. The gold dust gathered around
those fingers, though, recomposing the original shape.</p>
<p>A new coin had been created, but this one was slightly different
from the one Han Sen had produced. In addition to the coin and the
number count, there were purple engravings on it. They were
reminiscent of flowers.</p>
<p>Evil Eye held up that new coin he had produced. It was like a
work of art. He smiled at it.</p>
<p>“Dollar? What do you think of this, eh?” Evil Eye said, right
before flicking his finger. He propelled the modified coin straight
towards Han Sen with the speed of a laser beam.</p>
<p>All the audience was in shock. To dismantle an enemy’s geno art
and then go on to modify it in the middle of a fight was something
only a god could do. There was, of course, the possibility that
Evil Eye wasn’t even treating this fight as actual combat. He might
have just been curious about Dollar.</p>
<p>“Sick! A guy like Evil Eye should be forbidden from even joining
the Geno Being Scroll. Other races can’t do anything remotely
comparable to this!”</p>
<p>“How could something like this even happen? There should be
rules, and this should be against them.”</p>
<p>“Fuck! Before Evil Eye, no geno art can remain shrouded in
secrecy. That guy has been reborn as so many races over the years,
so there’s no telling just how many geno arts he has actually
learned.”</p>
<p>“He is a god.”</p>
<p>While everyone was reeling from the shock of this, Han Sen
reacted much like Evil Eye had. He made no move to block or deflect
the coin. All he did was use his right hand to grab it.</p>
<p>Boom!</p>
<p>When Han Sen grabbed the coin, the sand in a radius of
one-kilometer shook. That area sank half a meter.</p>
<p>Evil Eye smiled at Han Sen. “This may very well be your Dollar,
but you shouldn’t think about grabbing it so merrily. It’s mine
now.”</p>
<p>“Dollar is too emotional. He shouldn’t have tried to take it
back.”</p>
<p>“Oh, no! Dollar is being suppressed by Dollar! Does all the
excitement we anticipated come to an end here?”</p>
<p>“It looks like the suppression power of Dollar has been
amplified to a sickening level, after Evil Eye’s
modifications.”</p>
<p>“It is way too strong. There is no hope of victory against
that!”</p>
<p>Everyone was in shock. Even Sky Path Garden’s leader looked
bitter, and he said, “We cannot see anything like this! Guys like
Evil Eye shouldn’t ever be seen in a Marquise battleground.”</p>
<p>Evil Eye continued smiling at Han Sen. The expression had grown
a little rigid, but he kept it in place. Evil Eye wasn’t the only
one who was surprised, though. The audience watched as Dollar used
his other hand to crush the coin that had been manufactured,
modified, and fired by Evil Eye.</p>
<p>“Interesting modification, but it is too stiff to combine the
powers you proposed. While it may indeed look stronger, it lacks
the meaning and feel of the original,” Han Sen said coolly, while
he squeezed the coin.</p>
<p>“Oh, so you don’t think it is any good? Then show me how I can
avoid making it stiff.” Evil Eye’s eyebrow was raised.</p>
<p>Han Sen didn’t respond, though. He threw his coin into the air
while everyone was watching, and then he moved his finger to imbue
it with a golden light.</p>
