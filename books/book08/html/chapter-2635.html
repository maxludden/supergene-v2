<p>“You don’t want to offend people, so you want me to do it for
you? You are quite smart,” Sky Palace Leader said to Han Sen with a
smile.</p>
<p>Han Sen hadn’t explained his true purpose, but Sky Palace Leader
immediately recognized what he was doing.</p>
<p>“Sky Palace Leader is so smart. I want to do everything I can
for Sky Palace, but sadly, my body is unable to keep up. I cannot
bless a student every day.” Han Sen feigned complete sincerity. He
looked as if he wanted nothing more than to serve Sky Palace
Leader.</p>
<p>“Fine. I’ll be the bad guy, but in return, you will have to do
something for me,” Sky Palace Leader said to Han Sen with a
smile.</p>
<p>“Old Fox,” Han Sen muttered to himself. He had expected that if
he agreed to give out blessings, he would receive something
valuable in return. But it now looked as if he wouldn’t earn
anything extra, and he would have to do an additional task on the
leader’s behalf.</p>
<p>“You can ask me to do anything, Sky Palace Leader. Even if it
means I will end up destroyed and dead, I will do my best in such a
task. I would never ask for anything in return.” Han Sen lowered
his head and bowed.</p>
<p>“Is that so? You really won’t try to take advantage of the
situation?” If Han Sen hadn’t said the last few words, Sky Palace
Leader would have probably believed him. However, it was obvious
from what Han Sen said that he had been looking for some
goodies.</p>
<p>“If you are willing to do this, I will deal with all the people
who come to seek your blessing. You can decide when you want to
bless them, or if you want to at all. But if you can do this well,
I will still reward you,” Sky Palace Leader said dispassionately.
“What is it that you want me to do?” Han Sen had started to grow
worried as Sky Palace Leader spoke.</p>
<p>If Sky Palace Leader was establishing terms like this, whatever
task he wanted to give Han Sen had to be complicated.</p>
<p>“Go to the Very High,” Sky Palace Leader said simply.</p>
<p>“Why?” Han Sen was shocked. He looked at Sky Palace Leader with
confusion. He remembered Sky Palace Leader saying that he didn’t
want Han Sen to go to the Very High.</p>
<p>Sky Palace Leader smiled and said, “We need a spy amongst them.
I think you are up to the task, too.”</p>
<p>Han Sen almost thought his ears were broken. Going to the Very
High as a spy? Han Sen couldn’t think of anything that posed a
greater risk.</p>
<p>The Very High could see into a person’s mind. If he was
attempting to steal their secrets, it would only take them a split
second to discover that. Espionage among the Very High would be
suicide.</p>
<p>If anyone other than Sky Palace Leader had suggested this, Han
Sen would have assumed that they were simply an idiot. The idea
seemed like either pure stupidity or an elaborate way of getting
himself killed.</p>
<p>Sky Palace Leader knew what Han Sen was thinking, and so he
said, “Don’t worry. If I let you go, I have a way to safeguard your
mind that will keep them from peering into it. You are no good to
me dead.”</p>
<p>“But why would you even want me to go and spy on the Very High?”
Han Sen asked carefully.</p>
<p>If he was even going to consider doing this, he had to know
more. He needed the details because going to the Very High for
ulterior motives was a very dangerous game to play.</p>
<p>“It is very important to me. I need you to find someone within
the Very High. If you hear news of this person, you need to relay
it back to me. You don’t have to do anything more dangerous than
that,” Sky Palace Leader said.</p>
<p>“I’m not very good at looking for people, and I’m not very
skilled at socializing. I’m afraid I might fail your task.” Han Sen
didn’t want to go, so this was his way of rejecting the offer.</p>
<p>Sky Palace Leader looked at Han Sen and coldly said, “When you
finished this mission, I planned to give you the Constellation Sea
for you and your family. It looks like you aren’t interested,
though. So, never mind. It is fine.”</p>
<p>“Leader, the Constellation Sea you reference: is it the
xenogeneic space outside the Shining Star System?” Han Sen’s eyes
opened wide as he asked Sky Palace Leader.</p>
<p>The Constellation Sea was a xenogeneic space that had been
discovered some time ago. It was in a part of the universe that
belonged to Sky Palace. It was practically in Sky Palace’s
backyard, so the only way to enter it was through Sky Palace.</p>
<p>The Constellation Sea was connected to the Shining Star System
and an underdeveloped, barren system. It was a very unique place,
and it showed great promise if anyone ever developed it. Plus, the
Constellation Sea was very rich in resources and raw materials.
Many elders within Sky Palace wished to take control of the
Constellation Sea, and they had begun to fight over it. But because
the fights had grown too violent, Sky Palace Leader decided to seal
up the Constellation Sea and not give it to anyone.</p>
<p>Now, Sky Palace Leader said he was going to open up the
Constellation Sea exclusively for Han Sen. He could build a family
there. He wouldn’t just be permitted to use it; the leader was
going to let Han Sen govern the Constellation Sea. It would become
Han Sen’s territory. If he wanted to, it might even be possible to
build a human empire there. Other factions wouldn’t be able to
meddle or interfere in Han Sen’s affairs.</p>
<p>Unless Han Sen opened the Constellation Sea’s borders to travel,
no one would be able to wander in. Plus, the Constellation Sea
still had Sky Palace as a shield. It wouldn’t end up besieged
unless the whole of Sky Palace fell first.</p>
<p>“Good memory. It is the Constellation Sea near the Shining Star
System, yes,” Sky Palace Leader answered.Han Sen’s eyes narrowed in
thought. Sky Palace Leader was offering him a ludicrously valuable
reward. But that suggested the task wouldn’t be simple. Simply
relaying information wouldn’t be hard, and if Han Sen could truly
be taught to protect his mind, the danger level didn’t warrant such
a reward. Why would Sky Palace Leader be willing to give him
something so precious for fulfilling a task that was so easy?</p>
<p>“May I ask what kind of person you are looking for?” Han Sen
asked with hesitation. The Constellation Sea was a good place. He
wanted it, but he wouldn’t be able to enjoy owning it if he died at
the hands of the Very High.</p>
<p>“I’m looking for a Very High woman. I don’t know her name, and
I’m afraid her appearance might have changed from what I remember,”
Sky Palace Leader said thoughtfully.</p>
<p>“No name? No appearance? How am I supposed to find someone like
that?” Han Sen was shocked to hear that.</p>
<p>“Don’t worry. There is a way to find her. Otherwise, why would I
ask you to look for her?” Sky Palace Leader paused. Then, he said
seriously, “There is a birthmark on her chest that looks like a red
heart. You will be able to see it. It is very obvious.”</p>
<p>“Her chest has a birthmark that resembles a red heart? That is
quite obvious, you would think… Wait… Chest…” Han Sen glanced down
at his own chest. He looked strange as he asked Sky Palace Leader,
“You say you are looking for a Very High woman?” “Yes,” Sky Palace
Leader said with a nod of his head.</p>
<p>“Do you think I’ll have the chance to check out the chests of
various women for that birthmark?” Han Sen felt that Sky Palace
Leader might be tricking him. If he went to the Very High just to
check out their women, it would be a f*cking deathwish.</p>
<p>“If it was an easy task, why would I give you the Constellation
Sea?” Sky Palace Leader looked at Han Sen and said, “You don’t even
have to look at them yourself, anyway. You can just ask around.
Exquisite is a woman, for instance. She is more likely to have seen
it. And if you can get her to tell you, then you will have no
trouble. Come back in four years, and you can take your family to
the Constellation Sea. I will give you all the support you can ask
for. I will give you people, if you want. Do you want a boat? I can
give you a boat. You won’t have to pay taxes for three hundred
years, either.”</p>
