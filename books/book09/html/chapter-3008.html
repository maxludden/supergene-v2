<p>“Why are you here?” Han Sen and the white-clothed lady both
spoke at almost the same time.</p>
<p>The lady in front of him was the Dragon Lady Chef. She had left
Space Garden to practice. She had yet to return. Han Sen wondered
where she had gotten to. He certainly did not expect to run into
her there.</p>
<p>“I don’t know. I was on a xenogeneic island hunting xenogeneics
and met a weird guy. He said I could be his inheritor, and he
brought me here.” Dragon Lady paused and went on to say, “He often
brings me rare xenogeneic ingredients I can cook with. This place
is not all that bad, so I have not been in a hurry to</p>
<p>“Those two xenogeneics keep referring to a certain lady. Might
that be you?” Han Sen’s eyes opened wide as he looked at Dragon
Lady. He appeared to be surprised.</p>
<p>The Ancient Gods were always mysterious, and that was especially
true of Ancient God King. If that Dragon Lady could inherit Ancient
God King’s stuff, perhaps she would be able to become very powerful
in the universe and no one would dare provoke her.</p>
<p>“What lady? Are you insulting me?” Dragon Lady frowned.</p>
<p>“Not that kind of lady…” Han Sen wanted to explain, but he
suddenly heard a booming sound. The one-eyed xenogeneic and the
eight-armed black bear xenogeneic came rushing in.</p>
<p>“Kid, where are you going to run? Get ready to die!” the
eight-armed black bear weirdly shouted. Eight of his pores were
shining. They created eight little suns that were lobbed at Han
Sen.</p>
<p>“Big dumb bear, what are you doing?” Dragon Lady shouted at the
eight-armed black bear.</p>
<p>The eight-armed black bear heard Dragon Lady’s voice. It made
his entire body shake. He made his little suns even smaller. He
wished to say something, but the one-eyed xenogeneic spoke first.
“My Lady, this kid stole the ancient spirit seed. We are going to
take it back. You should avoid this situation and allow me to
reclaim the ancient spirit seed. We can talk all about this
later.”</p>
<p>After that, the one-eyed xenogeneic and eight-armed black bear
wanted to resume the attack on Han Sen. “How many times must I tell
you guys to not call me lady?” Dragon Lady coldly shouted. “Plus,
who is allowing you to capture people in my place? Furthermore, he
is a friend of mind. If you guys touch one finger of his, I will
turn you guys into barbecued pork.” “He is… Little Master’s… Is he
your friend?” The one-eyed xenogeneic and the eight-armed black
bear were in shock.</p>
<p>“Get out of here before I cook you,” Dragon Lady coldly said.
“We can’t do that,” the eight-armed black bear angrily said. “He
still has the ancient spirit seed. If we don’t take it back, the
master will scold us.”</p>
<p>The one-eyed xenogeneic quickly pulled the eight-armed black
bear back, smiled, and said, “You should rest, Little Master. We
will leave now.”</p>
<p>After that, the one-eyed xenogeneic pulled the eight-armed black
bear away.</p>
<p>The eight-armed black bear looked unsatisfied as it asked, “What
are you pulling me away for? If we do not bring back the ancient
spirit seed, and Master is angry, we are going to be done for.”</p>
<p>“You don’t know anything,” the one-eyed xenogeneic said. “The
geno holy fluid is for the Master giving it to the lady. If the
lady’s commands were disobeyed, the Master would be even angrier.
Then, our situation will be made even worse. If the lady has
already told us what to do, then this incident is out of our hands.
We should just go and tell Master.” It hastened its departure.</p>
<p>In the garden, Dragon Lady checked Han Sen out and said, “That
weird man poured blue blood all over you. Your body seems a little
different.”</p>
<p>“Did you see it too? Yes, I am a little different.” Han Sen had
a wry smile.</p>
<p>“Your muscles appear leaner,” Dragon Lady said while looking at
Han Sen. “The fat ratio has been lowered. Meat like this is not
suitable for cooking. You would do fine as a meatball.”</p>
<p>Han Sen’s forehead developed a cold sweat. “Don’t look at me
like I am food.”</p>
<p>After pausing, Han Sen looked at the Dragon Lady and said, “It
looks like you improved fast. You look like you have improved a
lot.”</p>
<p>“As I said, that weird guy gave me a lot of high-class
xenogeneic ingredients, so I have a lot of high-class genes,”
Dragon Lady replied. “I am butterfly class now. He says he is going
to get me a geno holy fluid. He said that if I drink it, I can
become a true god.”</p>
<p>“So, the Empty Dragon King in the wok has been cooked for you.”
Han Sen sounded jealous. “What Empty Dragon King?” Dragon Lady
sounded surprised.</p>
<p>Han Sen explained the whole thing. Dragon Lady sounded a bit
angry. “How could they do this? They really shouldn’t have. Such a
cute little baby… How could they dare to cook it?”</p>
<p>Han Sen nodded. The ancient spirit seed on his arm nodded
too.</p>
<p>Dragon Lady said with seriousness. “Right, for such a superior
ingredient, how could it be cooked so randomly? They should have
let me cook it instead.”</p>
<p>The foreheads of Han Sen and the ancient spirit seed on his arm
developed some black lines, especially the ancient spirit seed. It
looked scared and tried hiding in Han Sen’s arms.</p>
<p>Han Sen pointed at the ancient spirit seed and said, “Cough,
cough. By the way, Dragon Lady, if there are not many effects and
there is a replacement, can we not kill it for my sake?”.</p>
<p>The thing really did look like a human baby. Han Sen did not
want to see it become food.</p>
<p>“I am fine with that,” Dragon Lady said while opening her arms.
“I just do not know if he will agree.”</p>
<p>plight.” A voice echoed across the giant, underground garden. A
God Spirit-looking character broke space and entered the
garden.</p>
<p>Han Sen felt a chill. He looked at the God Spirit-like person.
In the shiny light, he saw a male body. Because of the rainbow
light, he could not see exactly what he looked like.</p>
<p>“My name is Han Sen. Are you Ancient God King?” Although Han Sen
did not feel the power of his opponent, with that atmosphere, he
knew he should have been something big.</p>
<p>Ancient God King coldly asked, “Are you Dragon Lady’s friend?
Call me Ancient Origin God.”</p>
<p>“You said you can let him live,” Han San quickly asked. “Is that
true?”</p>
<p>“Of course, I can let him go, but without it, Empty Dragon King
cannot be cooked in a short period of time. It will delay the time
needed to create the geno holy fluid. Unless…” Ancient Origin God
did not keep talking. He</p>
<p>“You can just tell me directly.” Han Sen knew there was
something else.</p>
<p>“Unless you can find a replacement. From what I have seen, you
are not bad.” Ancient Origin God looked at Han Sen as he spoke.</p>
<p>When he said that, Han Sen’s expression changed. He felt sorry
for the ancient spirit seed but not enough to trade his life for
it. He would not die for it.</p>
<p>Dragon Lady stopped before Han Sen. She looked at Ancient Origin
God as she said, “He is my friend. You cannot lay a finger on
him.”</p>
