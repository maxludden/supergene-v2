	<p>Bald Guy’s neck black was becoming redder and redder. It was like there was blood soaking through it. It was a
		very bloody and scary sight. It looked as if it was tightening and going to crack his neck. Although Bald Guy
		had combined with the repel evil rhino, it did not seem to work. It could not stop the blood coming through.</p>

	<p>“Is that really a God Spirit power?” Han Sen asked with a frown.</p>

	<p>The repel evil rhino was able to repel evil. It could reduce the effectiveness of evil. Ordinary gene races could
		not accomplish something like this. If it was a God Spirit power, it might work.</p>

	<p>The repel evil rhino only repelled evil. It could not repel gods. During their entire journey, they had dug up
		many land pulses and not seen a single God Spirit. They hadn’t discovered a god temple either.</p>

	<p>The skin on Bald Guy’s neck was becoming tighter. It would not last long. In the next second, it looked as if his
		head was going to be severed. The blood dyed his neck and his hands red. It looked like he was in pain.</p>

	<p>Li Bing Yu used a few gene combination skills, but nothing seemed to work on the break head wire.</p>

	<p>Han Sen frowned. He summoned the blood ghost spirit and combined with it. He placed his hand on Bald Guy’s neck
		and let the ghost blood spirit power go into break head wire to try to stop its power from working. It was a
		futile effort. The power of the blood ghost spirit was unable to prevent the break head wire from digging into
		Bald Guy’s throat. At the same time, Li Bing Yu’s break head wire started to bleed. Li Bing Yu’s face looked
		green. She immediately summoned a few gene races to suppress the scary power that sought to decapitate her, but
		nothing she tried worked.</p>

	<p>“Old Han, I am not going to make it! If you don’t die, go to Bamboo City and tell my father I will be his son in
		the next life too. Tell him to find a woman and make another baby so I can be reborn with him again.” Bald Guy
		clutched his neck. He was in great pain as he cried that out. He sounded as if someone was squeezing his neck
		and could not breathe.</p>

	<p>“With me here, nothing is going to take your life.” Han Sen’s eyes flashed with a godly light. He cast the power
		of the Xuan Yellow Sutra onto Bald Guy’s neck. It was strange. The Xuan Yellow Sutra’s power touched Bald Guy’s
		neck and worked like an eraser. It erased some of the black lines on Bald Guy’s neck.</p>

	<p>Han Sen saw it worked, so he went around the entire length of the black line until the break head wire on Bald
		Guy’s neck was wholly erased. Eventually, no trace of it remained.</p>

	<p>Han Sen thought that if the Xuan Yellow Sutra did not work, he would break the rules of the world and see who was
		doing this to them.</p>

	<p>If the Xuan Yellow Sutra worked, there was no need for him to go through such trouble.</p>

	<p>The black line around Bald Guy’s neck was gone. He felt immeasurable relief. He was like someone who had just
		been spared a hanging. He sat on the ground and gasped.</p>

	<p>The break head wire around Li Bing Yu’s neck bled. She revealed her identity by making use of a few of the Wu Wei
		Dao Palace’s secret skills. None of those worked either. The break head wire was like a seamless blade. It
		tightened around her neck. The blood on her snow-white neck was getting thicker. It made her feel depressed.</p>

	<p>Han Sen ran in front of her and placed his hands on her neck. Li Bing Yu immediately felt much better.</p>

	<p>Han Sen glided his hands around her neck until Li Bing Yu was completely freed. She did not suffer as much as
		Bald Guy had, but she still felt as if she had escaped death. She looked at Han Sen.</p>

	<p>A power that the Wu Wei Dao Palace’s skills could not erase was easily brushed away by Han Sen. The power he had
		unnerved her.</p>

	<p>Li Bing Yu and Han Sen had been together for a long time. She thought this person was very mysterious. She could
		never treat or think about him as an ordinary person.</p>

	<p>The black line around Bao’er’s neck didn’t do anything, but Han Sen still wiped it away. He only let his neck
		keep the black line around it.</p>

	<p>He knew the break head wire was a mark or a marking. The break head wire itself did not have a powerful power,
		but the frightening power that decapitated came from elsewhere used the black line like a conduit.</p>

	<p>He left the break head wire on him to see if it was possible to trace where the severing power came from.</p>

	<p>After a while, Han Sen felt as if his neck was getting tighter. It felt as if there was a very strong, thin wire
		being used to strangle him. It got tighter until it eventually felt like it was going to break his neck.</p>

	<p>Han Sen touched his neck, but he could not feel any wire. He could only feel his skin tightened where the break
		head wire was.</p>

	<p>“Old Han, what are you doing? Why don’t you erase the break head wire around your neck?” Bald Guy asked.</p>

	<p>“No matter who it is, if he tries to harm me, I will make him pay,” Han Sen coldly said. He did not want to erase
		the break head wire.</p>

	<p>The break head wire released a scary power. With Han Sen’s fitness level, the power was unable to do anything to
		harm him.</p>

	<p>Even though the scary power kept increasing, it never reached the point of drawing blood from Han Sen’s neck. The
		black line just tightened his neck a bit. It was like an invisible wire being used to strangle him.</p>

	<p>Time passed. Han Sen continued to fight the break head wire. Bald Guy was nervous watching him, but Han Sen’s
		neck had yet to bleed. The water in the river was starting to show signs of unrest. It was moving a lot more.
	</p>

	<p>In the end, a giant wave formed in the wide river. The wave was crazier than the waves at the sea.</p>

	<p>Li Bing Yu and Bald Guy glumly looked at the river. They sensed a scary presence spread across the river. It
		appeared to them as if something was getting ready to emerge.</p>

	<p>Voila!</p>

	<p>A green, stone tile came out of the water. It revealed its back. It was a roof composed of green tiles. A broken
		temple appeared in the river.</p>

	<p>Bald Guy looked at the old temple’s door frame. He saw a plaque and screamed, “Break Head God Temple… It really
		is Break Head God Temple… It’s the Break Head God Temple that killed Mister Tian and all his students back in
		the day! It is here!”</p>

	<p>The god temple was very old and broken. If ordinary people saw it, they would have thought it was a broken
		temple. With Han Sen’s peacock king eyes, he knew the god temple had purple-black flames rising. It was like it
		was covered in demonic power.</p>

	<p>Han Sen clearly felt that a scary creature was inside the god temple looking at him, but the creature’s presence
		was strange. Han Sen could not determine if it was a God Spirit or a gene race. After the god temple completely
		emerged from the water, Han Sen and the others were able to see what was inside it.</p>

	<p>Half of the old temple’s door was closed, and half of it was open. Han Seen peered inside the god temple and saw
		a god altar.</p>

	<p>The god temple did not have a god statue. Instead, there was a very bloody guillotine.</p>
