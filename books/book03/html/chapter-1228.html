<p>After learning Han Sen had recovered, people knew it was only a matter of time before he got to doing something big. This was beyond their wildest dreams, though, and no expected Han Sen to be capable of achieving such a feat.</p>

<p>He had brought down an emperor-class shelter in the Third God’s Sanctuary. Even in the super gene era, no one had believed it to be a remotely possible endeavor.</p>

<p>It was an emperor’s shelter, and each and every person knew how difficult conquering one could be. News spread fast, and even those who were previously unlearned about the Third God’s Sanctuary were informed of how powerful they were.</p>

<p>Many people thought the tales were preposterous, at first. But Thunder Hell Emperor was infamous and widely renowned, so the news of his vanquishing was not something that could have been faked.</p>

<p>There were thirty people who had been rescued by Han Sen’s heroic deed. The oldest of them was a fellow who was two hundred years old. The youngest had only been at the shelter for a year.</p>

<p>They were each able to prove that Han Sen had done what was being told, and they each spoke in great admiration as they retold what they had witnessed. Han Sen had indeed taken down Thunder Hell Shelter, and he had killed all the super creatures and king spirits that previously existed there with his posse.</p>

<p>Huang Tianze used to hold a title, and he was oft referred to as the Father of Warframes. He had been missing for sixty years. Han Sen had rescued him.</p>

<p>The Alliance went crazy as the stories of Han Sen’s effortless victory over an emperor shelter began to circulate.</p>

<p>The Alliance usually forbade the spreading of news regarding the Third God’s Sanctuary due to how horrible the place was. Most humans had to endure great suffering when they entered the Third God’s Sanctuary, and if this became widely known, many humans would be afraid of going. No progress would ever be made.</p>

<p>If that happened, humanity’s hopes and dreams of eventually conquering the Third God’s Sanctuary would be lost.</p>

<p>It might have been cruel to mislead people about the dire situation in the Third God’s Sanctuary, but it was a necessary evil. If humanity wanted to become greater, they had no choice but to go and brave the howling dark, even if that meant they would not return.</p>

<p>If humanity became too afraid of the cost of becoming greater, it would only be a matter of time before they were beaten and one day eliminated.</p>

<p>When the news was heard, the Alliance was taken by a Han Sen fever. Propaganda, spreading word of Han Sen’s deeds, was everywhere.</p>

<p>“An Emperor Shelter?! How did he do such a thing?” Old Qin was shocked, hearing the news for the first time.</p>

<p>Zhao Seven was sad, on the other hand. They had Angel Gene, but they had yet to take even a single king-class shelter.</p>

<p>“I’d like to be an adventuring partner of Han Sen, that is for sure!” Son of God, Liu Meng, heard the news and wanted nothing more than to group up with him. But thinking of his old man, he knew he couldn’t.</p>

<p>Tang Zhenliu said, “It has been quiet for so many years, hasn’t it? And now, the mad lad has gone and conquered an Emperor Shelter!”</p>

<p>“I am going to the Third God’s Sanctuary,” Yi Dongmu said, hearing the news. Then, he left.</p>

<p>Lin Feng, reading the news, immediately went back to practicing.</p>

<p>The whole Alliance was in fervent discussion about Han Sen and what he had accomplished for humankind, and news about the Third God’s Sanctuary was released to the masses.</p>

<p>Han Sen had become a hero, but he didn’t revel in the fanfare he was receiving. Currently, he was holding something far dearer to him, and his mouth drooled all the while.</p>

<p>“They are all mine.” Han Sen was holding a number of Life Geno Essences in his hand.</p>

<p>Bao’er looked at him in disdain, and she ran out, looking for Zero.</p>

<p>Han Sen was holding them all, kissing each of them in rapid succession.</p>

<p>Han Sen had killed six super creatures, yielding six Life Geno Essences. Two of them had left flesh behind, and another had provided him a super beast soul.</p>

<p>Still, none of the king spirits were willing to obey a new master. Three had been killed.</p>

<p>He was more than satisfied with what he had obtained from that daring conquest, though. And he was particularly happy with the beast soul he had managed to get.</p>

<div class="tables">
    <table class="beast">
        <tr>
            <th colspan="2">Beast Soul</th>
        </tr><tr>
            <td>Super Ancient Devil Soldier</td>
            <td>(Shapeshifting)</td>
        </tr>
    </table>
    <!--REPLACE-->

<p>It was a humanoid shapeshifting beast soul called Ancient Devil Soldier. It had armor and demon wings, which increased his power and speed. He could even fly with it. Furthermore, because it was humanoid, Han Sen was able to use the skills and hyper geno arts he had learned.</p>

<p>Han Sen did not absorb the Life Geno Essences yet, and he shared the merry time with Ji Yanran.</p>

<p>When Han Sen first went to the sanctuary, he wanted his family to improve and live a better life. Now, his goal was to simply become stronger. To learn the truths he also sought, Han Sen knew there were many areas he had to become even stronger in.</p>

<p>Ji Yanran told him, “Now I really want to go to the sanctuaries. I want to be there with you.”</p>

<p>“It’s too dangerous. And what’s more, I have no idea where you’d spawn. But don’t you worry, I will take down the whole of the Third God’s Sanctuary for you. Mom and Little Yan will also be able to go there without fear of unfair death and danger,” Han Sen said.</p>

<p>Han Sen knew full well how dangerous the sanctuary was. Merely going to the Third God’s Sanctuary was a risk, as spawning in the wrong shelter could leave you at the mercy of a spirit that didn’t even want you.</p>

<p>“Can you really take down the whole sanctuary?” Ji Yanran asked.</p>

<p>Han Sen placed her on his lap and slapped her bum.</p>

<p>“Why are you hitting me?” Ji Yanran blushed.</p>

<p>“You doubted my words, didn’t you?” Han Sen said, spanking her once more.</p>

<p>Suddenly, the slaps became soft. Han Sen’s hands turned to a gentle caress, like velvet. Then, they rode the heat of passion like a comet burning bright.</p>

<p>“I’ll take the Third God’s Sanctuary as a gift for you,” Han Sen said, at last.</p>

<hr />

<p>Han Sen was resting at home, after that. When Ji Yanran came back, she dropped many cards in front of him.</p>

<p>“What are these?” Han Sen asked.</p>

<p>“Receipts. Many people from different planets came to our shop to buy aircraft, all because they desire your signature,” Ji Yanran said.</p>

<p>“That many?! How many aircraft did you sell?” Han Sen was flabbergasted.</p>

<p>“Let’s just say we can live the rest of our lives merrily, all with the money I made today.” Ji Yanran paused to give a warm smile, then she said, “My Dad did tell you to prepare, though. The Alliance has created a new title called Super Aristocrat. You will be the first to receive it. And what’s more, my father will present you with medals in Levo Plaza.”</p>
