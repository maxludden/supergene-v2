<p>“What the f*ck is going on?” Bai Wan Jie was angry and
frustrated, but more than anything else, he was simply
confused.</p>
<p>Gold Armor General had been killed by Dollar and Dragon One. Why
would it have appeared here, all of a sudden? And on top of that,
it had taken the Sea Sky Eye’s core gene and the Sky God
Pillar.</p>
<p>It wasn’t uncommon for there to be multiple of the same type of
xenogeneic in the core area, but if there had been a second deified
Gold Armor General, someone would have noticed.</p>
<p>Bai Wan Jie could only think of one possibility. Although it was
hard to believe, he couldn’t think of any other reasonable
explanations for what had happened.</p>
<p>“Dollar? Where is Dollar?”</p>
<p>Li Keer’s mouth was hanging open, and she showed no signs of
remembering to close it.</p>
<p>She hadn’t been sure where Han Sen had gone when he sneaked away
from their chess match, but she had assumed he had headed toward
the battleground. Because of that, she had been keeping a careful
eye on the events of the battle. Seeing the gold general destroy
the Sea Sky Eye and steal the Sky God Pillar had been a shock for
her, too.</p>
<p>She knew that Gold Armor General had been killed by Dollar, so
seeing the Gold Armor General show up again had been unexpected, to
say the least.</p>
<p>But her shock was different from Bai Wan Jie’s. Li Keer kept
staring at the spot where the Gold Armor General had vanished. When
the Gold Armor General flew away from the battlefield, she had lost
her ability to sense it. She couldn’t feel any trace of its
presence.</p>
<p>“Was that Dollar?” Li Keer knew the Gold Armor General had to be
connected to Dollar in some capacity. There was more chance of that
than of it being under Bai Wan Jie’s control, at least. Li Keer was
certain it was Dollar because he was the only person she knew who
could evade being picked up by the Very High Sense. Aside from
Dollar, Li Keer was confident that no one in this system could
commit such an act and then escape her senses.</p>
<p>Not long after, Li Keer saw the Dollar sitting in front of her
become blurry for a moment. If she wasn’t right in front of Dollar,
she wouldn’t even have noticed when his real body returned from the
battlefield.</p>
<p>Li Keer looked at Han Sen and opened her mouth to say something,
but before she could speak, Bai Wan Jie rushed up and surrounded
them with a contingent of his royal knights. “Dollar, hand over the
Sea Sky Eye core gene and the Sky God Pillar,” Bai Wan Jie said
while looking at Han Sen.</p>
<p>“My Prince, you must be looking for the wrong person.” Han Sen
raised his head and coldly met the man’s stare.</p>
<p>“Give me the core gene and the Sky God Pillar. Then, we can
pretend nothing happened, and I will still owe you a favor,” Bai
Wan Jie said with a frown.</p>
<p>Han Sen opened his palms wide and said, “Crown prince, I would
certainly enjoy it if you owed me a favor, but I really don’t have
the core gene or the Sky God Pillar. I’ve never even seen the
things you are speaking about.”</p>
<p>Bai Wan Jie coldly looked at Han Sen. He could not be sure if
Gold Armor General was related to Dollar, but the Extreme King had
paid a lot for what they had just lost. They even wasted an Ancient
God Statue. He couldn’t just let it go and return to his people
with nothing</p>
<p>“In that case, you’ll need to come with us and explain the
situation to our people,” Bai Wan Jie said slowly, staring at Han
Sen.</p>
<p>“Do you Extreme Kings really enjoy throwing your weight around
that much? Just because you told us not to come close to the
battleground, I obliged, My Prince. When your people approached me,
I turned around and left as requested. Now, you haven’t even
thanked me. And what’s more, you’re trying to accuse me of stealing
your stuff. What kind of person do you think I am?” Han Sen’s voice
had grown chilly, and his face was darkening.</p>
<p>Bai Wan Jie had already spoken to the two half-deifieds he set
to guard Dollar, so he knew that Dollar was speaking the truth. But
Dollar was the one who had killed the Gold Armor General. And it
had appeared in the battleground and stolen the Sea Sky Eye core
gene and the Sky God Pillar. The entire situation was way too
coincidental, which was why Bai Wan Jie refused to believe there
was no connection between the thief and Dollar.</p>
<p>“You think too much. I’d just like you to help investigate this
crime. Please, do a favor for the Extreme King and come with us,”
Bai Wan Jie said, his voice becoming less accusatory. He was still
suspicious, though, and he wouldn’t let it go easily.</p>
<p>Plus, there was too much that he didn’t know about Dollar,
anyway. He was going to take the strange man back to the Extreme
King no matter what.</p>
<p>Li Keer knew it was her time to say something. Dollar was being
pushed to the edge, but all she had to do was reveal her true self.
If she did that, Bai Wan Jie would leave. Then, Dollar would be
impressed by who she was and owe her a favor. It was a two birds
with one stone opportunity.</p>
<p>Li Keer narrowed her eyes. She was going to say something, but
Han Sen laughed and said, “Bai Wan Jie, do you think that all other
races are merely slaves of the Extreme King? Do you think others
must do whatever you bid them to? You think far too highly of your
heritage.”</p>
<p>“The universe doesn’t belong to us, but you still have to come
with us today.” Bai Wan Jie stood as still as a statue, and he
continued to glare down on Han Sen.</p>
<p>Many of the Extreme King knights drew closer. They built a
formation to block all of Han Sen’s potential escape routes.
Whenever Bai Wan Jie gave the command, they would use their powers
against Dollar in tandem, the same way they had fought against the
Sea Sky Eye. Even if Dollar had the power to fight a deified elite,
their powers would allow them to stand up to him.</p>
<p>Han Sen was still sitting in front of the chessboard with a
chess piece in his hand. He paid little attention to the royal
knights, and his mind was clearly still focused on his next
move.</p>
<p>“It looks like I’m going to have to force you back,” Bai Wan Jie
growled.Before he could give the command, Nightmare Knight had
already activated his heart area. The King class knights unleashed
their powers in sequence, layering their areas over Han Sen and Li
Keer. The scary powers seemed demonic, and it suddenly felt like
some unimaginable apocalypse was bearing down upon them.</p>
<p>“This is good. I won’t save Dollar until the Extreme King has
pushed him to the brink. My last-minute rescue will be even more
staggering,” Li Keer smugly thought.</p>
<p>Those scary areas came down with enough power to destroy an
entire planet. And all the while, Han Sen continued to deliberate
his chess move without a care in the world.</p>
<p>Red, orange, yellow, green, chartreuse, blue, and purple areas
spread out around them. Wind, fire, thunder, and lightning; all
kinds of overwhelming powers roared. Knives, swords, spears, and
axes were breaking the sky as they came. Attacks were surging
toward Han Sen from all directions.</p>
<p>But Han Sen still sat where he was without moving. It was like
the enormous wave of lethal power didn’t even exist. Han Sen’s brow
was furrowed in thought, as if the chess game in front of him was
more important than anything</p>
<p>Li Keer frowned. When she saw that Han Sen was giving no
indication that he wanted to move, she hadn’t a clue about what he
was planning to do.</p>
<p>As that tsunami of power prepared to crash down across him, Han
Sen set his chess piece down on the chessboard. The chess piece
clicked, loud and clear, as it touched down on the chessboard.</p>
<p>That crunchy, striking sound was like a switch getting flicked.
The moment the chess piece came down, the roaring rain, wind,
thunder, sword lights, knife lights, and scary areas vanished. The
attacks became shadows, then faded entirely.</p>
