	<p>The skin was easy to heal, but bones and veins were not. Fortunately, the red Ganoderma was able to provide
		effective healing for all three.</p>

	<p>Han Sen stayed in the shell for four days, until he was fully healed. Without those red mushrooms, it would have
		taken at least ten times that long.</p>

	<p>“This is good. It’s a shame there was only seven and I’ve eaten one. That means there are only six left,” Han Sen
		thought, with a greedy desire.</p>

	<p>His body felt better, but that was all that had changed. The crocodile and the monsters outside were still there.
		He went out of the shell to take a look at things and used his Dongxuan Aura to scan the crowds. Much to his
		dismay, he was able to detect super creatures in their midst.</p>

	<p>“If not even super creatures dare come in here to eat the meat, how strong must the crocodile be?” Han Sen was
		shocked, to say the least.</p>

	<p>Luckily, the crocodile was still focused on the meat inside the shell. It had yet to pay any attention to Han Sen
		and Bao’er.</p>

	<p>Han Sen wouldn’t dare touch the crocodile, especially now that he had detected two super creatures down below.
		With all the sacred and mutant class creatures buffering the crowds, Han Sen thought it was too reckless for him
		to try to escape that way. As such, he decided to stay.</p>

	<p>“What do we do?” Han Sen did not want to stay, and he doubted that the crocodile would continue to ignore them
		after it had finished off the shell king’s meat. If the crocodile did show an interest in the two, things would
		turn sour.</p>

	<p>If he left now, he wouldn’t have to fight the spooky crocodile, but there was no guarantee he could escape the
		horde safely.</p>

	<p>Han Sen watched the creatures from inside the shell, hoping there’d be a shift or an opportunity that might score
		him a chance to escape. But more and more creatures were coming over time, and with every second that passed,
		the chances of leaving were got slimmer.</p>

	<p>Han Sen noticed a problem, then. For the first few days, the creatures did not dare get too close to the shell.
		But now their patience was growing thin, and they were inching their way closer.</p>

	<p>The creatures that were able to fly had been bold enough to circle the hole. When that occurred, the crocodile
		roared at them, which prompted them to disperse.</p>

	<p>“It looks like it’s only a matter of time before they decide to breach this place and enter. When that happens,
		the crocodile will have no choice but to fight them. Perhaps I can escape in the midst of all that chaos,” Han
		Sen thought to himself.</p>

	<p>If Han Sen wasn’t going anywhere right now, he could only spend his time practicing the Dongxuan Sutra and
		Jadeskin so he could regenerate the Bulwark Umbrella and the Crystal Core.</p>

	<p>Getting them back was easier than generating them the first time had been. All it took, more than anything, was
		time.</p>

	<p>Han Sen tried to absorb the two Life Geno Essences he had retrieved, but for some reason, he was unable to. Han
		Sen tried to simulate the creatures’ energy flows, but it was to no avail. He guessed he might have been too
		weak to do that, in his current form.</p>

	<p>Han Sen tried researching and experimenting for a while, but he was unable to pinpoint why he couldn’t absorb the
		Life Geno Essences. He did notice that the energy inside them was strange, and somewhat different than what he
		had seen before.</p>

	<p>It was like the two Life Geno Essences were not just power; there was a life inside.</p>

	<p>“The shell king and the red cricket are dead. How can their Life Geno Essences harbor a lifeforce? It’s almost as
		if these things are unborn eggs. Does this mean they can come back to life?” Han Sen thought, but he was unsure
		whether or not that was true.</p>

	<p>Two days later, the impatience of the creatures outside rose. Many of the flying creatures were spending time on
		top of the shell, while the ground ones were right against its bottom. They all looked hungry and greedy.</p>

	<p>None of them cared about the crocodile’s roaring anymore, so it had actually stopped trying to scare them off. As
		long as the creatures did not enter, the crocodile would ignore them.</p>

	<p>“It looks like they’re going to come in soon. I wonder what they are waiting for?” Han Sen thought.</p>

	<p>A few hours later, Han Sen heard a noise. The creatures had formed a path, and traversing that was a horned
		creature with a turtle-like body and a snake-like head. It climbed into the shell without any hesitation.</p>

	<p>When the snake-turtle came inside, so too did the rest of the creatures. Quickly, things got out of hand. Every
		creature was like a hungry wolf, desperately leaping at every morsel of flesh they could grab.</p>

	<p>“They must have been waiting for the snake-turtle. I guess now my time has come.” Han Sen was so happy. The
		messier the fray, the better it would be for him and his escape.</p>

	<p>All the creatures that came pouring in made the crocodile furious. It roared and summoned its geno core, which
		was like a giant pair of scissors. They were blue and the blades were cruelly serrated. They immediately swung
		open to cut a few of the creatures in half.</p>

	<p>The scissors flashed into the group of creatures, destroying everything that came into contact with them.</p>

	<p>The two creatures Han Sen believed to be super creatures avoided the scissors, not willing to fight the geno core
		face-to-face. They didn’t even summon geno cores of their own to make battle.</p>

	<p>“It is no wonder they were all afraid of coming. The crocodile’s geno core is too strong, and it cuts everything
		in half. It’s scarier than the Red Crystal Cricket’s ruby slicer.” Han Sen was in quite a shock. He looked at
		the snake-turtle. “The creatures all waited for the snake-turtle to come. It must have been in the belief it
		could effectively make battle with the crocodile.”</p>

	<p>Han Sen looked at the snake-turtle. It didn’t care about the other creatures. The snake’s upper-body merely
		grabbed a hunk of meat and began ravaging it down. It paid no attention to the nearby slaughter and the
		crocodile’s scissors.</p>

	<p>It didn’t see the scissors, but when it ate the meat, it incited the anger of the crocodile. The crocodile
		roared, and the scissors flew forward to cut the snake-turtle.</p>

	<p>The snake-turtle was not afraid, though. It continued munching on the meat, as its body began to flash. A copper
		bell appeared to shield its own body and prevent the scissors from reaching it.</p>

	<p>Dong!</p>

	<p>There was a metal noise. The scissors banged against the bell, unable to cut it in half. Under the protection of
		the copper bell, the snake-turtle could eat the meat unopposed. And while the crocodile’s attention had been
		drawn to the snake-turtle, the lesser creatures in the vicinity used that opportunity to chow down on the meat.
