<p>“D*mn you all!” Han Sen gritted his teeth.</p>

<p>Han Sen allowed the spirits to hear what Luo Lan said because he wished for them</p>

<p>all to understand why he was going to annihilate them. He wanted them to know that</p>

<p>what was coming was deserved.</p>

<p>Although Luo Lan had not yet been hurt, it didn’t take much intellect to envision what</p>

<p>might have happened to her if Han Sen hadn’t been able to come back.</p>

<p>Han Sen walked in front of No God Emperor, and as he did, everyone’s eyesight was</p>

<p>returned. But they could not move and they could not speak.</p>

<p>Han Sen coldly told the emperor, “No God, damn you. For your latest transgression</p>

<p>against humans, I’m going to kill you. Forever.”</p>

<p>No God Emperor was given the ability to speak, but he balked in Han Sen’s face by</p>

<p>saying, “So what if you kill me? I can respawn. I don’t think you can stay in the Third</p>

<p>God’s Sanctuary for long. One of these days, I’ll kill them all.”</p>

<p>No God Emperor rebuking Han Sen actually inspired the other spirits with more</p>

<p>courage. It was true that Han Sen could not keep returning on a whim, and dead</p>

<p>spirits didn’t stay dead as long as their spirit stones were fine. They had more</p>

<p>chances in the future, that was for sure.</p>

<p>“You’re telling me you’ll try this again? Is that right?” Han Sen coldly said. “Zero; do</p>

<p>your thing.”</p>

<p>Zero swung her Bone Dagger without being inhibited. She was targeting No God</p>

<p>Emperor, whose movement had been restricted.</p>

<p>The dagger punched neatly into the temple of his forehead, and after that occurred,</p>

<p>No God Emperor’s face looked distraught.</p>

<p>Pang!</p>

<p>No God Emperor’s body shattered like glass, and so did his spirit stone, wherever it</p>

<p>was.</p>

<p>That newfound courage in the spirits dissipated, after that. They knew what had</p>

<p>happened to No God Emperor, and they feared the same happening to them. They</p>

<p>tried to suicide in an attempt to escape, but Han Sen had stolen their ability to do so.</p>

<p>Han Sen walked before Ruin Emperor next, and then, he gestured for Zero to cut his</p>

<p>entire head off. He wasn’t even given the opportunity to speak.</p>

<p>One by one, Han Sen and Zero walked to each emperor spirit and had each of them</p>

<p>beheaded. The terror of those in-line was tangible.</p>

<p>Han Sen was planning to see to it that each spirit was killed, but the army was large,</p>

<p>and he had little time left there. He could feel the tug of the portal beckoning his</p>

<p>return to the Fourth God’s Sanctuary.</p>

<p>Demi-Gods were not supposed to reside in the Third God’s Sanctuary, and it was</p>

<p>actually dangerous for them to stay there long. He would have to take his leave very</p>

<p>soon.</p>

<p>And he now understood why Night Empress had to leave so swiftly. The pressure of</p>

<p>keeping his stay in the Third God’s Sanctuary was slowly becoming unbearable, and</p>

<p>it was highly likely that his body could be ruined by remaining there for long.</p>

<p>“I’ll give the rest of you one last chance to make this work. If I need to come knocking</p>

<p>again, I won’t be showing any mercy; and neither will there be any theatrics.” Han</p>

<p>Sen gestured with his hand and made all the spirits explode. Those he did this to</p>

<p>returned to their spirit stones to lick their wounds.</p>

<p>Han Sen did not kill any of the creatures there. His beef was with the spirits, more</p>

<p>than anything, and he knew the rest of his companions could deal with the creatures</p>

<p>just fine.</p>

<p>He let loose his grip on them, and as soon as they regained control of their limbs, the</p>

<p>creatures tried taking off. They scrambled as best they could to get away.</p>

<p>They were so frightened after what had happened. Creatures couldn’t respawn like</p>

<p>spirits could, after all. They sure wished they could run faster, though.</p>

<p>The only person Han Sen had left alive was Sky King. He was planning on</p>

<p>interrogating that sickly emperor, as there was much he wanted to learn before he</p>

<p>departed.</p>

<p>Qing Jun was his daughter, too; as much as Han Sen despised Sky King, he didn’t</p>

<p>think it was very nice to have her father brutally murdered in front of her, deserving or</p>

<p>no.</p>

<p>“Demigods are so strong! Whoa, it looks like I should strive for a promotion.” Xie</p>

<p>Qing King laughed.</p>

<p>“Haha! If you’re interested, I can take you back with me. But… not ascending through</p>

<p>the fires could inhibit you further down the line, and you may struggle. Becoming a</p>

<p>god will later become extremely difficult,” Han Sen said.</p>

<p>“Understood! From this point on, I will strive to become a demigod the proper way.</p>

<p>Where’s the fun in taking a shortcut,” Xie Qing King said.</p>

<p>Han Sen asked Dry Bone King and Water Fairy, “I have explained the situation, but if</p>

<p>you still want to come, you may. Does anyone want to become a demigod, any of</p>

<p>you can come with me?”</p>

<p>Han Sen expected some of them to return with him, but surprisingly, none chose to</p>

<p>come. They all looked at each other, and despite wanting to become demigods, they</p>

<p>all agreed that if they were to ascend, they should do it the proper way.</p>

<p>Even Snowball, who was a bona fide wimp, did not fancy cutting any corners.</p>

<p>Han Sen was an example to them all, too, he later realized. They had seen what Han</p>

<p>Sen was capable of, and they wanted to replicate his success and strength. They</p>

<p>wanted to follow in his footsteps and do things right.</p>

<p>Han Sen rubbed his nose and shook his head and said, “I understand.”</p>

<p>Luo Lan then walked up to Han Sen and provided him with a few items.</p>

<p>She gave him the Cruel Bottle, and even Meowth. He hadn’t taken them with him</p>

<p>when he ascended the Ten Steps of the Holy Door due to the added strain it would</p>

<p>have posed. He was afraid the fire would have incinerated them.</p>

<p>“Thank you. And now, Mom, I should go.” Han Sen’s body was having trouble</p>

<p>remaining in the Third God’s Sanctuary. He placed Sky King inside the Cruel Bottle</p>

<p>and began walking back.</p>

<p>Han Sen could at least chat with his mother back in the Alliance whenever he wished</p>

<p>to. There was no need to do it there.</p>

<p>Han Sen waved goodbye to everyone and then stepped back into the vortex-like</p>

<p>portal that would take him back to the Fourth God’s Sanctuary.</p>

<p>Inside the Cruel Bottle, Yaksha, Sky King, and even Meowth were all fine and safe</p>

<p>during their transport.</p>

<p>Han Sen was just going to treat Meowth like a pet, sort of like he always had. He</p>

<p>wasn’t bringing it through to do any fighting.</p>

<p>Many emperors had been slain in the Third God’s Sanctuary, and with the prospect</p>

<p>of Han Sen possibly returning, none dared to attack the humans again. They could</p>

<p>keep Sky Mountain.</p>

<p>Han Sen returned to the Alliance to be with Ji Yanran shortly after this escapade, as</p>

<p>her due date was incredibly soon. He was very excited to have a son.</p>

<p>There was nothing for him to do in the sanctuary right now, anyway. He could not</p>

<p>take on super creatures, so the best thing he could do was train and practice, which</p>

<p>he oftentimes did in the Alliance.</p>

<p>Ji Ruozhen and his wife had been taking good care of Ji Yanran during the time she</p>

<p>had been pregnant and Han Sen had been absent. And while Luo Lan was</p>

<p>overjoyed she’d soon have a grandson, Han Sen did not fully trust her with the ability</p>

<p>of raising a kid.</p>

<p>The next day, Ji Yanran was taken to the delivery room. Han Sen, Luo Lan, Ji</p>

<p>Ruozhen, and his wife were all waiting outside, eagerly awaiting news.</p>
