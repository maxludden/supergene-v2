Han Sen was holding the skull head. The eye sockets fired out two beams of green light. It was a shame that when they touched the Cold Light Charm's pink beams of light, the green light was destroyed. It was not on the same level of power.

Han Sen's face did not change. He expected that the Yin Head Ghost beast soul's power would be insufficient. Almost at the exact moment, the green light was destroyed, Han Sen activated his Sky Star Wolf glyph's power.

Seeing the pink beam of light, Han Sen took a deep breath and threw a punch toward it.

Pang!

The blue starlight and pink beam of light collided. The two powers exploded to become a red and blue firework in the air.

"How is that possible?" Everyone was shocked. They all looked at Han Sen with absolute shock. No one expected Han Sen, who did not seem as if he could fight, could wield a power that great and fight back against the Cold Light Charm.

Even Evil Lotus God looked at Han Sen with surprise. He really did not think Han Sen could explode with such a ferocious power.

"Second Uncle, you and I will fight that xenogeneic together. You use the time area to assist my power, and I will kill it." Han Sen noticed that with one hit, the four Sky Star Wolf combination was still weaker than the Cold Light Charm. The full power of his attacks could only tie with one of Cold Light Charm's beams of light.

"Good!" Second Uncle felt alive. Although he did not know why Han Sen had such power, it gave him a glimmer of hope to hang on to.

Second Uncle pushed his time area to the max, making all the time substance chains twist in the air. It made Cold Light Charm's movements a bit slower and Han Sen's speed faster.

It was actually not Han Sen's speed that was faster. When time went faster, it made it look like his speed was faster.

With one positive and one negative, Han Sen's speed was faster than Cold Light Charm. His body was shining with starlight. He was like a blue stream of stars shooting across the heavens. He soared through the pink beam of light Cold Light Charm fired and went straight for the beast itself.

"What is the point of being faster than Cold Light Charm? His power still cannot damage Cold Light Charm, and he will still die." Evil Lotus looked at him with disdain as he spoke.

He sensed that Han Sen's absolute showing of power was inferior to Cold Light Charm, and it was not as good as Second Uncle Bai Buyi. With his power being what it was, even if he touched Cold Light Charm, he could not damage Cold Light Charm.

Han Sen did not seem to understand that. He was still getting in close to Cold Light Charm. With Second Uncle's time area control, it made him easily be able to dodge the pink beam of light.

*Boom!*

The blue starlight suddenly opened up between Han Sen's fist and Cold Light Charm's tentacles. That starlight power did not break Cold Light Charm's cold semi-transparent metal body. It was shaken and shattered.

"It didn't work. It is still not enough." Second Uncle was a bit disappointed. Although he sort of expected that to happen, seeing it unfold the way he predicted was still a bit disappointing.

Bao Qin and the others had just managed to cling onto a thread of hope, but it was severed by that punch. Anyone could tell that Han Sen's power was weaker than Cold Light Charm by a lot.

But Han Sen did not give up. His body was like lightning. It surrounded Cold Light Charm and flashed fast. He kept on punching Cold Light Charm's body to make the blue starlight keep breaking.

"The difference between our powers cannot be replaced by how many times you punch. Even if you generate power like Under the Sky Knife, you cannot beat Cold Light Charm." Evil Lotus God coldly laughed as he spoke.

No matter what the others thought, Han Sen kept on punching Cold Light Charm non-stop. As he punched more and more, his punching power did indeed increase.

"A gathering power geno art that activates potential?" Evil Lotus God looked a bit like he had underestimated him. "Activating potential skills can increase one's battle power by a lot, but it needs potential to activate. For a larva class xenogeneic, no matter how much potential is activated, it still cannot reach butterfly at max power as Cold Light Charm can. Even if you squeeze out all the gene potential and use all your life power for a suicide attack, it still won't be enough to damage Cold Light Charm."

Second Uncle and the others knew that Han Sen was forcing the activation of his potential. As Evil Lotus had said, he needed enough potential first. Otherwise, even if he exploded his body, he would still not gather enough power to hurt Cold Light Charm.

It was like a one-liter bottle of gas. No matter how much you blew it up, you would not get the effect of a missile.

Han Sen did not care. He kept activating his body's potential.

Other people may not have known, but he did. His body was transmutation class, but he could not activate his body's power. To other people, this was activating his potential. To him, he was just trying to activate the ordinary power he had inside him.

While Han Sen was being suppressed, the power hidden inside him kept being activated. The starlight of his punch got stronger. It started with starlight. In the end, it looked like a blue sun after every punch.

Pang!

Cold Light Charm's body had been punched by Han Sen, but it did not shrug it off like it used to. The transparent, metal tentacles had a punch mark in them. The pink dust was everywhere. Cold Light Charm squealed in pain.

"Is he still activating potential? How much potential does he have? There's no way he can kill Cold Light Charm." Second Uncle kept controlling his time area. He saw Han Sen's starlight was bright like a sun and still expanding. He was as much shocked as he was delighted.

"Hmph. With this kind of potential power exploding, you are going to die from exhaustion. How long do you think you can last?" Evil Lotus God did not care for the spectacle. From what he saw, Han Sen was exploding his potential too much, which was as good as a death wish.

Pang! Pang!

Han Sen's small body, which looked like a god that was carrying starlight, needed the time area's control to evade the cold light beam attacks. Now, he did not need it.

Han Sen swung his fist for a punch. It was like the stars in the sky falling. It suppressed Cold Light Charm and broke Cold Light Charm's pink light beam. It was so powerful and hard to believe.

Bao Qin was crazily happy. He screamed, "He can continue to activate his potential! That potential is so scary! It is no wonder the king wanted to take him as a student! His potential is scary!"

"Hold on. You must hold on. If you can survive, after we go back to the Extreme King, even if I go bankrupt, I will use everything to heal your exhausted body." Meng Lie's palms were dripping with sweat. He was larva class and knew the body of someone in that class would take an insane amount of power to explode like that. After the fight, if Han Sen defeated the Cold Light Charm, his body would be destroyed.

If he suffered bad luck and was unable to defeat Cold Light Charm, Han Sen would be exhausted and end up dead.
