      Stay Up Late was just a soldier, not a high-ranking officer or important
      individual in the crystallizer civilization. He only knew the history of
      the crystallizers from what he learned in the history books.
    </p>
    <p>
      The history he knew about the crystallizers placed their origins in the
      sanctuaries.
    </p>
    <p>
      The crystallizers wished to avoid a war, and so they sought refuge in the
      sanctuaries. Heaven knew how long it took after that before their
      civilization developed into what it became.
    </p>
    <p>
      Many elites wished to leave the sanctuaries and return to the outside.
      They did succeed in doing this, but they were also destroyed. Something
      bad happened inside the sanctuaries that resulted in the destruction of
      their entire civilization. That was what became their recorded history.
    </p>
    <p>
      Stay Up Late didn’t exactly know what had happened, amidst the downfall
      and disaster. It affected him, anyway, and put him to sleep inside the
      geno fluid. He remained there in stasis until Han Sen woke him up.
    </p>
    <p>
      Stay Up Late only remembered the powers passing over him that made things
      feel as if the world was ending. He couldn’t resist it and passed out.
      Nowadays, all that remained of the crystallizers were fragments and
      remnants. Only ruins had been left behind, following what transpired.
    </p>
    <p>
      Stay Up Late said the crystallizers were far more advanced than humans, at
      their peak. They had evolved more than humans, as well. Even elites like
      him were just soldiers back then. He was in the Special Forces, but that
      still put him a long way from being the best of the best
    </p>
    <p>
      There were four crystallizer elites: the Northern King, Eastern King,
      Southern King, and Western King. Aside from Eastern King, the others
      wished to escape the sanctuaries. They wanted to leave and reclaim the
      lands they had lost.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the crystallizers had been gone from that world for too long, and they
      had no clue how scary it had become. Their developments made them too
      confident, and Han Sen knew the end.
    </p>
    <p>
      Humans were a tribe of crystallizers, or to put it in a slightly starker
      way, they were test tube results of beings that had been spliced with
      crystallizer genes.
    </p>
    <p>
      Many test subjects were regarded as the lowest of the low in the
      sanctuaries, so they were given the opportunity to grow. The crystallizers
      were hoping to produce a greater race that would one day help them reclaim
      the lands they had lost.
    </p>
    <p>
      There were many races based on the crystallizers. Some were immediately
      sent out of the sanctuaries, but none were able to survive longer than a
      month.
    </p>
    <p>
      Stay Up Late recalled there was a place they used as a graveyard, where
      they could also store their geno armors. But after the disaster, most of
      their civilization was destroyed, and the location of that place was
      unknown to him now.
    </p>
    <p>Han Sen could guess he was talking about the Hero Spirit Hall.</p>
    <p>“What humans died there? Amidst the fighting?” Han Sen asked.</p>
    <p>
      Stay Up Late went silent for a bit before responding. When he did, he
      said, “The creatures were given crystallizer genes, but the splicing also
      included the genes of other beings, too. As a result, they were different.
      To the best of my knowledge, the humans were incapable of reaching the
      Alliance before the disaster. Humans did eventually get there, but it was
      only after our downfall. Once there, you started to breed.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “But you only created one creature. How was it able to reproduce?” Han Sen
      asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      “So? Your race is called human, but you have other genes within you.
      Still, your body kept the same height as the crystallizers. The other
      genes may have come from more crystallizers belonging to a different
      tribe,” Stay Up Late said.
    </p>
    <p>
      Han Sen asked Stay Up Late a number of other questions. Han Sen was
      worried, as the last time the crystallizers opened the sanctuary, it
      remained open. If someone generated a geno armor, they’d be sent out of
      the sanctuary.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was impossible to close the sanctuaries now, and in regards to how that
      might be done, only the four kings had known.
    </p>
    <p>
      But even if Han Sen and Stay Up Late did know how to close the
      sanctuaries, they probably wouldn’t have been able to do it by themselves.
    </p>
    <p>
      “What is the outside world like?” Han Sen was curious to learn about this.
    </p>
    <p>
      Stay Up Late gave a wry smile and said, “I don’t know. Like I said, I was
      merely a soldier. Even the high-class crystallizers didn’t know much about
      the outside world, though. If they had, they wouldn’t have made the
      mistakes they did, which resulted in the near obliteration of our race.
      They hid in the sanctuaries for too long, not learning about the outside
      world.”
    </p>
    <p>
      Han Sen thought this might be the case. After they were done talking, he
      decided to go and see Han Yufei. He explained the situation to him and
      told him not to generate his self geno armor. Too many elites were known
      to have died out there, so it was too risky for him to do it, as well.
      Still, Han Sen needed to practice, and he didn’t dare slow down. He went
      as fast as he could.
    </p>
    <p>
      Even though the sanctuaries were open now, Stay Up Late said the creatures
      from the outside could not get in. But if that was true, that made Han Sen
      wonder how the crystallizers ended up getting destroyed.
    </p>
    <p>
      So, Han Sen did not feel too safe being inside the sanctuary. He kept on
      practicing. If something happened, having a great deal of power amassed
      would be the best thing.
    </p>
    <p>
      And Han Sen did not believe that the creatures from the outside could not
      get in. If they couldn’t, then how had the Nine-Life Cat entered and
      gained so much authority?
    </p>
    <p>
      The officer did not show up again. Aside from constant practice by
      himself, Han Sen also spent some time practicing with Stay Up Late and
      crystallizer technology. He also spent time learning about Heart Eye. He
      spent a whole month on that subject alone.
    </p>
    <p>
      If he had to go up against the officer again, there wouldn’t be much of a
      risk. He’d be able to use Heart Eye.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the officer did not show up. Han Sen wasn’t sure whether that was
      because the officer knew he was too weak to go up against him, or whether
      he had gone back to concocting a new scheme that would take some time.
    </p>
    <p>
      As Han Sen rested, he took time to investigate the Western King Sword. It
      was a crystallizer’s geno armor, like the glove and crystal shoes. Han Sen
      asked Stay Up Late what the difference between this geno armor and the
      others were.
    </p>
    <p>
      Stay Up Late did not know, though. He said every crystallizer could
      generate geno armor, but only the four kings could generate these special
      geno armors.
    </p>
    <p>
      The crystallizer glove and crystallizer shoes had wills of their own, but
      the Western King Sword seemed entirely inanimate. Han Sen could not sense
      that it had a will, and neither could he sense any special power it may
      have possessed.
    </p>
    <p>
      After Han Sen and Stay Up Late examined it, they thought the officer must
      have used a special method to combine the sword with himself. The sword
      had probably become lifeless because it was away from the officer.
    </p>
    <p>
      Han Sen had nothing to do right now, so he used the Blood-Pulse Sutra and
      dropped a smidgen of blood on the Western King Sword.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Real Blood geno core had become a part of who he was. It was in his
      blood, and Han Sen’s blood could therefore be called Real Blood. It was no
      weaker than the actual Real Blood geno core. And as Han Sen grew and
      became stronger, it would develop too.
