<h2>Xenogeneic Chase</h2>
<h3>Chapter 2398</h3>

<p>Han Sen and the others fell back. They immediately expanded
their King areas as they stared at the goose egg stone.</p>
<p>Katcha… Katcha…</p>
<p>More cracks opened across the surface of the goose egg stone.
The cracks were very well-aligned, so they obviously weren’t like
ordinary cracks one might find in a well-weathered stone. Instead,
the perfectly-spaced cracks opened straight up and down.</p>
<p>Boom!</p>
<p>Countless dark green claws emerged from the top and bottom of
the stone.</p>
<p>“Holy shit! That is a big bug!” Dragon Eight screamed with wide
eyes.</p>
<p>The stone might have looked rather like an egg, but the thing
inside it was definitely not a baby goose. It was actually a
xenogeneic bug, one that looked like a centipede. Its body was
curled around itself, so all its claws were hidden. It had simply
made itself look like a goose egg. Now, the disturbing creature was
stretching out its body, making itself look very scary in the
process. It revealed its teeth as it stared down on the Destroyed
and Dragon around it.</p>
<p>Blood and gore were smeared across the bug’s belly. It was
probably the remains of the missing Destroyed Kings.</p>
<p>Everyone still alive knew that somehow, this xenogeneic had
eaten more than fifty of the Destroyed Kings in a single second.
The realization was chilling. No one issued a command. Everyone,
including Han Sen and Dragon One, immediately turned and flew away.
They were going to leave Planet Dark Zone.</p>
<p>But just as they were about to fly up into the clouds, the whole
sky of the planet turned dark green. It was like a giant green
crystal had formed to cloak the entire planet. Even the small
amounts of light that made it through the clouds were dyed that
same greenish shade.</p>
<p>Pang!</p>
<p>Both the Destroyed group and the Dragon group fell from the sky
like meteors. They hit the planet so hard that their bodies punched
deep holes into the surface.</p>
<p>“Air-restriction area. With this kind of radius… it must be a
deified xenogeneic!” Dragon Eight pronounced as he climbed out of
his hole. His face looked grave.</p>
<p>“That isn’t an air-restriction area.” Han Sen looked glum, too.
He looked at the ground around them.</p>
<p>The area looked as if it had managed to cover the entire planet.
None of them could fly away now. Even more frightening was the fact
that this wasn’t just an air-restriction. It had another power,
too.</p>
<p>Before Han Sen could analyze it further, though, the giant
insect leaped forward. Its mountainous body moved with uncanny
speed, and dark green substance chains seethed in the air around
it. The chains wrapped around its entire body, their outer edges as
sharp as razors.</p>
<p>Han Sen used his Dongxuan Aura as he turned to run. He didn’t
dare use his Move Mountain Area; it would be totally useless
against a monster like this.</p>
<p>A xenogeneic like this had enough raw power to crush his Move
Mountain Area without breaking a sweat. His Dongxuan Armor wouldn’t
be able to withstand strength of that magnitude. He would die in
moments.</p>
<p>Boom!</p>
<p>The weird bug attacked. Two of the Kings were too close to the
creature to run, so they had no choice but to attack. They tried to
use their own powers to fight back against the insect, but the
weird bug was able to swallow them whole. The weird bug then dove
into the ground, vanishing under the surface and leaving a large
hole behind.</p>
<p>The ground shook beneath Han Sen like a violent earthquake. He
wanted to run, but after a few frantic steps, he came to a black
hole in the ground. A King running next to Han Sen was swallowed by
the insect as it launched itself up from that hole in the ground.
The weird bug hung in the air for a moment, then turned and dove
back under the earth.</p>
<p>“F*ck you!” Dragon Eight screamed when he saw the insect eat one
of the Dragons. It made him so angry that he used his giant gold
dragon. He sent a punch toward the pit in the ground.</p>
<p>Boom!</p>
<p>The hole collapsed on itself, and the weird bug didn’t come out
again. It didn’t scream, either.</p>
<p>“Careful!” Dragon One sprinted toward Dragon Eight and knocked
the man backward, then dodged away himself.</p>
<p>There was another boom as dirt and dust fountained up where
Dragon Eight had been standing only a moment before. There was now
another large hole, and the strange bug had reemerged. Half of its
body was above ground, and it looked like some strange tower as it
swung its claws.</p>
<p>No one moved to attack the creature; running was the only
thought on their minds. They all knew that fighting the beast would
be a useless move. There was nothing they could do against such a
scary deified xenogeneic.</p>
<p>Han Sen was running. And he was running very fast. He was very
good at fleeing impossible fights, and he was confident that he
could break the weird bug’s King area and leave Planet Dark
Zone.</p>
<p>Of course, he needed the bug to stop chasing him first. Even if
he could break the air-restriction area, he wouldn’t make it very
far if the bug was still pursuing him.</p>
<p>So, Han Sen put conscious effort into keeping a low profile. As
soon as he had the chance to, he would use his super god spirit to
leave Planet Dark Zone.</p>
<p>And in regards to the others, Han Sen could only pity them. At a
time like this, it was every man for himself. Han Sen was not their
daddy. There was no need to make a sacrifice on their behalf.</p>
<p>Han Sen’s face suddenly grew pale. The hair on the back of his
neck stood up, and his heart leaped into his throat.</p>
<p>Without hesitation, Han Sen used all his strength to leap
forward. The bug erupted up through the ground he had just been
standing on.</p>
<p>Han Sen’s body had almost touched its mouth, and the dark green
substance chains around the creature were like blades. One of them
brushed Han Sen’s leg, which was clad in the Dongxuan Armor. The
chain sliced cleanly through his Dongxuan Armor, leaving a deep
gash in Han Sen’s leg.Han Sen ignored the pain burning in his leg
and continued to run. If he stopped now, he would die.</p>
<p>The weird bug was back underground, though. It seemed to swim
under the ground like some sort of strange fish. Every time it came
out again, it left a ten-meter hole in its wake.</p>
<p>Perhaps it was because Han Sen’s leg was leaving a trail of
blood behind, but Han Sen noticed that the weird bug seemed to be
focusing all its attention on chasing him specifically.</p>
<p>“I cannot be this unlucky,” Han Sen thought, feeling sick. He
hoped he was wrong, but when that bug burst out of the ground right
next to him again, he knew that his hunch had been correct. The
insect was after him, and him alone.</p>
<p>“F*ck you!” Han Sen was slower than the weird bug, so he
wouldn’t be able to dodge the bug again. He flew into the sky, his
body releasing a white light. He was in super god spirit mode now,
and he avoided the weird bug’s gnashing teeth as he flew higher and
higher.</p>
<p>The bug didn’t seem to have any ranged attacks aside from its
King area, so Han Sen focused on flying as far away as he could.
But just as he thought he was about to leave the area, he heard a
buzzing sound.</p>
<p>Transparent wings had sprouted from the weird bug’s back. It
flew toward Han Sen at incredible speed, and within a single
second, it was right below Han Sen.</p>
<p>All of its dark green substance chains were knotted together,
spinning over each other like some enormous blender. The weird
bug’s open mouth was coming right for Han Sen. It was like a big
whale, ready to munch on a little fish.</p>
