After Han Sen returned to the shelter, he asked the Armored Man more about what happened.

Armored Man was very angry, and he had no way of releasing his rage. He started ranting, and Han Sen understood what had happened.

Armored Man was a born-emperor that was actually called Inferno Skeleton Emperor. Ancient Devil destroyed his shelter and claimed his spirit stone. He had no choice but to obey.

But after submitting to the service of Ancient Devil, he was placed inside a chimenea. While imprisoned, he was burned with ice and fire for a very long time. Inferno Skeleton Emperor could not die inside the chimenea, but he had to endure incredible agony the entire time.

Some urgent matter pulled Ancient Devil away, and he left. For a long time, it was only the guardian that was left there, so there was nothing Inferno Skeleton Emperor could do to escape.

But despite all that, he still earned something after the ordeal. During the time he spent in the chimenea, the emperor’s body was reinforced. He also learned to command the powers of ice and fire, as well. When he gained control of the chimenea, he absorbed much more ice and fire. That was how he had made himself an overwhelming contender in Divinity’s Bout.

But before he could gain his revenge and go up against Ancient Devil, Han Sen claimed him and trapped him inside Destiny’s Tower.

Armored Man didn’t know much about Headless Rockman and Destiny’s Tower, but he knew that the feud between Headless Rockman and Ancient had been going on since before he was forced to serve Ancient Devil.

One thing Han Sen learned, however, was that Ancient Devil was apparently afraid of Destiny’s Tower and Headless Rockman. And Ancient Devil was unable to defeat Headless Rockman who controlled it. When Inferno Skeleton Emperor was made free, so was Destiny’s Tower.

Inferno Skeleton Emperor knew that Ancient Devil was scared of Destiny’s Tower, so he wanted to take that tower with him in his pursuit of revenge. After trying many times, he finally managed to defeat Headless Rockman, but unfortunately, he did not receive the tower he had been so desperate for. Han Sen was the one who got it

“Let me out” Inferno Skeleton Emperor was raging. He hated Ancient Devil more than he hated Han Sen.

Han Sen kept him within Destiny’s Tower because his struggles had weakened him.

Han Sen ignored his repeated plight, but after a while, he said, “Although you are strong, you cannot beat Ancient Devil. But Ancient Devil, you said, could not kill Headless Rockman. Yet you managed to kill Headless Rockman. Perhaps he put you in the chimenea to strengthen you, so that he could use you to defeat the one opponent that he feared. Then, he could have Destiny’s Tower.”

Inferno Skeleton Emperor froze. His eyes flared with an icy fire, and he said, “Regardless of what his purpose was, I have to get my revenge. I have to kill him.”

“You can have your revenge, but he’s not here right now. There is no point of you conning out. And even if you did find him, there is no way you could catch up with the beast he rides. Even I was unable to chase him, and you’re not very speed- efficient. Or at least I don’t think you are,” Han Sen said.

After he heard that, Inferno Skeleton Emperor went silent. Then he got back to roaring.

“Wait a bit. If the opportunity arises, I’ll let you get the revenge you seek.” Han Sen provided him a little comfort. There really was a chance he could be a useful half-ally further down the road.

Inferno Skeleton Emperor’s physical power was most certainly as good as Ancient Devil’s. His strength must have become quite impressive over the years. Unfortunately, his skills were too simple. If he did go up against a mysterious elite like Ancient Devil, things would turn awry.

Not long after, Cheap Sheep appeared. He had come with a report, and he looked glum carrying it. He said a creature had just died inside the shelter. And now, all the creatures there were scared. No one knew who might be next.

Some creatures had even sneaked away from the shelter to escape, but their attempts hadn’t worked out. Elites were outside the shelter, so none of the escaping creatures made it very far.

Han Sen called a meeting in the spirit hall to discuss how they should proceed.

“Ancient Devil is scary, and we’re in a bad situation,” Gu Qingcheng said. “There is a limit to his power. He can kill one of us every day, but he won’t be able to select the target at will.”

“Even so, that is bad. If he kills one of us a day, it won’t take long for everyone to die.” Cheap Sheep sounded scared, and he was one of the weakest there. He could be brought down with ease.

“If you are afraid, go and obey Ancient Devil,” Han Sen told the sheep.

Cheap Sheep jumped up and said, “What is that supposed to mean? I am your sheep, and I always will be: dead or alive.”

Cheap Sheep wasn’t that loyal, though. There were so many people outside the shelter, he was just worried that if he did try to switch bosses, he’d be killed before he could explain himself. And right now, he thought Han Sen was just testing his loyalty.

Han Sen actually wanted Cheap Sheep could go and serve Ancient Devil as a boss. Perhaps there was a chance Ancient Devil could die before striking again.

But he knew there were too many elites out there, and Cheap Sheep was too weak to do much of anything. He’d probably be eaten before opening his mouth to speak. He wouldn’t even catch a glimpse of Ancient Devil’s face.

“It’s a shame Ancient Sky Mirror’s power is limited. Otherwise, I would go and fight them, and kill as many of them as I can,” Tang Zhenliu said.

While they were talking, Green Cow barged into the meeting and said, “Boss! The enemy is coming; they are almost before our shelter.”

Han Sen was surprised by this. He looked at Gu Qingcheng, Lin Feng, and the others.

If they were striking now, that meant they had found a way to ignore the Ancient Sky Mirror.

“If things go wrong, you guys all return to the Alliance. I’ll find a way to make it out of here,” Han Sen said to Lin Feng. Then, he ran out of the spirit hall.

The sky above the shelter was clouded by countless flying beasts, and creatures swarmed across the ground like the tumultuous waves of the sea.

There were so many scary lifeforces to be seen amidst them. And in the front, there was Ancient Devil and Sacred’s leader. And there were many more spirits and creatures Han Sen did not know. But even without knowing, Han Sen could tell they were things to fear.
