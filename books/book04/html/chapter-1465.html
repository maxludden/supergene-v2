      “This woman definitely didn’t create this sword skill. If she had, she
      wouldn’t be using it so angrily and allowing me to notice the unifying
      thread.” Han Sen was happy to learn this. That being said, he noticed it
      was only one branch of the greater trunk of the skill.
    </p>
    <p>
      This thread, the particular moveset he was tracking, was like the starting
      point of a ball of twine. From this, Han Sen could unravel it all, bit by
      bit, and get to the core of what lay under the hood of the skill.
    </p>
    <p>
      But it wasn’t easy, and the fight between sword and umbrella had cost Han
      Sen a lot of blood. Although the fight was going much better for the woman
      than it was for him, that didn’t quell the fire of excitement that burned
      in his heart.
    </p>
    <p>
      And now, as the fight continued to rage, the secrets of her techniques
      unraveled. His understanding was increasing as they fought. It was very
      lucky for Han Sen to discover a skill that suited him so well, with his
      mastery of the Dongxuan Sutra and Heavenly Go.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Dongxuan Sutra and Heavenly Go weren’t lethal attacks. They applied to
      the user’s versatility and movement. Han Sen had always wanted to find a
      hyper geno art that went well with these two techniques.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now, seeing this woman’s skills, he giddily concluded that his desire was
      about to be fulfilled. Once he learned the skill, it would only require
      small modifications. After that, it’d fit his usage of the Dongxuan Sutra
      and Heavenly Go like a glove.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was like cooking, he thought. The Dongxuan Sutra and Heavenly Go were
      like cooking techniques that allowed for the preparation of delicious
      food.
    </p>
    <p>
      But to formulate a feast, you needed ingredients. You couldn’t have a
      feast with just rice on offer.
    </p>
    <p>
      The woman’s sword skill was a bounty of different ingredients, all of the
      highest quality. With the cooking skills of the Dongxuan Sutra and
      Heavenly Go, whatever he produced was sure to be momentous.
    </p>
    <p>
      Although the woman fought hard, he suspected there was a note of restraint
      in her movements. It didn’t seem as if she wanted to kill him.
    </p>
    <p>
      If she explicitly wanted to kill him, he wouldn’t have lasted against her
      with his unfinished Heart Sword.
    </p>
    <p>
      And if the woman had truly wanted Han Sen dead, he wouldn’t have stuck to
      making use of Heart Sword, either. His Double Fly was not as complicated
      as her skill, but its simplicity meant he could fight and challenge her
      almost as an equal.
    </p>
    <p>
      The woman noticed Han Sen’s simmering excitement as they fought, despite
      the injuries he had incurred. She was surprised, and his unexpected
      reaction made her anger subside a little.
    </p>
    <p>
      And then, all of a sudden, she noticed the sword skills Han Sen was
      employing had changed. The skills he was now using were similar to the
      ones she employed herself.
    </p>
    <p>
      The woman was shocked. “He is practically making use of Ghost Sword! Ghost
      Sword Priest was the very first swordmaster of the Elysium. He spent a
      thousand years crafting the basis of this technique, and he spent many
      more years modifying it further. When Ghost Sword Priest taught me, it
      took me an entire year just to get a handle on it. How is this human
      learning it so swiftly?”
    </p>
    <p>
      The woman could not allow herself to believe Han Sen was actually using
      Ghost Sword, but after some time passed, the expression on her face become
      more and more complicated.
    </p>
    <p>
      She couldn’t let herself believe that he was using Ghost Sword, but his
      moves had echoed her own for so long, it was unmistakably similar.
    </p>
    <p>
      Han Sen was replicating the woman’s precise techniques shortly after she
      used them.
    </p>
    <p>
      To make things worse, she realized that Han Sen was not only copying her,
      but performing the very same skill to an even better degree.
    </p>
    <p>
      It wasn’t that Han Sen had changed the core skill; it was just that when
      Han Sen used Ghost Sword, his timings were far more precise and his
      accuracy and precision were flawless.
    </p>
    <p>
      Han Sen had been losing, but when he started making use of her skill, he
      fared much better. They were locked in a stalemate, as far as she could
      tell.
    </p>
    <p>
      The woman was in absolute shock. She finally accepted that Han Sen was
      indeed using Ghost Sword and that this was something he had learned
      directly from her.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Did you learn a sword skill such as this before our encounter?” the woman
      asked Han Sen, leaping away from the fight.
    </p>
    <p>“Kind of.” Han Sen nodded.</p>
    <p>
      Han Sen had never actually learned Ghost Sword, of course, but he could
      replicate the primal essence of the skill. Through his proficiency with
      Heavenly Go and the Dongxuan Sutra, he was able to learn Ghost Sword with
      relative ease. He just had to get to grips with the underlying rule and
      thread that connected it all.
    </p>
    <p>
      If Han Sen hadn’t learned those two, he would never have been able to
      start casting Ghost Sword in the manner he just had. This wasn’t a skill
      you could just pick up, remember, and use. The complicated movements the
      skill required were just one of the many bases you had to cover.
    </p>
    <p>
      The woman looked at Han Sen with a confused expression. She opened her
      umbrella and spun it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Han Sen then felt as if something was sucking him. It lasted a while, and
      when the suction was gone, he found himself standing before the rock. The
      woman was where she always had been, standing solemnly on a bridge.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Don’t tell Gu Qingcheng you entered the Avoid Worldstone.” The woman’s
      voice rang out from the stone.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Who is Gu Qingcheng? Are you referring to that woman?” Han Sen snapped
      out of his daze and looked straight at the green-clothed woman.
    </p>
    <p>
      Han Sen knew she wasn’t the mystic woman, despite their appearance being
      nearly identical. They were very different people on the inside.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Didn’t she tell you?” The stone continued to sound with the green-clothed
      woman’s voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      “No. This is the first time I’ve heard her name.” Han Sen stared at the
      woman in the painting, and after a bit, he asked her, “Who are you, then?
      Gu Qingcheng’s twin sister?”
    </p>
    <p>
      There was no response. It didn’t seem as if she was prepared to answer
      him.
    </p>
    <p>
      “The mystic woman is called Gu Qingcheng? It’s a name that certainly
      sounds human. I’ve never heard of a spirit or creature possessing the name
      Gu. Dark Spirit uses the name Ling and Elysium folk use Ghost, so I don’t
      think Gu is something that would be used by spirits or creatures,” Han Sen
      reckoned to himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Who is the green-clothed woman, then? Is she a sister or a straight-up
      doppelganger of Gu Qingcheng? Or is she just a spirit inside a painting?
      And why won’t she let me tell Gu Qingcheng I entered the painting?” Han
      Sen’s mind was filled with a number of questions. He continued to look at
      the green-clothed woman, but she was still facing away from him.
