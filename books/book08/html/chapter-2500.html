<p>“The fact that you studied on Extreme Mountain is none of my
business,” Han Sen thought. “If you want a risky fight, there are
xenogeneics everywhere. Why pick on me? I killed that worthless Bai
Yi, and now the Extreme King want me dead. But if I had killed this
much-loved boy Bai Wuchang, King Bai would likely come after me
himself. Why am I considered the one who started all this?”</p>
<p>But Bai Wuchang wasn’t going to give him the chance to stop
fighting. The prince was raging more and more. The ghost-like body
became solid, but something about it still seemed incorporeal.
Looking at it was like looking at an illusion.</p>
<p>Han Sen frowned. Bai Wuchang’s blue knife darkened to black. It
felt as if some black substance chains were writhing just under the
surface.</p>
<p>“What kind of knife skills are these? They’re going to produce
substance chains just like the black tiger I met previously.
Although the substance chains haven’t fully formed yet, if he can
manage to do this, Bai Wuchang has a ninety percent chance of
becoming deified,” Han Sen thought as he observed Bai Wuchang.</p>
<p>Bai Wuchang’s eyes were on fire. His gaze was invasive as it
crept over Han Sen. “The road up Extreme Mountain is arduous. There
is a ninety percent chance of dying, and there is only a ten
percent chance of surviving. The gambit’s rewards, however, are
very big. I earned Extreme Mountain’s prestigious skill called Big
Universe Extreme Dead God Light. One hit can destroy everything, so
you better watch it!”</p>
<p>“Can I not, please?” Han Sen asked, looking frustrated.</p>
<p>“No.” When Bai Wuchang answered, he was already attacking.</p>
<p>The black knife’s light came at Han Sen. There was no stopping
it. It was like the knife had never even moved. The moment the
knife light appeared was the moment it was inside Han Sen’s
body.</p>
<p>“It is the same as the Blood-Pulse Sutra’s self-cogwheel. It is
a power that can affect the self-cogwheels of other creatures.” Han
Sen was shocked. Because it was used directly on his self-cogwheel,
the strike was almost impossible to dodge. It was a devastating
attack.</p>
<p>But it was different from the Blood-Pulse Sutra. The Blood-Pulse
Sutra pushed the self-cogwheels of others. Bai Wuchang’s knife
light destroyed the self-cogwheels of others.</p>
<p>If the self-cogwheel was broken, that meant the person would be
almost dead, and their lifeforce would be gone.</p>
<p>Dodging that blow wouldn’t be difficult if he was farther away
from Bai Wuchang; as the distance between them increased, the
effect on Han Sen’s self-cogwheel would be weakened. That meant the
strike would be weaker.</p>
<p>But Han Sen hadn’t known Bai Wuchang could unleash a strike such
as this. He was too close to Bai Wuchang. It was too late to dodge
now, so he had no choice but to accept that hit.</p>
<p>A power inside Han Sen’s body moved. A self-cogwheel was
spinning. That cogwheel was flashing with a weird symbol. It was
The Story of Genes’ self-cogwheel.</p>
<p>Bai Wuchang’s black knife light went into him and struck his
self-cogwheel, but it was unable to move Han Sen’s self-cogwheel.
The black knife hit the self-cogwheel and broke. It shattered into
chunks of a black substance, then dissolved.</p>
<p>“It looks like your skill is nothing substantial,” Han Sen said
to Bai Wuchang, who looked frozen.</p>
<p>“No… impossible…” Bai Wuchang stared at Han Sen in disbelief.
Han Sen was at the perfect distance for him to use his Big Universe
Extreme Dead God Light.</p>
<p>At this distance, Bai Wuchang believed that he could eliminate
any being in the universe that was beneath the deified level. Even
killing a half-deified would die as easy as chopping the head off a
chicken. Both would die in one hit.</p>
<p>But Han Sen had been hit by the strongest unleashing of his Big
Universe Extreme Dead God Light, and nothing had happened. Bai
Wuchang could scarcely believe it.</p>
<p>Although Bai Wuchang couldn’t see self-cogwheels, he knew that
the Big Universe Extreme Dead God Light was a very mysterious and
scary power. It ignored all types of defenses to kill the lifeforce
directly.</p>
<p>Han Sen simply wasn’t affected by the Big Universe Extreme Dead
God Light.</p>
<p>As Bai Wuchang stared at Han Sen’s motionless form, he stopped
swinging. He just gripped his knife, unsure of what to do.</p>
<p>“Do you want to keep going?” Han Sen asked, looking at Bai
Wuchang.</p>
<p>“I lose, but next time…” Before Bai Wuchang could finish, Han
Sen interrupted violently.</p>
<p>“Next time, my f*cking *ss!” Han Sen jumped forward. He leaped
in front of Bai Wuchang and punched him square in the face. A scary
power caved-in Bai Wuchang’s entire skull. Blood squelched from the
mashed-in face and around Han Sen’s fist. Bai Wuchang was sent
flying.</p>
<p>Han Sen followed after the soaring victim. His fists and legs
were like a storm, raining down blows on Bai Wuchang.</p>
<p>Han Sen was enraged, and there was no stopping him now. Bai
Wuchang’s flesh tore and his bones shattered under the assault. He
couldn’t even fight back as Han Sen beat his body to a pulp.</p>
<p>“You’re a crazy madman! You think you’re so strong, don’t you?
You think you can do anything you want just because you’re King
Bai’s son!” Han Sen kept speaking as he punched. His fists kept
landing on Bai Wuchang’s face, utterly annihilating his skull. The
man’s eyeballs were squashed, and his nose was reversed into what
was left of his face.</p>
<p>Han Sen was still so angry. He kept punching like mad, breaking
all of the other man’s bones. Bai Wuchang screamed until he could
scream no longer.</p>
<p>Fang Qing Yu and the pirates were all frozen. That was King
Bai’s favorite son. Han Sen had killed Bai Yi, which led to a
universal APB being put on him. If he killed Bai Wuchang, King Bai
would come after him personally.</p>
<p>Bai Wuchang’s Ghost King Body, his Ghost Knife skills, and his
Big Universe Extreme Dead God Light were so strong. But he was too
focused on power. His techniques, his strength, and his timing with
areas were shoddy.</p>
<p>He was able to destroy enemies that couldn’t defeat his powers.
But if he met someone as strong as him, he would end up getting
crushed.</p>
<p>Han Sen grabbed Bai Wuchang and lifted him like a sack of wet
mud. He carried the man back to the white whale. Han Sen tossed him
down, and blood sprayed everywhere when the Extreme King prince hit
the floor in a boneless heap.</p>
<p>Fang Qing Yu and the pirates stared at Bai Wuchang on the floor.
He didn’t look human anymore. If not for his Ghost King Body, he
would have been killed.</p>
<p>All of the pirates were thinking, “He could have offended anyone
but this guy. I can’t believe he even beat up King Bai’s favorite
son so badly. There’s no one he wouldn’t dare to punch.”</p>
<p>“Lock him up. Take him as a hostage. If the Extreme King people
still dare come for us, I will cut his head off.” Han Sen’s face
was as hard a granite.</p>
<p>Rage still boiled through Han Sen. He had met many fighting
maniacs in his time, like Lone Bamboo. But even Lone Bamboo had his
limits. This Bai Wuchang, however, was all about killing. He didn’t
have a reason, and he didn’t need one. It was all about killing for
him.</p>
<p>Fortunately, Han Sen’s self-cogwheel was as hard as it was. And
he had the Eternity solidifying powers. The self-cogwheels of
ordinary creatures would have been destroyed by Bai Wuchang’s
strike. If a person’s self-cogwheel broke, then they were
essentially dead. The state they were left in was worse than being
a vegetable.</p>
