  The body of the Blood God Mantis was only a tenth of the size of the plant it was munching. It ate slowly, but when it ate a bit of the coral, its belly did not swell. Its body did glow strangely, however.

Before it finished eating the red coral, another aspect of its body changed. The shadow of a red reaper appeared on it. Its hands held a scythe, like a tool to harvest souls.

The mist on the shadow was getting stronger, and it looked as if it was set to become solid.

“It’s evolving. Will it become a Marquise or a mutant?” Han Sen asked as he looked upon the Blood God Mantis.

“Spirits are just substances formed of light, smoke, and air. They aren’t really solid. When they become Marquise, they won’t grow any more solid than they were originally. They will only gain power. Look at the Red God Mantis. It’s not becoming a Marquise; it’s mutating,” Yun Suyi said.

“It is good to be a mutant. I love mutants.” Han Sen smiled.

The Blood God Mantis’ red smoke was getting heavier. The red smoke reaper could be seen clearly now. At this point, it was hard to distinguish from an actual creature.

The next second, Han Sen saw the red reaper wave its scythe towards the red coral. It broke the rest of the red coral, and then the red smoke on its body became a vortex. It sucked all the scattered pieces into it.

When the red coral entered the whirl, the red reaper’s smoke became thicker. That was particularly true of the scythe in its hands. Its smoke form began to solidify, and before long, it had turned into a crystal blade.

The Blood God Mantis’ body was shining. The light glowed through the red reaper.

Han Sen was staring into Blood God Mantis’ body, focusing on the blood air that swirled inside.

“It is going to finish mutating. Now is the best chance,” Yun Suyi said.

“There’s no rush; let’s keep watching.” Han Sen wanted to see what the Blood God Mantis’ geno art might be. He wanted to see how strong it was.

After two hours, the Blood God Mantis finished the mutation process. The red reaper became smoke, then drew back into its body. It vanished from sight.

Blood God Mantis’ body did not grow large from ingesting the coral. It was still one foot long, and its body still looked like ruby.

Then, all of a sudden, it flapped its wings and squealed. It suddenly came for Han Sen, fast as a red shadow.

Perhaps it had noticed Han Sen and Yun Suyi a while ago. It might have refrained from attacking then due to the fact that it was undergoing the evolution process. Once it was done, it now fancied killing them.

“Spell,” Han Sen said quietly. Then, Spell appeared before him in her ladylike form. She wielded two pistols, and she fired at the Blood God Mantis with both.

Pang! Pang!

Two bullets hit the Blood God Mantis, but they didn’t break its shell. They only left two spell markings on it.

Blood God Mantis squealed with anger. Its body turned into a red shadow, and it leaped at Spell. The arms of the Mantis swung like scythes, and they were going to cut her.

Spell moved quickly, evading Blood God Mantis’ attack. She held her hands together and summoned a rocket launcher. Then, she fired a shot at the Blood God Mantis.

Han Sen frowned. He didn’t know why Spell was using a rocket launcher right now. The rocket launcher was stronger than the pistols, yes, but it was too slow. With the speed of the Blood God Mantis, the creature could easily dodge.

And yes, Blood God Mantis did indeed flap its wings to dodge upwards. It got well clear of the rocket. It then resumed its approach to Spell.

Spell retreated, still clutching the rocket launcher. The Blood God Mantis continued to advance, but the rocket that had gone by suddenly swung around like a heat-seeking missile. It hit the mantis in the back.

Boom!

There was an explosion, and Blood God Mantis’ body was sent flying away. Its shell was covered in a number of small wounds. The rocket must have damaged its shell when it detonated.

But those wounds were nothing to the mantis. They only made it angry. It squealed, then jumped back at Spell.

“Damn! The round that leaves a mark can track an enemy’s movement. It alters the course of the rocket. I wonder if the bullets can have a similar function?” Han Sen thought to himself.

Swiftly, Han Sen’s question was answered. Spell turned the rocket launcher into a pair of pistols again. Her legs were crossed as she dodged Blood God Mantis’ attack. It was like she was performing a beautiful and elegant dance.

In that elegant dance, Spell’s pistols fired continuously. It did not look like she was aiming at the Blood God Mantis, but the bullets drew a curve in the sky. And then, they all landed on the mantis. The rounds did not miss a single mark across the mantis’ body.

“So the pistol bullets can track too, huh?” Han Sen was so happy.

Yun Suyi looked at the scene strangely. Spell was just a geno armament, yet she was capable of fighting a mutant Earl without any directions from her master. Normal geno armaments were not capable of something like that. In fact, most Earl geno armaments could not fight at all. They didn’t have a will of their own. They did not have intelligence like Spell did.

The pistols were a little weak. They hit the same spots on Blood God Mantis, but they failed to heavily damage it.

Blood God Mantis tried to attack Spell, but it failed. After Spell drew some distance between the two, she summoned her sniper rifle. She wanted to get rough. But before Spell could fire the sniper rifle, a strange red smoke suddenly appeared behind her back. A crystal scythe was sweeping down towards her neck.

Han Sen used his mind to make Spell quickly dodge, but it was too late. The crystal scythe slashed across her back. Her white armor was cut into by an inch, and it sliced open the muscles in her back deep enough to reveal bone.

Fortunately, Spell was not a living creature. She had no blood to lose.

After Spell was attacked, she moved forward. The Blood God Mantis screamed, and it jumped forward. The red reaper followed her from behind, and they attacked her together.

“Now that the Blood God Mantis has mutated, it can create a spirit that works like a fellow xenogeneic? This is similar to a summon skill,” Han Sen thought.

Yun Suyi, seeing Spell in danger, quickly said, “What do we do now?”

“Kill it,” Han Sen said coldly. He had already drawn Ghost Teeth Knife from his waist.
