  The attack did not look like Gu Qingcheng’s swordlight, which was obviously ridiculously powerful. But that was the good thing about Han Sen’s attack; it looked simple, but it left Ancient Devil with no option other than receiving the strike.

Han Sen still didn’t know how Ancient Devil had killed Bone Witch. Killing him would prevent him from harming any more of the inhabitants of Han Sen’s shelter.

The white donkey Ancient Devil was riding, however, moved and dodged the attack. It made Han Sen freeze.

Han Sen was great at prediction and judgment, and that strike had been set up a string of events that would lead to one singular outcome. It made sure Ancient Devil would have to get hit.

But now the white donkey had broken this. It had subverted his predictions. This was not something Han Sen expected would happen.

Han Sen knew it was hard to predict stuff, and he knew not to be arrogant enough to claim that he could predict everything. He would, of course, get things wrong occasionally.

Han Sen attacked Ancient Devil without reprieve. Every strike used Han Sen’s prediction and judgment to the max. Every strike was delivered to Ancient Devil with a rhythm.

But Ancient Devil sat perfectly still. It was the donkey that kept moving its legs to avoid Han Sen’s strikes. The donkey moved like it was performing ballet It kept on dodging Han Sen’s attacks.

Han Sen looked glum, and this actually surprised Queen.

Queen thought Han Sen used Heavenly Go very well. It was perfect, as far as she could see, but the donkey somehow always managed to dodge him. It always found somewhere Han Sen hadn’t calculated and avoided a strike by the Split- Blade.

“This donkey is nothing simple. Does it have power like the Dongxuan Sutra, that allows it to predict things?” Han Sen thought to himself as he continued to swing his blade.

Somewhere far away, up in the mountains, the leader of Sacred watched the fight alongside a number of elders.

“Ancient Devil is strong. It is no wonder he crushed Six Paths before. Even just his pet is able to do that,” an elder complimented the spectacle.

Sacred’s leader laughed and said, “Don’t underestimate that beast. It is a born-berserk super creature. It was born with an invincible ability. Skysword won’t hit it. Not even Dollar could, if he was here.”

“If it is so strong, how come we have never heard about it before?” The elder looked at the white donkey in shock.

“It followed Ancient Devil immediately after its birth, and it has never really shown its powers to others. I only saw its powers in God’s Ruin, when I explored it alongside Ancient Devil,” Sacred’s leader said.

“That means Ancient Devil cannot lose. Let’s see how he might strike back.” Elder Yin looked at Ancient Devil, and went on to say, “Ancient Devil is a special person. He was able to circumvent the power of Ancient Sky Mirror and gain the loyalty of this mount We just don’t know if he can defeat Skysword. We don’t know if he can win.”

“Why is he not striking?” Ghost Eagle Emperor frowned.

“He is watching and evaluating Skysword’s power. When he does choose to strike, he’ll kill his enemy. It looks like he is almost done watching, though. He will strike soon,” Sacred’s leader said.

“Weird. Why doesn’t he fight back?” Cheap Sheep asked.

The white donkey kept on dodging, and even Cheap Sheep noticed what was going on.

“It’s not that he doesn’t want to strike, it’s just that he can’t.” Queen looked across the arena. “He can dodge Han Sen’s attack, but Han Sen’s own formation is not exposed. He can’t find a chance to fight back himself. All he can do is wait.”

Queen was familiar with Han Sen’s skills, so she was able to speak for him.

“Does that mean we can’t find out who is winning?” Cheap Sheep sounded quite happy. He originally thought that Han Sen was having trouble just fighting Ancient Devil’s pet, which would indicate that Han Sen was likely to lose.

“No, Han Sen is still at a disadvantage,” Gu Qingcheng said suddenly.

Queen and the others turned to look at Gu Qingcheng. Queen understood some of Han Sen’s abilities, but she was not super class. There was something she was missing.

Gu Qingcheng looked grim, and she said, “Han Sen hasn’t exposed anything, which is why Ancient Devil hasn’t attacked. That means he is at a disadvantage.”

“Sister Cheng, could you explain that with a little more clarity?” Wang Yuhang couldn’t help but ask.

Gu Qingcheng looked over to their fight and said, “Han Sen’s attacks don’t aren’t allowing an opening because he keeps striking. The attacks are too continuous to allow a response.”

Queen understood and said, “That means Han Sen is forced to attack, and if he stops, he’ll be attacked by Ancient Devil.”

Gu Qingcheng nodded and said, “Ancient Devil is like a viper in a cave. If Han Sen’s attacks develop a flaw, things could get ugly.”

“That’s easy. He can just keep on attacking until he kills the enemy,” Cheap Sheep said.

“It’s not that easy, and Han Sen can’t touch Ancient Devil. And the beast has a strange power. It won’t be weaker than any elite,” Gu Qingcheng said.

While they were talking, Han Sen’s body stopped for a moment At that moment, Ancient Devil attacked.

The hand he held against his chest was pressing forward towards Han Sen. It felt as if the entire world rested in that palm.

One flower, one world. One leaf, one bodhi. Ancient Devil’s hand was like a hand that was picking up flowers. It felt like the entire world was in his palms.

Han Sen’s eyes looked clear, though. He wasn’t afraid of this move, and in fact, he had been waiting for it.

As Han Sen was waiting to strike, he felt a movement inside his Sea of Soul.
