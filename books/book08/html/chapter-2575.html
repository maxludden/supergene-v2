<h2>Geno Art Swapped for Fruit</h2>
<h3>Chapter 2575</h3>

<p>The Very High were admired by all. No matter where Exquisite and
Li Keer went, they were as popular as the stars and the moon.</p>
<p>Even when the Extreme King’s princes and princesses met with
them, the royal children would be extra polite to them. They would
treat the two Very High like VIPs at all times, not willing to do
anything that might offend them.</p>
<p>Now, they had been reduced to this. The crocodiles were treating
them like lowly slaves, whereas Dollar was able to eat nice food
and drink lovely beverages all day long. He made no effort to help
them out. He never shared his food or did much with them.</p>
<p>Exquisite and Li Keer hadn’t brought much food of their own.
After all, they had God’s Wander. They could use Galaxy Teleport to
grab what they needed whenever they wanted. They didn’t have to
bring simple necessities like food with them. But they had finished
all their reserves, and there was nothing more for them in that
place. They could last another two or three months by consuming the
energy stored in their bodies, but they still wanted to eat food.
It was in the nature of their bodies, and they couldn’t help
it.</p>
<p>Exquisite was faring a little better. She had trained her Very
High Sense for a long time, so her detachment from personal
connections, known as Forget Love, was at a very high level. It
helped her separate herself from worldly desires. Li Keer, however,
was in dire straits. She couldn’t control her temptation for
food.</p>
<p>“Dollar, can you sell us some of your food?” Li Keer asked Han
Sen, chewing her lip distractedly.</p>
<p>“Sure. What would you like to buy? Grilled chicken or grilled
goose? Roast lamb or roast pork? You can have something that flies
and something that swims. I have everything you could ever need,”
Han Sen said expansively, agreeing to the request with haste.</p>
<p>“There is no need to go to such trouble. Just giving us some of
that fruit will do.” Li Keer said, eying Han Sen’s plate that was
stuffed with fresh peaches.</p>
<p>The Very High were like a mix between the Sky and humans. They
would kill if they had to, but they wouldn’t kill for no reason.
They didn’t like to waste or take lives without purpose.</p>
<p>The chicken that Han Sen was eating smelled nice, but it
wouldn’t provide much energy. There was no point in eating it, so
eating the fruit would be better.</p>
<p>“Sure. One fruit meal for a geno art.” Han Sen picked up a peach
that was bigger than his fist, and he smiled at Li Keer.</p>
<p>“Why don’t you just mug me, instead?” Li Keer’s eyes opened wide
at Han Sen. She couldn’t believe her ears.</p>
<p>The peach was a xenogeneic plant’s fruit, but it wasn’t
high-level. Far from it. The fruit was probably ranked no higher
than Baron. Swapping a fruit like that for a geno art was
practically daylight robbery.</p>
<p>“It’s up to you. I’m not the one who suggested a trade.” Han Sen
shrugged and began munching on the peach. Juice dribbled from the
peach as he bit into it, and a delectable fragrance came wafting
out of it.</p>
<p>“Okay. That branch of fruit for a geno art. I will make the
trade.” Li Keer gritted her teeth and thought to herself, “We, the
Very High, have a lot of geno arts. I know enough of them to kill
you. If I just give you one random art after another, I will take
all of your fruit.”</p>
<p>“Wait, I have a condition. The geno art you give me must be one
I’ve never learned before,” Han Sen said.</p>
<p>He was scamming Exquisite and Li Keer, and he wouldn’t feel a
tiny bit sorry for doing so.</p>
<p>Han Sen had believed them to be Sky, and he hadn’t minded
helping them. Now that he knew they were from the Very High, his
feelings toward them had changed.</p>
<p>Any of the Very High in the core area wouldn’t require his help
to kill a bronze tripod or a deified xenogeneic. That was just
impossible to believe. He knew they were up to something,
considering the way they had behaved around him.</p>
<p>If they had some sort of ulterior motive, then there was no need
for Han Sen to be polite with them. He was going to scam them
without remorse.</p>
<p>If he hadn’t learned who they were, Han Sen would have given
them the fruit for free. The fruit wasn’t worth much to him, after
all.</p>
<p>“How am I supposed to know what you have learned, and how am I
supposed to know what you can or cannot learn?” Li Keer lifted her
lips.</p>
<p>“Tell me the geno art’s name and what it can be used for. I can
figure it out for myself,” Han Sen said without moving.</p>
<p>“Okay. Have you heard of the geno art Dragon Blood Evilbreaker?
I can swap that geno art in exchange for your peach,” Li Keer said
carefully.</p>
<p>Dragon Blood Evilbreaker was a secret geno art belonging to the
Dragon, and outsiders were not permitted to read and learn its
secrets. The Very High, however, were an exception to that
rule.</p>
<p>The Very High had selected many Dragons for silkworms, and many
of those Dragons possessed knowledge of Dragon Blood Evilbreaker.
The Very High could sense their progress with it, and see into the
secrets shrouding Dragon Blood Evilbreaker.</p>
<p>In truth, the same principle applied to all races across the
whole geno universe. The secrets of each individual race’s geno
arts meant little before the Very High. They could see through
everything.</p>
<p>It was just as Li Keer said. The number of geno arts she knew
about could kill Han Sen. It would be no trouble, and she could
easily bring out a few hundred.</p>
<p>The Very High had a rule about not teaching others the geno arts
that they had collected. They had many geno arts from many races.
In some ways, their race was like an encyclopedia of geno arts.</p>
<p>Of course, it didn’t matter how many geno arts she had; Li Keer
would not sell them out easily. She knew she would soon have Han
Sen as her silkworm, and so she wasn’t all that worried.</p>
<p>Even so, Li Keer was only going to present him with the geno
arts of outsiders for now. She wasn’t willing to leak the secret
geno arts that belonged to the Very High.</p>
<p>Plus, Dragon Blood Evilbreaker required the blood of the Dragon
race to practice. She decided to mention that one in particular
because she didn’t think Han Sen could make use of it. She wanted
to dishearten him.</p>
<p>“Fine. Then I will accept the Dragon Blood Evilbreaker.” Han Sen
agreed to it quickly and tossed her a peach.</p>
<p>Han Sen had seen Dragon One use Dragon Blood Evilbreaker, and he
thought it was a pretty decent geno art. It was similar to Saving
Money. He didn’t know if he could practice it, but simply hearing
about it would be helpful.</p>
<p>“You really want to learn Dragon Blood Evilbreaker?” Li Keer was
shocked. She then remembered that Dollar had somehow been able to
learn Big Destroyed. With that thought, she considered the
possibility that he might actually be able to learn Dragon Blood
Evilbreaker. It made her hesitate.</p>
<p>The Very High were strict about their rules. Although they had
thousands of geno arts, with many coming from other races, they
weren’t allowed to leak them to others. Teaching someone an
ordinary geno art would be okay, but Dragon Blood Evilbreaker was a
secret skill of the Dragons. If the details of the geno art became
common knowledge, it could affect the Dragons. That was something
the Very High didn’t want to see.</p>
<p>“Are you just saying whatever you can to get the fruit? Are you
hesitating because you don’t actually know Dragon Blood
Evilbreaker?” Han Sen saw Li Keer hesitate. His expression looked
something like a smile, but it wasn’t pleasant at all.</p>
<p>“Of course I know Dragon Blood Evilbreaker, but…” Li Keer knew
Han Sen was provoking her, but she still hesitated.</p>
<p>“Make the exchange,” Exquisite said suddenly.</p>
<p>“Third Sister, I’m not sure that’s a good idea,” Li Keer said to
Exquisite.</p>
<p>“It’s fine. I want to see if he can learn Dragon Blood
Evilbreaker,” Exquisite said smoothly. Her eyes looked so
strange.</p>
<p>Li Keer nodded and turned back to Han Sen. “Alright. I will swap
Dragon Blood Evilbreaker for the fruit. Listen closely, because I’m
only going to tell you once.”</p>
<p>Han Sen perked his ears and focused on the skill that Li Keer
began to explain. He didn’t know if he could learn it, but he did
know that Dragon Blood Evilbreaker was a high-quality art.</p>
