<p>Han Sen followed Bao’er’s instructions when she told him where
to look. Amidst that clump of mushrooms was a small clump of grass
that didn’t look particularly outstanding.</p>
<p>The grass was only three or four centimeters tall. It was very,
very small, and it appeared rugged and yellow. It looked as if it
had dried up and died. If Bao’er hadn’t pointed it out, Han Sen
wouldn’t have noticed it.</p>
<p>“You want to eat that grass?” Han Sen looked at Bao’er with
shock. And he thought to himself, “Since when has Bao’er changed
her appetite? I thought she only ate sweets.”</p>
<p>“Not the grass. There is something below it,” Bao’er said
quietly.</p>
<p>“Below?” Han Sen looked at the grass and instantly realized what
she meant. The grass was probably similar to the greens of a
carrot. The root of the plant was the useful part.</p>
<p>Han Sen stopped hesitating and began using his Ghost Teeth Knife
to cut a path to the tiny patch of grass. He swung his knife and
cut down some of the toxic purple mushrooms.</p>
<p>King class xenogeneic plants were nothing to Han Sen. One life,
one mushroom. He even cut down apart their roots.</p>
<p>The toxic mushrooms released their toxic mist, but Han Sen used
an icy light to block it. Although the King class toxic mist was
very strong, it couldn’t harm Han Sen.</p>
<p>“Xenogeneic King hunted: Toxic Umbrella Mushroom. Xenogeneic
gene found.”</p>
<p>Han Sen was a little bit surprised. The purple mushrooms really
were xenogeneics, and they were King class, as well.</p>
<p>“If Night River King’s diary’s coded creatures were toxic
umbrella mushrooms, then that means something must have affected
them. And that was why they became King class. That might also mean
they weren’t originally King class. But if this is so, what
affected them? Could it be that wilted grass?” Han Sen thought to
himself.</p>
<p>“Xenogeneic King hunted: Toxic Umbrella Mushroom. Xenogeneic
gene found. Obtained Toxic Umbrella Mushroom beast soul.”</p>
<p>Once Han Sen had killed thirty of the mushrooms, he earned a
King class beast soul. That was surprising.</p>
<p>The mushrooms were King class, and yet, they were unable to
move. Their only talent was the ability to release toxic spores
that were ineffective against someone like Han Sen.</p>
<p>Han Sen quickly cleared the rest of them out and earned two
Toxic Umbrella Mushroom beast souls.</p>
<p>That surprised Han Sen. They were weapon beast souls, but right
now, Han Sen didn’t have time to stop and give them a closer
look.</p>
<p>Once all the mushrooms were gone, Han Sen used his knife to dig
around the wilted grass. He wanted to see what lay below.</p>
<p>“Do you guys know what kind of plant that is?” King Bai asked,
looking at the Extreme King elites around him.</p>
<p>Everyone could tell that Han Sen’s objective was to dig out
something that lay below, but they all looked confused. None of
them knew what the grass was.</p>
<p>Even the xenogeneic mushrooms Han Sen had killed were unknown to
them. They had no clue what they were.</p>
<p>Many plants were oh-so-very weird, all across the geno universe,
so it wasn’t strange that none of King Bai’s attendants could
identify the mushrooms. Even deified elites were unable to
recognize all the plants that they encountered.</p>
<p>But they were confused, too. They didn’t know how Han Sen had
known there were xenogeneic plants just lying around in that
precise spot.</p>
<p>As Han Sen kept slicing and dicing, digging through the ground,
he saw something purple appear below. At first, he was unable to
tell what it was. But after digging for a while longer, he was able
to identify it.</p>
<p>It was a big carrot. The skin was purple, and the root was two
feet long. There was also a purple beard on it.</p>
<p>Han Sen dug out the giant carrot and gave it to Bao’er. He
curiously asked, “Bao’er, since when have you enjoyed eating
carrots?”</p>
<p>“Dad, even if we were at home, I’m pretty sure this thing would
be called ginseng.” Bao’er held the big carrot as she spoke to Han
Sen.</p>
<p>“Ginseng?” Han Sen was shocked. That thing looked just like a
carrot. How could ginseng be that large? And Han Sen remembered
that ginseng looked yellowish. This thing was purple. It was a
carrot, no matter what.</p>
<p>“Then treat it as a carrot.” As Bao’er fondled the massive
ginseng, she looked very happy. She looked at Han Sen and said,
“Daddy, keep digging. I am sure you can find something else in
there.”</p>
<p>“There is something else?” Han Sen kept on digging.</p>
<p>The cameras only had video. Ice Blue Knight King and the others
of the Extreme King were unable to hear what was being spoken. They
watched as Han Sen dug up a big carrot and gave it to Bao’er to
hold.</p>
<p>King Bai frowned. No one around him recognized what the big
carrot was.</p>
<p>There were too many similar plants in the universe. If they
weren’t famous, there wasn’t much of a chance of people remembering
them. The purple carrot was the same as the mushrooms, in that it
wasn’t famous at all. No one had heard of them before.</p>
<p>Now, they were very curious about what Han Sen could dig out of
the ground there.</p>
<p>Han Sen didn’t know what he was about to dig up, either. He just
used his Ghost Teeth Knife to keep digging. It looked as if there
wasn’t too much to be found. He dug another meter into the ground,
but there didn’t appear to be anything down there below the
earth.</p>
<p>“Bao’er, are you sure there’s something down here?” Han Sen
looked at Bao’er with confusion.</p>
<p>“There should be.” Bao’er was still holding the giant ginseng,
sitting atop a rock.</p>
<p>Han Sen kept on digging. He dug three meters into the ground
before he felt the tip of his knife strike something.</p>
<p>Because the hole was too deep, the camera’s position wasn’t
right, and the Extreme King couldn’t film whatever was inside the
hole.</p>
<p>Ice Blue Knight King and the others of the Extreme King could
only see Bao’er. She was sitting atop the hole with a carrot in her
hand, with rocks and soil being flung out of the hole. But they
couldn’t see what was going on inside the pit.</p>
<p>If they were there, they could use many methods to see what was
in the hole. But through video, no matter how smart they were, they
couldn’t tell what was going on below ground.</p>
<p>Han Sen felt something down there. He dug faster as he grew more
excited. It wasn’t long before he revealed what was down there.</p>
<p>Han Sen discovered that it was a shield. It looked like a tower
shield. It was forged from purple metal, which was almost like some
form of copper, but not quite. If he was honest with himself, he
wasn’t even sure if it was metal.</p>
<p>The inside of the shield was facing up, so Han Sen could see the
handle. The styling of it was so old, and there weren’t even any
insignias on it. Han Sen grabbed the handle of the shield and
lifted it.</p>
<p>“Why is it so heavy? But then again, judging by the weight, it
has to be something good.” The shield was so heavy that Han Sen was
having trouble holding it up. Still, he managed to get it out.</p>
<p>Boom!</p>
<p>He had only just lifted the shield when, before he could see
what was on the front of the shield, a purple light burst from the
shield like a volcano. The light flashed up into the sky.</p>
<p>Han Sen was shocked. He raised his head and looked into the sky.
In that purple light, there was a beautiful woman with a fantastic
body and a snake tail.</p>
