<h3>Chapter 2595</h3>

<p>“Let’s go.” Han Sen returned to the white whale and allowed
Bao’er to fly the white whale away.</p>
<p>He felt terrible. The energy in his body was all gone, and his
flesh was about to collapse. Even his peacock king soul robe had
been drained. If he hadn’t used the super god spirit body to
separate himself from the Shield of the Medusa’s Gaze, he and the
peacock king’s soul robe would have been reduced to ash.</p>
<p>“Too scary,” Han Sen thought, still reeling from what had
happened. The price of using the Shield of the Medusa’s Gaze was
far greater than he could willingly accept.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the eyes of the woman on the Shield of the Medusa’s
Gaze had only opened a little. Who could fathom how much power
would be required to open both of her eyes completely?</p>
<p>Until he became deified, Han Sen was no longer going to use it.
It would kill him.</p>
<p>Fortunately, after what happened, no one bothered to hunt him
down. Aside from a few space xenogeneics, nothing living bothered
him.</p>
<p>It wasn’t like the Extreme King or other races couldn’t find Han
Sen; they simply didn’t dare to.</p>
<p>Meng Lie hung in space like a purple ice sculpture. The people
who wanted to chase Han Sen down witnessed everything, and they
decided that going after Han Sen was no longer worth it. The
Extreme King paid a high price to remove Meng Lie from space.</p>
<p>Han Sen could use the Shield of the Medusa’s Gaze. Every race
thought this was unbelievable. It was a true god weapon, and
ordinary deifieds couldn’t touch it. Han Sen was only a King, yet
he had somehow accessed the weapon’s horrifying power. It made
every race fear him.</p>
<p>Until Han Sen figured out how far he could go with the Shield of
the Medusa’s Gaze, no one dared to trouble him.</p>
<p>If Han Sen was able to activate the entire power contained
within the Shield of the Medusa’s Gaze, no one would be able to
defeat him aside from a true god deified.</p>
<p>Now that no one was interfering with his travel, Han Sen and his
people traveled through the remainder of the systems of chaos in
safety. They reached Sky Palace without further danger.</p>
<p>But Han Sen’s situation wasn’t good. The Shield of the Medusa’s
Gaze had sucked his body dry. After a month, Han Sen had yet to
recover.</p>
<p>The strength of his body had been drastically reduced. His legs
were soft when he walked. It would take him another two or three
years to fully recover.</p>
<p>Fortunately, no one from the outside was aware of what had
happened to him. They were in Sky Palace now, as well, so there was
no need to worry about security. Sky Palace sent a few elders to
welcome Han Sen and Yisha. They weren’t showing such respect
because of Yisha and the Rebate, though; they had come because Han
Sen was a very important individual.</p>
<p>Han Sen was able to bless deifieds. And he owned the Charming
God’s Jian and the Shield of the Medusa’s Gaze. Those things made
Han Sen more valuable to them than the entire race of the Rebate.
It made Sky Palace treat him seriously.</p>
<p>If they knew Han Sen also had the Nine Spin Destiny Mirror and
the Ghana’s race weapon Purgatory Heaven, who knew what they would
think.</p>
<p>Han Sen rested in Sky Palace. Sky Palace sent many powerful
deified elites skilled in healing to treat him, but they didn’t
achieve very good results.</p>
<p>Han Sen wasn’t just injured. He had exhausted his genes, and
recovery wouldn’t come easy.</p>
<p>They were there for a few days when Yisha told Han Sen that Han
Meng’er was there. It made Han Sen very happy.</p>
<p>Han Sen thought that Narrow Moon might have been affected
because of what he had done. It was good that Han Meng’er and the
others were allowed into Sky Palace.</p>
<p>But Han Sen hadn’t seen Han Meng’er and the others just yet.
Yisha smiled and didn’t explain. She invited Han Sen to come with
her.</p>
<p>They left the xenogeneic space of Sky Palace and headed to a
nearby system that was also owned by Sky Palace. Sky Palace owned
many systems, and this was an important one within their
domain.</p>
<p>As Han Sen flew alongside Yisha, he noticed that his
surroundings weren’t as he remembered. There used to be many stars
in this area of space, but now, it was empty. There wasn’t even an
asteroid.</p>
<p>“Did a big fight take place here? Did the people of the Extreme
King come?” Han Sen asked Yisha with confusion.</p>
<p>Yisha laughed and didn’t say a word. She looked out across
space.</p>
<p>Han Sen followed her gaze. There, he saw many stars. It was
nothing special.</p>
<p>But soon after, Han Sen heard the sound of thunder echo through
space. Even the vacuum couldn’t stop that sound from being
transmitted.</p>
<p>Han Sen looked in the direction that the sound had come from,
and then, his mouth dropped open in shock. He couldn’t believe his
eyes. He was looking at Narrow Moon.</p>
<p>All the planets of Narrow Moon moving toward him, heading for
the empty section of space that he and Yisha hovered in. The scene
was extremely shocking.</p>
<p>A scary elite of Sky Palace was behind the star. He had a whip.
Every time he swung the whip, the crack of thunder sounded.</p>
<p>The cluster of stars were like many fat sheep. They were slowly
being pushed forward. The very large Narrow Moon was being whipped
forward into this place.“This… this can actually happen…” Han Sen
had no idea how to process what he was seeing. He never dreamed of
something like this being possible. Yisha smiled and said, “If I
wasn’t prepared, I would never have allowed the people of the
Rebate to be put at risk. This is a deified weapon of Sky Palace.
It is the Chase Star Whip, and it can make stars listen to its
commands. I invited Sky Palace’s leader to help me move Narrow Moon
to this area. That is why we have allied with Sky Palace.”</p>
<p>Han Sen watched the whole of Narrow Moon be moved into an empty
region of space. He assumed that the old system must have been
moved elsewhere, to keep that region open for Narrow Moon.</p>
<p>After Narrow Moon came to rest in its new home, Yisha took Han
Sen over to thank the Sky Palace elder. The elder smiled and said,
“This is only me doing what I should. There is no need to thank
me.”</p>
<p>The elder took the Chase Star Whip with him when he left. Han
Sen couldn’t wait to enter Narrow Moon. He flew straight to Planet
Eclipse and saw Han Meng’er. He was so happy.</p>
<p>The Rebate were talking about the deal that allowed them to join
up with Sky Palace, but the part that included Han Sen was still
something that had to be discussed.</p>
<p>Because Han Sen was worth more than the whole of the Rebate,
Yisha only negotiated terms for the Rebate themselves. She didn’t
include Han Sen in the discussions.</p>
<p>Sky Palace had come up with many plans, but Han Sen decided to
join Sky Palace as a member of the Rebate. He didn’t join Sky
Palace as just himself.</p>
<p>By doing that, he lost many of the benefits he could have
earned. But Yisha had risked so much in the systems of chaos to
save him. She moved the whole of the Rebate because of it, and she
had made enemies of the Extreme King in the process. That was a big
favor. Han Sen couldn’t abandon the Rebate and join Sky Palace
alone.</p>
