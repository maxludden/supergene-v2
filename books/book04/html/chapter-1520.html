    <p>“Oh no!” Spirit Twelve and Spirit Thirteen felt a chill.</p>
    <p>
      Han Sen led the army of ants into the shelter, and the red-eyed ants
      skittered everywhere once inside. They couldn’t catch Han Sen, so they
      merely dined on whatever other creatures happened to be in their way. Even
      the buildings and constructs were broken in their rampage.
    </p>
    <p>
      The ants were like an overflowing river, swamping the entire shelter. In
      moments, the ground was like a blood-red sea.
    </p>
    <p>
      “I am going to kill you!” Spirit Twelve saw the creatures in his shelter
      getting eaten by the ants. They had been difficult to tame, and he
      clenched his jaw harder and harder.
    </p>
    <p>
      Spirit Thirteen kept a hand on Spirit Twelve, prohibiting him from rushing
      in to attack Han Sen.
    </p>
    <p>
      The raging ants were everywhere, and the ant king was there, as well. It
      was too dangerous to go.
    </p>
    <p>
      Spirit Thirteen was glad that their Dark Spirit spirit stones were in Dark
      Spirit Shelter, that much was certain. They would probably have been
      killed, with all the ants that had now taken over their shelter.
    </p>
    <p>
      Han Sen raced into the spirit hall and grabbed the spirit stone embedded
      in the statue. But the spirit stone did not belong to Spirit Thirteen, and
      he found that it simply belonged to a royal spirit. This disappointed him.
    </p>
    <p>
      The royal spirit wasn’t willing to pledge allegiance to Han Sen, and it
      self-destructed. Han Sen thought the spirit might have had a connection to
      Spirit Twelve.
    </p>
    <p>
      The shelter, by this point, had been turned upside down. Han Sen led the
      crowd of ants outside, leaving behind a shelter that was now little more
      than rubble.
    </p>
    <p>“I’m going to kill you!” Han Sen heard someone shouting from behind.</p>
    <p>
      Han Sen cared little for the voice, though, and he just continued running
      with the ants.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Han Sen, what do we do? The ants won’t stop chasing us.” Wang Yuhang
      sounded worried.
    </p>
    <p>
      “We’ll kill the ant king and everything will work out,” Han Sen said, as
      he continued running.
    </p>
    <p>
      “How? Are you able to kill it? It looks like a super demigod to me,” Wang
      Yuhang said.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Well, we can give it a try,” Han Sen said, then drilled into another
      passageway.
    </p>
    <p>
      The passageway was only one-person tall, and when Han Sen went in, the ant
      king followed. It broke many rocks to get through.
    </p>
    <p>
      Han Sen saw this as his opportunity. He was going to combine Taia with the
      red light from his God geno core. Swiftly, he stepped towards the ant’s
      eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      The ant king’s eyes were suddenly turned into gaping holes. The creature
      was instantly stunned with pain, and it reeled back with a sudden desire
      to flee the cave.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Little Uncle, draw it back over here. Don’t let it run off!” Han Sen
      quickly called.
    </p>
    <p>
      “I’m not attracting that thing!” Wang Yuhang shouted, but ultimately he
      couldn’t help himself. He yelled at the ant king, “Dumb ant! I thought you
      wanted me. Come and get me!”
    </p>
    <p>
      The ant king had wanted to fall back, but it abandoned that desire when it
      heard Wang Yuhang’s voice. With a murderous look, the ant king tried to
      rush back in. It kept digging its way through in a bid to reach Wang
      Yuhang and kill him.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Good job, Little Uncle! Continue seducing it,” Han Sen said, stepping
      back deeper into the cave.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Could you use a different f*cking word?” Wang Yuhang shouted, as he
      continued attracting the ant king.
    </p>
    <p>
      Han Sen kept running, too, but said, “You prefer luring? But that’s not
      quite right. You really are more like a pimp.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Shit! You are not educated. This is called sacrifice,” Wang Yuhang said,
      biting his lips.
    </p>
    <p>“Yeah, sure. Sacrifice.” Han Sen just nodded.</p>
    <p>
      Wang Yuhang sounded mad, and he retorted, “Just stop talking crap you
      idiot!”
    </p>
    <p>Han Sen stopped talking and spent more effort on running.</p>
    <p>
      Han Sen kept thrusting Taia into the ant king that was nipping at his
      heels. The ant king’s fitness wasn’t bad, and while Han Sen could damage
      the fiend, he found himself unable to kill it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Every time the ant king was injured, it wanted to catch them even more.
      Wang Yuhang’s presence maintained its aggro.
    </p>
    <p>
      Its steel-like body pursued them, and Han Sen stabbed it in the head many
      times. It continued to bleed profusely, and after an hour, it began to
      look weak.
    </p>
    <p>
      It took half a day for Han Sen to finally plunge his weapon through the
      ant king’s head. The ant king crumpled to the ground and twitched for a
      while before it stopped moving.
    </p>
    <p>
      The ant king’s face was full of holes, showing how many times Han Sen had
      stabbed it. It looked really bad.
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        “Super Creature Bloodthirsty Ant King Killed. Beast Soul Gained. Geno
        Core Unobtained. Flesh Inedible. Consume the Life Geno Essence to Gain
        Zero to Ten Super Geno Points.”
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      When Han Sen heard the kill announcement, he felt as satisfied as he did
      when he ate a lifefruit. “Hunting creatures is better. Those geno plant
      fruits are useless.”
    </p>
    <p>
      Han Sen had a higher chance of obtaining a beast soul by killing
      creatures, and now that he had gotten another super beast soul, he was
      incredibly happy.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then Han Sen felt angry again when his mind returned to opening geno
      fruit.
    </p>
    <p>
      The ant king’s body began to fade away, leaving behind a crystal that was
      the shape of a mini ant king. Han Sen picked it up.
    </p>
    <p>
      The crowd of ants, seeing the dead ant king, dispersed and ran off. They
      all gave up their pursuit.
    </p>
    <p>
      Wang Yuhang wished to shout, but Han Sen held his mouth shut and said,
      “Don’t! There are too many of them. God knows how long it might take us to
      kill them. Getting the ant king was enough.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Yes, but by killing the ant king, only you were able to get a Life Geno
      Essence. I didn’t get anything. Kill some sacred-blood ants for me.” Wang
      Yuhang thought it had been unfair.
    </p>
    <p>
      “There are loads of opportunities to kill sacred-blood creatures, so
      there’s no reason for us to attract so many ants at once. And as for this
      Life Geno Essence, half of it can be yours. If you want, I can give it to
      you.” Han Sen then put down the Life Geno Essence delicately.
    </p>
    <p>
      Han Sen had other Life Geno Essences, but he had thus far been unable to
      absorb them. If Wang Yuhang was able to figure out a way in which it might
      be absorbed, there would be no harm.
    </p>
    <p>
      Since Han Sen was able to kill super creatures now, he didn’t mind giving
      up one Life Geno Essence. He had also managed to get the beast soul, after
      all.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Really?” Wang Yuhang looked at him in disbelief. To him, Han Sen had
      never been that generous.
    </p>
    <p>
      “What do you mean by that? Just take it.” Han Sen threw the Life Geno
      Essence at Wang Yuhang.
    </p>
    <p>
      Wang Yuhang was delighted. He held the Life Geno Essence like a son and
      said, “Yeehee! Thank you so much! Next time we kill a super creature, the
      Life Geno Essence will be yours.”
    </p>
    <p>
      Han Sen wished to say something, but suddenly, a strange sound was heard.
      When he turned around, his face changed.
