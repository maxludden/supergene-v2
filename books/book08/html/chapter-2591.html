<h2>Bad Fight</h2>
<h3>Chapter 2591</h3>

<p>The sky was full of fire, and it was all headed for Meng Lie.
Meng Lie swung his knife, and the sea of fire parted like it had
been cut with a pair of scissors. The fire fell away to either side
of the man and faded.</p>
<p>A cold, golden knife light suddenly flew toward the little red
bird. If the little red bird hadn’t dodged the attack in time, it
would have been cut in half.</p>
<p>“Meng Lie is so powerful! His gold soldier body is very strong.”
Han Sen couldn’t help but compliment his opponent.</p>
<p>Meng Lie was a transmutation deified, and when he turned another
deified xenogeneic into a soldier, his strength had grown. A
primitive deified would have a hard time taking him down.</p>
<p>Han Sen’s body shone with rainbow light. Between his fingers, he
held an arrow that was infused with rainbow light. He pulled back
the string of the Six Core Snake Bow and fired the arrow at Meng
Lie.</p>
<p>The moment the rainbow light arrow left Han Sen’s fingers, it
disappeared. When it appeared again, Meng Lie’s golden lion head
knife hit the arrow of rainbow light. It broke the light arrow with
ease, which shocked Han Sen.</p>
<p>Meng Lie had somehow seen the arrow as it teleported. He had
broken the arrow easily. A power like that was terrifying.</p>
<p>“Transmutation class powers are that scary? Then how strong must
a true god be?” Han Sen sighed. Meng Lie came slashing at Han Sen
like a golden god spirit that was dominating the whole sky.</p>
<p>That knife consumed all of space. It made Han Sen feel as if he
couldn’t dodge.</p>
<p>If Han Sen practiced the real God’s Wander, he could teleport
anywhere he wished to. He could have teleported far away from that
golden knife light. But with his current skills, such techniques
were beyond him.</p>
<p>His eyes were like lightning as he pulled out his purple copper
jian. He used a stance that would allow him to blow up the sky.</p>
<p>Pang!</p>
<p>A knife silk was broken by the scary golden god light. Han Sen
and the purple copper jian flew away. The purple copper jian shook
violently, and Han Sen’s arms were almost cut off. The muscles in
his hands were delivered a deep laceration, and his bones could be
seen through the wound.</p>
<p>“Huh? You blocked my knife and didn’t shatter. That is quite a
good deified weapon. How many deified weapons do you possess?” Meng
Lie looked at the purple copper jian in Han Sen’s hand with
complete surprise.</p>
<p>Han Sen didn’t answer him. He frowned and looked at the purple
copper jian. “Does this guy’s power only work against enemies in
the Black Hole Spider’s stomach?”</p>
<p>The purple copper jian was a race weapon. It was as good as a
weapon of the true god rank, but now, the purple copper jian seemed
a little underwhelming.</p>
<p>Han Sen expected this, though. He hadn’t yet figured out what
sort of power the purple copper jian possessed, so its real power
hadn’t yet been displayed.</p>
<p>In addition, Han Sen’s power was simply too weak. He couldn’t
use the jian’s full power to block Ming Lie’s strike, and it didn’t
even look like the Fourth Uncle had been trying all that hard.</p>
<p>“Han Sen, you should know that my first strike was just me going
easy on you. If you still don’t understand, then the next attack
won’t be so gentle,” Meng Lie said, word by word, as he approached
Han Sen.</p>
<p>Everything that existed trembled under the booming of his voice.
Even Han Sen’s body shook a little.</p>
<p>Han Sen wasn’t shaking because he was afraid, though. It was his
natural reaction to facing a strong enemy. He was so hyped in the
middle of combat that it released all of his hidden power, building
more and more energy within him.</p>
<p>This was the biggest fight he’d had in years, and his only
choice was to win. Losing wasn’t an option. If he lost, then all
the people following him would be killed, too.</p>
<p>Han Sen looked at Meng Lie who had come forward like a god. His
Purple-Eye Butterfly spun like mad. Before Meng Lie attacked again,
Glasses was bringing up the man’s test results.</p>
<p>Target: Extreme King male. Gene Age Calculation: 12,300
years</p>
<p>Gene Level: Transmutation deified</p>
<p>Gene Potential: 8 stars</p>
<p>Han Sen was shocked. It seemed as if the gene potential level
was trickier than he had expected. Even an Extreme King
transmutation deified only had eight stars. The stars of a lower
race were bound to be lower. So, Yisha’s eight stars were actually
quite impressive.</p>
<p>Right now, though, Han Sen didn’t care how many stars Meng Lie
had. The man’s potential wasn’t something that mattered right now.
At the moment, Meng Lie was simply a transmutation deified enemy
that he had to get rid of.</p>
<p>Target: Lion male. Gene Age Calculation: 163,000 years</p>
<p>Gene Level: Primitive deified</p>
<p>Gene Potential: 6 stars</p>
<p>This was the data of the deified xenogeneic that had been turned
into a knife that resembled the head of a gold lion. Its data
didn’t mean anything, though. Under the influence of Meng Lie’s
gold soldier body, the xenogeneic had been transformed into a knife
and gained more power than ever before.</p>
<p>Bzzt!</p>
<p>Another strike was on its way. The gold sword light tore through
the universe, effortlessly cutting through the fabric of space. Han
Sen’s eyes flashed red, and his whole body turned red as well. The
moment the golden knife light landed, it disappeared.</p>
<p>Meng Lie frowned. He didn’t look around, though. He knew exactly
where Han Sen was. He used his left hand to gouge his own eye.</p>
<p>Pang!</p>
<p>Meng Lie’s eye exploded. It was a self-inflicted blow, and a
stream of golden, god-like blood gushed out. Han Sen fell out with
it.</p>
<p>Han Sen had made use of his Blood Eye Evil God’s power to fire
himself into Meng Lie’s eye. He hadn’t realized that Meng Lie would
be so brutally efficient. He was happy to poke and obliterate his
eye, which sent Han Sen rolling out.</p>
<p>“Han Sen, spare me these tricks. They won’t work on the likes of
me.” Meng Lie’s eye was still bleeding golden blood, but the flow
of blood had been reduced dramatically. The wound wasn’t healed,
however, which prevented Han Sen from re-entering the eye with his
Blood Eye Evil God.</p>
<p>He had been blinded, but Meng Lie was still able to watch Han
Sen. It was like he could see every move that Han Sen made.</p>
<p>He moved the gold lion head knife, and the gold knife light that
could destroy the most ancient things surged toward Han Sen. It was
so suppressive. It was like the whole galaxy was going to snap.</p>
<p>The peacock king robe had its wings open. A rainbow substance
chain surrounded Han Sen. It connected with the purple copper jian,
which Han Sen then used as an arrow with the Six Core Snake
Bow.</p>
<p>Facing this scary gold knife light, Han Sen pulled back the
string of the Six Core Snake Bow. He fired the purple copper
jian.</p>
<p>The purple copper jian disappeared in a hazy rainbow light. When
it reappeared, it slammed into the scary gold knife light.</p>
<p>Han Sen wasn’t worried about the purple copper jian breaking.
Race weapons weren’t that easy to break, after all. And even if it
did break, Han Sen wouldn’t be very upset about that. He didn’t
want his new ears or tail anyway.</p>
<p>Pang!</p>
<p>The purple copper jian and the gold god light collided. It was
like a sun had just exploded. It created a scary shockwave that
destroyed everything around them.</p>
<p>Han Sen watched that grand explosion. The purple copper jian
came back, spinning like a flaming wheel. Han Sen grabbed it, and
he marveled at how there wasn’t a single scratch on it.</p>
<p>Meng Lie stared at the purple copper jian, his eyes blank with
shock. He had used so much power that time, but even so, that</p>
<p>oring-looking purple copper jian had blown up his knife light
without incurring any damage. That was unbelievable.</p>
<p>“Is this another deified weapon like the Shield of the Medusa’s
Gaze?” Meng Lie looked at Han Sen’s purple copper jian.</p>
<p>Han Sen looked at his mint condition purple copper jian with
joy. “I don’t know what the true power of the purple copper jian
is, but it seems pretty good. It can block Meng Lie’s knife
lights.”</p>
<p>As Han Sen thought this, he put the purple copper jian back
against the string of the Six Core Snake Bow and aimed at Meng
Lie.</p>
