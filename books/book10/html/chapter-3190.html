<p>Han Sen and Bao’er went to the Feng family castle. The dragon maid followed them from behind. She knew she would be unable to fight them, but her resolve had not been completely dissolved.</p>

<p>Han Sen was a bit worried. Instead of chasing the dragon maid away, he had allowed her to come back to the Feng family castle.</p>

<p>He took the Rocky Dee paper man from Bao’er and went into the garden.</p>

<p>“Rocky Dee, I have things I would like to tell you.” Han Sen put Rocky Dee on a stone table. He glanced at the dragon maid, who was staring at them intently.</p>

<p>Rocky Dee moved his paper body. He was feeling a bit uncomfortable, but he still told the dragon maid, “You can wait outside the garden.”</p>

<p>The dragon maid adhered to the command and waited outside the garden. Even from there, she still watched.</p>

<p>After the dragon maid left, Han Sen spoke to Rocky Dee. “Rocky Dee, you seem to know something. Why don’t you spill the beans?”</p>

<p>Rocky Dee patted himself on the chest and coldly replied, “What makes you think you have what it takes to talk to me in such a capacity?”</p>

<p>“I am Bao’er’s father,” Han Sen coldly said.</p>

<p>Rocky Dee immediately jumped and said, “You do not have what it takes. If you dare to say that you are Master Bao’er’s father, I will kill you.”</p>

<p>Han Sen smiled. “You cannot deny I was the one who raised her from a baby.”</p>

<p>Rocky Dee moved his lips, but he did not say anything.</p>

<p>“If you are not willing to say anything more, then how about I guess?” Han Sen asked with a smile. He had experienced far too many problems in his lifetime. He was confused about many things. The more time he had spent guessing, the more experience he had when it came to guessing.</p>

<p>Upon seeing Rocky Dee not speak, Han Sen started to talk to himself. “You call her Master Bao’er and are so polite to her. That must mean she has a higher position than you. That also means she is stronger than you. People like you would go and fight a God Spirit. At the end of the day, you managed to be stronger and at a higher level than them. So, why would you treat a child like a master? Yet, you are. For that, there can only be one possibility. You and Bao’er have some sort of connection, or perhaps you owe her a favor of some sort.”</p>

<p>“Hmph.” Rocky Dee coldly grunted. He did not actually say anything.</p>

<p>Han Sen laughed and went on to say, “No matter whether or not you owe her a favor or if you two are related, people like you would remember her. You would not forget her. There is no way you did not recognize her in the beginning, yet you did not recognize her in the beginning. It was not until you conducted the test did you change your approach to her. You obviously saw something in the test that enabled you to recognize her.”</p>

<p>Rocky Dee did not say anything. He merely coldly stared at Han Sen.</p>

<p>“I heard Bao’er say that the bronze tripod was a treasure of the God Chaos Party. It is an item that enables a member to test their blood, and there is only one such tool in existence.” Han Sen looked at Rocky Dee and said, “But this bronze tripod is only able to test blood. It cannot determine one’s past life. If it was like that, it would not be a reincarnation. You only saw Bao’er in this life, and you only recognized who she was in this life.”</p>

<p>“Why did you not recognize her in the beginning? You only recognized her after seeing Bao’er’s Blood-Pulse light shadow.” Han Sen squinted and peered at Rocky Dee. He then asked, “Do I need to keep talking?”</p>

<p>“I do not know what you are talking about,” Rocky Dee coldly replied.</p>

<p>Han Sen looked at Rocky Dee and said, “Bao’er is in danger. She is in big danger. Am I correct?”</p>

<p>“Yes. If I were you, I would let her go. Let me and Bao’er leave this place.” Rocky Dee spoke the words in an ordinary tone of voice.</p>

<p>“I believe what you say is true. If I do not let Bao’er leave and do not want you to return to your former self, what do you expect will happen? I think the God Chaos Party will not let you, Mister Minister, simply vanish and disappear from the world.”</p>

<p>Rocky Dee’s heart jumped. Before he spoke again, Han Sen said, “I and Bao’er are like father and daughter. It does not matter whether you accept that fact or not. I will not allow her to leave my side. I do not think Bao’er will want to leave my side either. You do not have the power to change that. So, if you really are standing on Bao’er’s side, I think there is a thing or two you can tell me.”</p>

<p>This time, Rocky Dee did not deny things. He remained silent but did not speak. His eyes lingered on Han Sen. After a while, he said, “You need to know that if Master Bao’er’s identity is revealed, there will be a disaster that while shake the sky. I cannot hold it, and you cannot hold it.”</p>

<p>“You should really tell me who she is,” Han Sens said. “That is the only way we can be prepared, right?”</p>

<p>Rocky Dee shook his head. “I cannot tell you her name, and I cannot disclose her history. If I tell you these things, the universe will be thrown upside down.”</p>

<p>“That seems really serious!” Han Sen looked at Rocky Dee and asked, “There has to be something you can tell me, right?”</p>

<p>Rocky Dee hesitated and said, “Hide her. Do not let the God Spirits realize who she really is. Do not let the God Chaos Party find her, or there will be a grand disaster.”</p>

<p>“I cannot put her in hiding forever,” Han Sen coldly said. “Bao’er will not agree with that. Even if she did agree with it, I would not accept that.”</p>

<p>“At least not now,” Rock Dee said. “You need to wait until she grows up. Maybe then she can.”</p>

<p>“How far must she develop? Must she become Reboot class?” Han Sen asked as a test.</p>

<p>“I do not know,” Rocky Dee said. He looked weird as he spoke. “Master Bao’er’s limit is not something we can guess or even try to understand.”</p>

<p>Han Sen stared at Rocky Dee and said, “Fine. This is the last question. Aside from you, are there any other creatures that can reveal Bao’er’s identity?”</p>

<p>“Yes, or maybe there are none,” Rocky Dee weirdly said.</p>

<p>“Be clearer!” Han Sen frowned.</p>

<p>Rocky Dee sighed and said, “Back in the day, perhaps some people might have been able to tell. These days, I cannot even be sure if those guys are alive. Even if they were, I cannot be certain they would notice. If Master Bao’er did a test like the bronze tripod again, people might recognize something.”</p>

<p>“According to your theory, Bao’er is safe.” Han Sen felt a bit relieved.</p>

<p>“If I was unable to recognize who she was in the first place, I doubt there are many in this world that can do what I could not,” Rocky Dee said with seriousness. “Still, it would be best for her not to be flaunted around, just in case.”</p>

<p>“I understand,” Han Sen said. “You should go. The restrictions on your body can now be removed. I don’t think you need Bao’er to undo the spell put on you.”</p>

<p>“Are you really letting me go?” Rocky Dee looked shocked.</p>

<p>“Keeping you here is sure to attract more trouble,” Han Sen casually said. “I do not want to kill you, therefore I will just choose to let you go.”</p>

<p>“Are you not afraid that I will leak the secrets about Master Bao’er?” Rocky Dee asked.</p>

<p>“I am afraid, but I do not think you will. After Bao’er left, you could have run, but you didn’t.” Han Sen smiled.</p>

<p>“Hmph.” Rocky Dee coldly grunted. He twisted the paper and jumped. In the air, he became his real self again. He reached out the paper man in his hand to Han Sen. “Give this paper man to Master Bao’er. If she needs it, she only has to use the paper man, and I will lend her my assistance.”</p>

<p>After that, Rocky Dee threw the paper man at Han Sen like a card. He turned around and left the garden, taking the dragon maid with him.</p>
