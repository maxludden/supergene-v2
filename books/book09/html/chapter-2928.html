<p>Nine Thousand King laughed and let go of Qige. He let him land
next to his feet. He touched his face and laughed. “Good! You are a
good boy.”</p>
<p>Qige quickly said, “To have a powerful father like you, I must
have fulfilled a few lifetimes of good deeds to be rewarded so
handsomely. I don’t just have to be your child either. I can be
your cow. I can be your horse. I can be your servant and slave. It
would be my pleasure. I never dreamed of being able to have such an
amazing, invincible father like you before.”</p>
<p>Han Sen and the Extreme King could not watch this anymore. After
all, this was a child of the 10 generals. They did not expect him
to behave like this.</p>
<p>When Nine Thousand King heard what was said, he smiled. He
squinted his eyes and placed his hand on Qige’s head. He looked at
Moon Shadow God with a cocky expression. “Moon Shadow, now that
your son has agreed, you should be fine with this too.”</p>
<p>Moon Shadow God was furious. She also knew that regardless of
how much Qige begged, if she did not agree, Nine Thousand King
would crush Qige’s head.</p>
<p>No matter how much she did not want to, Qige was still her son.
She didn’t have an option to say no. She did not want to see her
son die in front of her.</p>
<p>While Nine Thousand King, Moon Shadow God, and her son were
entangled with their own matters, Han Sen went over to Ancient
Abyss Grandmaster and asked, “Who is this Nine Thousand King? I
have never heard of someone like that in Sacred before.”</p>
<p>Ancient Abyss Grandmaster did not immediately say anything. A
voice soon sounded in Han Sen’s ear. “Although Nine Thousand King
was not one of the top 10 generals, he was an officer of Sacred.
Although he was not as famous as the 10 generals, he is not someone
ordinary. After Sacred was destroyed, people assumed he was dead. I
did not expect to find him alive. While the big barren power was
the weakest, he came to the Sacred ruins. It looks like he wants
that thing from Sacred.”</p>
<p>Han Sen nodded. He knew many scary people were going to the
ruins, so this could not have been a coincidence.</p>
<p>Han Sen did not say anything. Besides, he did not know much
about the topic. It was just a coincidence that he was there. The
more he spoke, the more wrong he was. He preferred not to say
anything.</p>
<p>“Moon Shadow, have you thought about it? There is not much time,
so stop delaying your son’s business.” Nine Thousand King looked
evil as he patted Qige on the head.</p>
<p>Moon Shadow God replied, “Nine Thousand King, let go of my son.
If you do, I will let you do anything.” Although she really wanted
to kill him, she had to think about her son with Evil Sky Dog. He
was the only connection they had now, and she did not want to see
it severed.</p>
<p>“Ha! Ha!” Nine Thousand Kind looked at the sky and laughed.
“Moon Shadow, do not worry. Why would I do anything bad to our son?
He is such a good son. I will be happy to accept him. I will reward
him and not hurt him.”</p>
<p>Qige was very happy. He kowtowed as he shared his gratitude.
“Thanks, Dad.”</p>
<p>Nine Thousand King was still acting cocky. He patted Qige on the
head and smiled. “Good, son! Very good, son! I really should reward
you.”</p>
<p>Qige rolled his eyes. He stared at Han Sen and said, “To be your
son is the greatest reward. I would not dare try and take your
rewards, but that crystallizer slave dared to disrespect you. He
deserves to die. I am not strong enough to fight him. Otherwise, I
would skin him alive in the name of avenging you. As for the Dog
Crow Bow, I want to retrieve it so I can give it to you. It will be
a gift for the gratitude I feel for you.”</p>
<p>Han Sen looked at Ancient Abyss Grandmaster. They thought that
guy was the ultimate rare thing. He was like an extreme animal.
Even now, he still wanted to bite Han Sen.</p>
<p>“Good, son, that is not so hard.” Nine Thousand King looked at
Han Sen and quietly asked, “Did you hear him? Give the Dog Crow Bow
back to my son.”</p>
<p>Qige shouted, “Dad, stop talking crap with him. Just kill
him!”</p>
<p>Han Sen looked at Qige. He raised the Dog Crow Bow again and
coldly said, “I said the life of my prey is decided by me.”</p>
<p>The bow was being pointed at Qige. He was shocked, but he saw
that Nine Thousand King was right next to him. He had the courage
again to mock Han Sen. “How dare you to misbehave before my father.
You have a death wish!”</p>
<p>Han Sen ignored him. He thought Qige was a mad dog and stupid.
Nine Thousand King must have been worried about something.
Otherwise, he would have already attacked. There should have been
no need for simple provocation.</p>
<p>Even Nine Thousand King did not dare do anything. He was a fox
trying to prove that he was a tiger.</p>
<p>Buzz!</p>
<p>Han Sen let an arrow loose. The teeth arrow was gone. It was
clearly going for Qige. Qige’s expression changed, but it quickly
returned to normal. He saw Nine Thousand King raise his hand again.
He thought Nine Thousand King would catch the teeth arrow just like
before.</p>
<p>Suddenly, the teeth arrow pierced through Qige’s head and came
out the other side.</p>
<p>Qige’s eyes were wide open. He could not believe he was about to
die like that.</p>
<p>“Time power!” Nine Thousand King’s expression changed too. His
hand only reached out a short distance, so he was unable to catch
the arrow.</p>
<p>Moon Shadow God looked shocked and very conflicted. She ran to
hold Qige’s dead body. She gnashed her teeth, looked at Han Sen,
and screamed, “I will kill you!”</p>
<p>After that, she turned into a shadow. She blended in with the
darkness and disappeared.</p>
<p>Nine Thousand King steadily stared at Han Sen. His power seemed
red. He was suppressing Han Sen, who was just standing there. He
looked like he was going to kill Han Sen any second, but he had yet
to do anything.</p>
<p>Ancient Abyss Grandmaster asked, “If you guys fight here before
entering Sacred, are you not going to benefit other people?”</p>
<p>“I will let you live a bit longer.” Nine Thousand King coldly
grunted. He turned around and fled through the door. He vanished
into the darkness.</p>
<p>Ancient Abyss Grandmaster turned to Han Sen and said, “Brother
Han, you really should not have killed Qige. Now, we have offended
two scary elites at once.”</p>
<p>“That mad dog was worse than an animal. He bit whoever he saw.
It was better to just kill him.” Han Sen did not care. He planned
on going to Sacred to save Littleflower. Even if Sacred’s 10
generals or four holy beasts were there, they would not stop him.
Besides, Qige was just a dog hybrid with a bark worse than his
bite.</p>
<p>“Right, never mind then. Let’s go to Sacred. Otherwise, they
will have the chance first.” Ancient Abyss Grandmaster paused. He
smiled at Han Sen. “If you do not mind, why don’t you come with me?
Then, we will all have backup.”</p>
<p>“If you don’t mind our presence, of course, we will come.” Han
Sen called Bao’er, who was riding atop the big goldfish. They
followed Ancient Abyss Grandmaster through the door.</p>
<p>As for Qige’s dead body, Han Sen did not bother looking at it.
There was only a killing announcement in his head and no mention of
beast souls. There wasn’t even a xenogeneic gene. Qige was
obviously useless rubbish.</p>
