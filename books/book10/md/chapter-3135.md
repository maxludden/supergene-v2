  When Han Sen and the others reached the next planet in Ghost Starlight, there was a mountain of dead bodies and a sea of blood. The bodies of all kinds of creatures and human elites were on this giant planet. The planet looked like it was full of holes. It almost looked like a beehive. The scarier thing about it was a giant horde of bees in the sky that looked like a cloud. They covered the sky, and they almost covered the entire planet.

Many nobles were far away from this planet. They only watched it. No one dared to approach the planet. “Brother, what’s going on?” Bald Guy asked someone nearby. That person should have been alone. He had an ice-cold personality. When he heard the question, he said, “This planet had countless toxic bees emerge from underground. They killed everything on the planet. Everyone thinks this planet has a land pulse that can shock the sky. After a few powerful people entered, no one has made it out alive. These toxic bees are scary.”

While they were talking, someone called out for Bald Guy. Han Sen looked over and saw it was Bald Guy’s classmates. The person who spoke was an old mister. It should have been Bald Guy’s teacher, Mister Wei.

Mister Wei was sitting atop a Holy Wen White Deer. He asked Bald Guy, “Yu Fei, why are you here now?”

It was the same Holy Wen White Deer as the one Han Sen had, but the one Mister Wei had was better. It was stronger, and its body contained holy text. It was likely in ultimate mode.

“Mister, I have made friends here, so I went with them,” Bald Guy politely answered

Brother Three sarcastically said, “Mister, Brother Xia is famous now. He only makes friends with big characters. Did you not know that? This is Brother Xia’s good friend, loved by the crown prince, the one and only, Han Sen. The man who murdered the general of the royal guards.”

Upon hearing that, Mister Wei frowned.

Han Sen was loved by the crown prince. Because he assassinated Steel Scene, he offended all the nobles. He was the crux of the issues currently plaguing relations between the royals and nobles.

Han Sen was hated throughout the Qin Kingdom.

Mister Wei was one of the nobles. He was born a noble and obeyed the law. He did not really like a reckless person like Han Sen.

“Yu Fei, the land pulse that shocked the world has opened. This place is very dangerous, so I think it would be best if you followed me.” Mister Wei did not want Bald Guy to be good friends with Han Sen. He did not want to see his reputation dragged through the mud by him.

Bald Guy gnashed his teeth and said, “Teacher, I made a promise to do this with my friends. I am not going to break my promise.”

Mister Wei wanted to say something, but Brother Three asked, “Master, do you not understand? Brother Xia only looks for friends in high places. He thinks we are too lowly for him.”

“What nonsense are you talking about?” Bald Guy was angered by the remark.

Brother Three wanted to fight back, but they suddenly heard the sound of a big dragon roaring. It was like a thunderstrike that shocked the whole sky.

Everyone looked in the direction of where that dragon roar had come from. They saw a group of riders riding atop a big dragon. They were coming their way. There were 10,00 of them. They were very powerful. In between the big dragon riders, eight powerful big dragons were pulling a stagecoach. It was beautiful. The carriage looked very elegant. It was an unusual sight.

“Sky King is here,” Brother Three said.

Mister Wei looked at Bald Guy and sighed. “Yu Fei, be wary of the friends you make. If you do not, only harm will come to you.” “Teacher, I understand, but Han Sen really isn’t how you think it is,” Bald Guy attempted to explain.

After hearing Bald Guy insist, Mister Wei shook his head and said nothing else. He led his students toward Sky King.

Ghost Starlight’s planets were too dangerous. Although Mister Wei had some power, he did not have enough power to dig up the scary land pulse. Therefore, he decided to co-operate with Sky King.

Mister Wei led everyone to the carriage. All the students bowed to Sky King.

Sky King was one of the leaders with a different surname in the Qin Kingdom. He was an important person among the nobles. Although Mister Wei was famous, he would not behave superior in front of Sky King.

“Greetings, Mister. Come on in for a meet.” Sky King’s voice came from inside the carriage. Someone opened the door and invited Mister Wei inside.

Mister Wei told his students to follow him in. He entered the carriage. The students behind the carriage were jealous. Brother Three spoke to the brother next to him. “I wonder when I can be as cool as Teacher, sitting in the same carriage with a noble king.”

That brother replied, “You just need to focus on learning from Teacher. When you get to his level, you will be just like him one day.”

“That will not be easy,” Brother Three said with a sigh. “Land pulse skills are very hard to learn. They are not easy to master.”

While they were talking, they soon discovered that the team going to the planet changed direction. It was unclear where they were going. “What is going on? I thought we are digging up a land pulse on the planet. Why are we changing locations?” Many brothers were confused. They had met Sky King there for the sole purpose of digging up a land pulse on the Ghost Starlight planet. Although they had just arrived there, Sky King’s team opted to go somewhere else. It was unknown where they were headed.

Although the people did not have a clue what was happening, they did not have the guts to ask. They just followed the others with confusion.

Not long later, the team went past where Han Sen was. Brother Three looked at Bald Guy cockily. He lifted his lips and looked at him with disdain.

He really hated Bald Guy, but that was mainly because Bald Guy was not a noble from Jade Wall City. He was the son of a city leader. He counted as a noble, but Brother Three was a noble from Jade Wall City. Bald Guy was just someone from an underdeveloped place.

If it was not for his luck, he would not have become Mister Wei’s student.

Brother Three thought, “What an ignorant redneck. He does not even know much. He wants to be friends with Han Sen, who does not know how high the sky is. The crown prince is just the crown prince. No one knows when he will be king. Besides, the crown prince is immature. He might like Han Sen now, but it won’t be long until he is bored of him. One day, with the crown prince not being a king yet, Han Sen will get nothing. If the crown prince forgets about him, he will be nothing. People like Sky King are the most important in the country. Being a mister under Sky King provides the most benefits.”

While he was thinking, the team suddenly stopped.

Brother Three and the others were confused. There was no planet or land pulse. It was unknown why the team was stopping there.

While they were standing there confused, Sky King’s carriage opened. This time, it was Sky King who emerged.
