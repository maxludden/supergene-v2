<p>“Extreme King? One of the top three lanterns in the geno hall? That Extreme King?” When Han Sen heard the name, he was surprised.</p>

<p>He thought Narrow Moon depended on Sky Palace for protection, but hearing her say this, that didn’t seem quite so likely.</p>

<p>Yisha nodded and said, “It was the Extreme King that first landed on Planet Rebate and took us as slaves. Our alpha was raised by a famous member of the Extreme King, and so that is how she garnered so many resources and achieved what she did.”</p>

<p>Han Sen’s face kept changing. Sky Palace, Dragon, and the Destroyed were in the top ten. The Demon and the Buddha were in the top one hundred.</p>

<p>But the truly powerful races were the top three of the geno hall. The top three were stronger than any other race. Not even Sky Palace, in all their might, could challenge them.</p>

<p>In the geno universe, most of everything was split between those top three races. All of the factions were sub-factions of the three of them, in some capacity.</p>

<p>Extreme King was the third, but right now, they were the best-known race in the entire universe.</p>

<p>The first two races were quite mysterious. They were almost never seen, and no one knew where they lived. One of them was a complete loner race that never allied with anyone else and kept to themselves. They never allowed outsiders into their midst, and they never accepted new members. Someone might occasionally be allowed to work with them, but that was exceedingly rare.</p>

<p>Big factions like Sky Palace were connected with the first race. It was called Very High, but Very High was also very mysterious. It was rare to see their people, and very few could actually interact with them.</p>

<p>There were rumors about the Buddha having an association of some kind with the Very High, but so far, that was just a myth. No one knew any of the specifics.</p>

<p>The likes of the Dragon and the Destroyed were more connected to the second race. They were called Ancient God.</p>

<p>Yisha and Sky Palace’s relationship was a close one. Han Sen had thought the Rebate belonged to Sky Palace, so it was odd to find that they were connected to Extreme King.</p>

<p>Yisha nodded and said, “Right now, the Rebate are considered one of the higher races. We have many things, but we still need the support that a race like Extreme King can provide.”</p>

<p>After pausing, Yisha went on to say, “I wanted to tell you this because I need you to know how important resources are.</p>

<p>Especially since you are practicing The Story of Genes. For someone like you, resources are more important than ever.” Thank you for telling me this.” Han Sen gave Yisha a slight bow to show his respect.</p>

<p>He knew Yisha wouldn’t randomly tell him all this. She must have had some plan that involved acquiring resources. Otherwise, she wouldn’t have come here. It wasn’t as if he needed any bedtime stories, after all.</p>

<p>“In about a month, I will be going to the Extreme King,” Yisha coldly said.</p>

<p>Han Sen was shocked. “Seriously? When will you get back?”</p>

<p>Yisha did not answer. She just looked over the glittering surface of Mirror Lake and said, “Everything I have achieved will be for naught if I do not become deified. If I don’t ascend, it won’t matter if I come back at all. I’ll be there for as long as it takes, and I will do whatever I can. As long as the road remains open for you, you may continue on your way.”</p>

<p>After that, Yisha turned around and left. She ignored Han Sen, and after taking a few steps, she disappeared from Planet Eclipse.</p>

<p>Han Sen frowned. Yisha hadn’t actually told him all that much, but Han Sen got the gist of what she meant.</p>

<p>Her trip would be very dangerous, and there was every chance she could die whilst on the way. It was a risk she would take for the chance to become deified.</p>

<p>Yisha’s presence had made Han Sen feel very secure during his stay in Narrow Moon. While she was around, nobody would dare to lay a finger on him. The stuff that belonged to him, remained with him. And he frequently had the opportunity to take the things of others.</p>

<p>But it was difficult to determine how things would go for him with Yisha being absent. If Yisha achieved the breakthrough she needed with the Extreme King, that would be wonderful. If she couldn’t, and the news found Han Sen, things would take a turn for the worse with him, as well.</p>

<p>Yisha had come to Planet Eclipse to tell him all this because there was a choice he would have to make. He needed to let go. If he didn’t, he’d die.</p>

<p>“You need to lose something to gain something. That is what she meant. Is she leaving me with everything of hers in Narrow Moon?” Han Sen was suddenly overjoyed.</p>

<p>With Yisha’s reputation, she was sure to have an abundance of wealth in Narrow Moon. If he was able to take over all of her things, leveling up to King would not be all that difficult.</p>

<p>But Han Sen was Yisha’s student. According to the rules of the Rebate, he wasn’t qualified to take over her legacy and wealth. And most of Yisha’s resources belonged to the Rebate. If she died, those resources would be taken back by the Rebate and redistributed. Not many things there actually belonged to her. He might have been the next best thing to an heir that she had, but that would matter little.</p>

<p>Han Sen didn’t even know if he could take control of her personal resources. After all, if she died, the Rebate would not want her legacy to fall into the hands of an outsider.</p>

<p>Things were never that simple, of course. And before Yisha went to the Extreme King, she established plans for Narrow Moon in her absence. But Han Sen was not given any of her resources, so he had little say in what happened to them.</p>

<p>It wasn’t as if Yisha left him with nothing, however. What Yisha had given him actually left Han Sen somewhat confused.</p>

<p>“Cold Palace Guardian…” Han Sen mumbled, staring at the white jade tablet in his hands, and he looked confused.</p>

<p>The white jade tablet was about the size of a man’s hand, and it seemed to have been sculpted from ice. The words “Cold Palace Guardian” were written across it in red letters.</p>

<p>Han Sen knew it had to be an identity card of sorts. Yisha had also left him a note explaining the item; it was something he would need to access someplace called Cold Palace.</p>

<p>“Cold Palace… Is that a place for used boytoys?” Han Sen considered that possibility, while his mind brought up images of men dressed in skimpy clothes with faces full of makeup. He thought of them sitting around the house, wiping away their tears. Han Sen started to feel uncomfortable.</p>

<p>“Ahem… That cannot be it, surely. I have never heard of Yisha playing with men before. I will have to go and take a look at Cold Palace for myself.” Han Sen shook his head, trying to shake off the strange scenes he had just envisioned.</p>

<p>Cold Palace was on Yisha’s planet, so Han Sen packed up his things and went to Planet Blade.</p>

<p>Han Sen would have liked to bring Bao’er, but Yisha’s note stated that only the person holding the tablet would be permitted access. Any other creature would be killed on sight.</p>

<p>That made Han Sen very curious about what Cold Palace actually was. Why would Yisha want him to become a Cold Palace Guardian?</p>
