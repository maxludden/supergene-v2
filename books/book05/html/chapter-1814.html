<p>Han Sen ran forward and looked back. There was nothing behind
him.</p>
<p>When he looked at his shoulder, he saw nothing there. He felt as
if something was sitting there, but he just couldn’t see it.</p>
<p>Suddenly, the colors on Han Sen’s shoulder became blurry. He saw
that a creature, like a chameleon, had just appeared.</p>
<p>And then, the colors began to shift again. The creature was
blending back into its environment. Even at such a close distance,
Han Sen couldn’t see it anymore.</p>
<p>“Surely it can’t have come out of that weird ball,” Han Sen
thought.</p>
<p>Although the little creature had only just appeared, it looked
like a straight-up monster. It was simply small, that was all. It
was around the size of a man’s hand. And now, Han Sen had an answer
for why the ball was no longer in the pool. The creature could
change color to avoid being seen.</p>
<p>The little thing’s color changed again. It went to his right
shoulder, changed color, and disappeared again.</p>
<p>“That is so powerful. It is practically invisible,” Han Sen
thought, as he watched the little thing change its colors. It was
so close to him, and yet, Han Sen could not see it at all.</p>
<p>“Did you come out of the ball?” Han Sen asked. He wasn’t sure if
the creature could hear him. But it seemed as if it did. It
revealed itself, nodded, and then disappeared again.</p>
<p>Han Sen was no longer worried. It was certainly not a hostile
creature. So, he went ahead and exited the circular chamber. “Oh
no!” Han Sen noticed that both Yisha and Hawk Wing, whom he had
knocked out, were gone.</p>
<p>The cocoon had apparently risen into the air again, and there
were many paths to the outside available. The whole cocoon was
glowing.</p>
<p>Han Sen would have liked to leave the same way he had entered,
but the white liquid under the bridge had started to rage. It was
like a fountain, hosing the entirety of the cocoon.</p>
<p>A hole appeared in the top of the cocoon, and a white pillar
suddenly descended through it. It caught Han Sen’s body and pushed
him back through the air, heading downwards out of the cocoon.</p>
<p>When he exited, the group of monsters came running towards Han
Sen. They surrounded him. The little monster walked directly before
Han Sen and looked at him.</p>
<p>The little thing on Han Sen’s shoulder revealed itself before
jumping into the little monster’s hands. The little monster was so
happy as it held the little creature up to the sky. It roared.</p>
<p>The group of monsters also roared alongside him. It was like a
cult, all singing praise.</p>
<p>Not long after, the noise quietened and silence returned. The
little monster commanded another monster to collect Han Sen. Han
Sen understood how they worked now, so he decided to hop on top of
the monster.</p>
<p>He had realized by now that he wouldn’t be able to find Yisha
and Hawk Wing.</p>
<p>Han Sen was glad that he had managed to loot Hawk Wing’s body
while he was unconscious, though. He hadn’t lost too much when Hawk
Wing had run off. But Han Sen did not know if the items he had
retrieved were worth it. He’d inspect them all and come to a
conclusion later.</p>
<p>The monster started walking back, but they weren’t sending Han
Sen to the Chaos. They actually went deeper into the desert.</p>
<p>“Hey, where are you taking me?” Han Sen’s heart sank. All he
wanted to do right about now was leave. The possibility of Yisha
finding him outside of Demon Grave was no laughing matter.</p>
<p>The monsters ignored his question. They ran for a whole day
through the desert until they reached an oasis.</p>
<p>The oasis was even bigger than the one where the Chaos lived.
The fruit there were in abundance, and every vine held clusters of
the fruit</p>
<p>The monster put him down, and then the little monster pointed at
the fruit and pointed at Han Sen.</p>
<p>“Are you saying these fruits are mine, and I can take whatever I
want?” Han Sen was so happy.</p>
<p>Han Sen saw a xenogeneic fruit amidst the rest, and he realized
there must have been many of them there. If he could take as much
as he wanted to, he could receive a lot</p>
<p>The little monster nodded, and so Han Sen picked up an apple
that looked like a diamond. He also took a banana that looked like
yellow jade. There was even a ruby dragonfruit.</p>
<p>Seeing Han Sen grab so many in such a short time, the monster
was given a cold sweat. He bit Han Sen by the armor and pulled him
to another area.</p>
<p>“Why are you bringing me to this well? I’m not thirsty. Let me
take some more!” Han Sen was carrying a sack full of xenogeneic
fruit He sounded so greedy.</p>
<p>The little monster’s eyelids twitched, right before he pushed
Han Sen into the well.</p>
<p>“It’s fine if you don’t want me to take anymore, but you didn’t
have to push me into this well!” Han Sen felt depressed, finding
his body in the water.</p>
<p>Fortunately, the little monster had only pushed him and not hurt
him. Han Sen started to swim out, but he then noticed something
odd. The well had vanished, and he was now in a lake nestled
between two mountains.</p>
<p>“What is this place? And why am I here?” Han Sen was shocked as
he looked up at the sky.</p>
<p>It was nighttime, and there were two moons in the sky. Han Sen
now realized he was back on Planet Kate.</p>
<p>“I did not know Demon Grave had a teleporter. Those guys were
pretty nice.” Han Sen was so happy. He no longer had to worry about
Yisha ambushing him when he exited Demon Grave.</p>
<p>“Being nice always gives me a reward. Let me eat some fruit to
celebrate.” Han Sen opened the sack and was quickly given a shock.
The chameleon was sitting in the middle of all the fruit, and Han
Sen hadn’t a clue when the little creature had managed to sneak
inside.</p>
<p>“Damn! You sneaked out?” Han Sen asked as he picked the thing
up.</p>
<p>The little thing did not reply. It simply changed its color and
disappeared.</p>
<p>Far away, in the middle of the desert in Demon Grave, a bunch of
monsters were roaring. It was as if that noise was going to sunder
the skies.</p>
<p>“I can’t send you back now. I can’t go back to Demon Grave. If
you have no qualm with that, then you can come with me. But what
should I name you?” Han Sen receded into thought. After a lengthy
amount of time passed, he said, “How about I call you Sicko? That
name is cool.”</p>
<p>The transparent thing suddenly became red, and spikes covered
its skin. Its nose was breathing faster than usual.</p>
<p>“Uh…you don’t like it? Let’s think of another name then, Little
Homy Thing. How about Mister Chameleon? Horny Demon? Horny Wolf?
Horny Dragon? Transformer?”</p>
