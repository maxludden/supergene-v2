<p>“Shit! Why are they here?” Han Sen reacted immediately,
directing Little Star to dive back into the dark river.</p>
<p>Before Little Star escaped beneath the dark waters, Han Sen felt
a frightening wash of power come for him. Within one second, the
river was vaporized into nothing.</p>
<p>Han Sen summoned his Demon Bug King Bai Sema to block that
frightening attack, but the shield was damaged so much that it
cracked. It was on the precipice of shattering completely.</p>
<p>Fortunately, Edward didn’t really want to kill Han Sen until
they knew if he was carrying the relic. If they killed him right
where he was, and he didn’t have the relic on him, there was a
chance they’d never find it. If they had simply wanted him dead,
then the Demon Bug King Bai Sema wouldn’t have been able to survive
their attack. It would have broken.</p>
<p>Even so, the Demon Bug King Bai Sema could no longer be used.
So, Han Sen put it back in his Sea of Soul.</p>
<p>After Han Sen blocked the initial attack, Little Star ran into
the stone to try to escape.</p>
<p>But that stone wasn’t enough to stop Edward. A scary power
enveloped him, and the rocks were torn asunder in a path that
extended a thousand meters ahead. Crime ran forward as well, waving
his fists.</p>
<p>Han Sen guided Little Star onto a different route. It looked
like their pursuers had enough power to accomplish anything. The
underground rocks were like bubbles to them. One punch could cleave
a thousand-meter trench through the stone. Wherever Han Sen went,
they could catch up with him quickly.</p>
<p>It was like they had placed a tracking device on Han Sen. Even
though he and Little Star were keeping ahead of them, he could
never truly shake their hot-heeled pursuit.</p>
<p>“Han Sen, this matter doesn’t concern you! Give me the item, and
you can be allowed to live,” Mister White said.</p>
<p>“The item is mine. Why do I have to give it to you?” Han Sen
asked as he continued his flight. The stone plate was not theirs by
any right, so Han Sen had no plans of returning it to them—not in
the least.</p>
<p>“You don’t have the option of keeping the item. If you want to
live, you have to give it up. Do you want to live? Or do you want
to die because of it?” Ice Blue Knight King said.</p>
<p>“I want to live, but I also want the item,” Han Sen said.</p>
<p>Because Edward wasn’t willing to send a lethal strike after Han
Sen, the rocks were still shielding him adequately. So, Han Sen
could evade capture for the time being.</p>
<p>But he couldn’t keep running like that forever. Han Sen gritted
his teeth and let Little Star take him back to the palace.</p>
<p>Fox Queen was so angry. She was still grinding her teeth when
she suddenly heard a loud noise. She turned to see Han Sen and
Little Star bursting back out of the fish’s mouth.</p>
<p>Han Sen looked at Fox Queen, who was just gazing back at him. He
smiled awkwardly, “Pretty lady, I have been thinking… I miss you so
much, I couldn’t help but return.”</p>
<p>When Fox Queen saw him, a frown crossed her face. It was as if
she was trying to hear something, but she eventually squinted and
smiled back at Han Sen. “It looks like you have offended many
people. They are already right outside the palace. And they are
certainly quite strong.”</p>
<p>“Uh, those are not of any importance. You can feel free to
ignore those guys. They cannot break through the restrictions of
this place, anyway. Pretty lady, should we carry on with our
kissing game?” Han Sen said with a cough.</p>
<p>“I don’t want to play it now. I want to play something more
exciting.” Fox Queen waved her hand, and invisible cords of power
lashed around Han Sen and Little Star. She hung them from one of
the high beams of the palace, upside-down.</p>
<p>Fox Queen gripped a whip and approached the hanging Han Sen and
Little Star. She stroked Han Sen’s cheek and smiled. “You gave me a
big surprise earlier. How should I repay you?”</p>
<p>After that, Fox Queen raised her little whip. Han Sen hastily
pled, “Don’t do it, Pretty Lady! We should talk.”</p>
<p>“I only want to do this. I don’t want to talk!” Fox Queen’s
pretty face looked cold.</p>
<p>She used to be so strong in the geno universe. She had been
known as a powerful negotiator, and even negotiating with deified
elites didn’t put her at a disadvantage. She absolute hated Han
Sen, and she now wanted to teach him a lesson more than ever.</p>
<p>As they spoke, Fox Queen raised the whip in her hands. She
wanted to give him a deep lesson to vent some of her
frustration.</p>
<p>“Pretty Lady! Let us strike a bargain. I will help you escape
this place, and then there will be no reason for a grudge between
us,” Han Sen quickly said.</p>
<p>Fox Queen was shocked. She would have rolled her eyes if Han Sen
had made this offer before, but he had just proven his ability to
escape the palace. Now, she was starting to believe him.</p>
<p>“Are you playing games with me again?” Fox Queen smiled, but her
eyes looked frighteningly cold.</p>
<p>“If I lie to you, Big Sister, I will go straight down to hell,”
Han Sen frantically swore.</p>
<p>Fox Queen smiled, and she brushed Han Sen’s cheek and said,
“Such a good brother, always happy to give me surprises. How could
I possibly let you die?”</p>
<p>After that, Fox Queen’s smile turned cruel. The whip in her hand
straightened like a spike. And then, Fox Queen used it to stab.</p>
<p>The spiky whip pierced through Han Sen’s pants, almost catching
the family jewels as it went through. It slammed into the wall
behind Han Sen, and the lower half of his body turned to ice.</p>
<p>“If you lie to me again, I am going to make a eunuch out of
you.” Fox Queen grunted coldly, then returned to the jade bed. She
settled herself and looked at Han Sen. “Tell me, how are you going
to help me escape?”</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>“What is this place?” Edward looked at the wall in wonder.</p>
<p>They had chased Han Sen deeper and deeper into the planet,
clearing away the rocks as they went. But once they reached that
point, they were unable to break the stone anymore.</p>
<p>Even Ice Blue Knight King’s power could only trigger small puffs
of black air. The stone wall could not be damaged.</p>
<p>Edward began destroying all the stone that he could still break,
and they quickly realized that it was an underground stone palace.
Even their combined powers couldn’t harm it.</p>
<p>“I believe that Han Sen is hiding inside this stone palace. That
is why my power is unable to tell us where he is,” Mister White
said, as he stared at the stone palace.</p>
<p>“Mister White, is there a way we can gain access to the stone
palace?” Edward asked politely.</p>
<p>“I’m not very good with things like this. You would have a
better chance of breaking through than I would.” Mister White shook
his head.</p>
<p>“I don’t know who constructed this stone palace, but even our
own power isn’t enough to break through its perimeter. One thing is
for sure, though: whoever built it must have been a deified elite,”
Ice Blue Knight King said.</p>
<p>“Opening the palace with brute force is impossible. If we dig up
the entire stone palace, we might be able to find an entrance,
though,” Edward quietly said.</p>
<p>They had no choice. If they were to find an entrance, they had
to dig up the entire palace.</p>
<p>Han Sen had only come in and out of the palace via the waterway.
He didn’t know where the main entrance was, either.</p>
