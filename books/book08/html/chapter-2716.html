<p>Gru didn’t know what Han Sen was thinking, though. He looked
down at the two xenogeneics and said, “A Moon Rhino and an Immortal
Dragon. They are rare xenogeneics, but it is a shame they are only
King class. If they were deified, they would be worth a lot of
money. That would be especially true of the Immortal Dragon. If an
Immortal Dragon can become deified, then its substance chains can
make others practically immortal as well. For as long as the
Immortal Dragon retains its power, anyone it has vowed to protect
is essentially unkillable. It is a shame that deified Immortal
Dragons are incredibly rare. In all the history I have learned, I
have only heard of three deified Immortal Dragons.”</p>
<p>“Their powers aren’t sufficient at King class?” Han Sen asked
with curiosity.</p>
<p>Gru shook his head. “King class Immortal Dragons have a decent
area power, but the ability is only useful for healing some
external trauma. For most elites, that isn’t very useful. Taming
one of the creatures for that ability alone is hardly worth it.
Deified Immortal Dragons are a different story, however. They can
keep you alive in all sorts of situations. Many deified elites
would like to have a deified Immortal Dragon. Anyone would want
something that has the potential to save their lives.”</p>
<p>When he heard Gru say this, Han Sen’s heart jumped. He thought
to himself, “It is very lucky that I’ve found this Immortal Dragon
to use in my test. If the black crystal really works, maybe I can
get a deified Immortal Dragon.”</p>
<p>“Brother Han, the deified xenogeneic I want to kill is in Full
Moon River. It is only 200 miles from here. If you have the time,
maybe we can go there?” Gru said hopefully to Han Sen.</p>
<p>“I want to get a xenogeneic as a mount. Based on what you’ve
told me, the Immortal Dragon doesn’t seem too bad. I think I’ll
capture that Immortal Dragon. Once I have the Immortal Dragon, if
you still haven’t killed the deified xenogeneic on your own, I can
go as well to help you out.” If Gru’s xenogeneic was really that
nearby, Han Sen wouldn’t mind going after it.</p>
<p>“Sure. I will stay here and wait for you. It is just an Immortal
Dragon, so I am sure you will get it easily.” Gru smiled.</p>
<p>Han Sen didn’t care if the man stayed. It would only be a matter
of time before others found out he was catching a xenogeneic. There
was no way to hide it, but neither was there a need to.</p>
<p>The two of them waited where they were for a while. The Immortal
Dragon was beating the pulp out of the Moon Rhino; with its
immortal area active, the Immortal Dragon was impervious to the
rhino’s attacks.</p>
<p>In the end, Han Sen and Gru watched the Immortal Dragon open its
mouth and choke down the badly injured Moon Rhino.</p>
<p>The rhino’s body was much bigger than the Immortal Dragon’s
body. After the Immortal Dragon swallowed its foe, its body
expanded like a big balloon. Han Sen wondered if the dragon could
actually digest something so large.</p>
<p>But for Han Sen, this was a very good opportunity. The Immortal
Dragon had eaten the entire Moon Rhino, and it was now settling
down to digest its meal. It wasn’t paying much attention to its
surroundings.</p>
<p>Han Sen flew toward it and fired out an array of silks from his
knife. Han Sen lifted his finger, and the knife silks tied up the
Immortal Dragon.</p>
<p>Immortal Dragon was terrified. It shivered in fear, but when it
tried to run away, the knife silks tightened and cut into the
creature’s body. Although its area was obscenely powerful, it
wouldn’t help much if the dragon sliced itself into pieces.</p>
<p>Once it had recovered, the creature tried to struggle free
again. It was worried about being cut, though. Eventually, the
Immortal Dragon realized that it couldn’t escape the knife silks
without killing itself. It stopped moving, carefully trying not to
touch the knife silks circling its body.</p>
<p>“It seems to be fairly intelligent,” Han Sen said with a laugh.
And then, he lifted a hand and drew slowly on the knife silks. The
Immortal Dragon immediately responded to the tug, slithering
forward across the ground to keep the silks from drawing tight
again.</p>
<p>But the Moon Rhino was still in the creature’s belly. The
roundness of its stomach made it difficult for the Immortal Dragon
to slither forward. It moved way too slow, and the knife silks cut
into the beast’s scales. Each cut caused the creature to release a
nasty screech.</p>
<p>“You are good, Brother Han. The power to create these silks and
control them with masterful precision… You aren’t too far off the
talent of a genuine deified elite,” Gru complimented him.</p>
<p>“You’re laying it on thick.” Han Sen was still suspicious that
Gru might be harboring ulterior motives.</p>
<p>Even if Gru wasn’t a part of the Bai family, there were many
within the Extreme King that hated Han Sen. Han Sen doubted that
Gru was as detached as he seemed.</p>
<p>But now that he had agreed to go with Gru, he no longer had an
excuse to delay their venture. He left the Immortal Dragon trapped
in the knife silks. Every hour the fiend spent in captivity would
grind at its mind. Han Sen then turned to follow Gru deep up Full
Moon River.</p>
<p>Han Sen still suspected that Gru might have a conspiracy up his
sleeve, but when they reached their destination, Han Sen was
relieved to find that there really was a deified xenogeneic on the
riverbank.</p>
<p>That xenogeneic looked like a wolf. Its hair was grey, but it
had four eyes. Its fangs were like hooks. The beast looked
extremely evil.</p>
<p>As they made their way up the river, Gru had told Han Sen that
the deified xenogeneic was talented with eye skills. Its eyes
released an indestructible godlight. The creature’s attacks were
shockingly fast. Gru wouldn’t have lasted long on his own.</p>
<p>The four-eyed wolf saw Gru, and it howled angrily and got to its
feet. Its four eyes opened wide, and a weird green light began to
glow inside them. The beast suddenly released four green beams that
shot right toward Gru.</p>
<p>Clearly, the four-eyed wolf really hated Gru. It was obvious
that this wasn’t the first time Gru had come to challenge the
beast.</p>
<p>Gru already had experience dealing with the wolf. When he saw
the creature’s four green lights coming, he pulled out a shield and
used it to protect his body.</p>
<p>Gru’s shield looked oddly fragile. It resembled a silver mirror,
and it seemed like a single punch would be enough to crack it.</p>
<p>But when those four scary substance chains struck the weird
shield, the reflective surface of the glass bounced them away. Gru
remained unharmed.</p>
<p>“What a strong shield!” Han Sen said in praise.</p>
<p>Gru was half-deified, and yet he was able to use his shield to
deflect the substance chains of a deified xenogeneic without much
difficulty. Clearly, the strange shield was something truly
unique.</p>
<p>Gru laughed. “Mister Xun lent me this deified treasure. This
shield can deflect eye skills and visual skills. I borrowed it so I
could deal with this four-eyed wolf. It is embarrassing, but the
mirror shield can only block the four-eyed wolf’s eyelights. It
does not, however, lend me additional speed. And I still can’t
block the creature’s physical attacks. I cannot hurt it, and yet,
it almost kills me each time.”</p>
<p>After pausing, Gru looked at Han Sen and said, “Brother Han, you
have the Apollo Set. With the speed gifted to you by the armor’s
wings, you should be able to keep up with the wolf. When it uses
its eyelights again, I will use the mirror shield to block. Then,
you take that opportunity to swoop in and strike.”</p>
<p>“Sure.” Han Sen nodded. However, Han Sen was silently thinking,
“I have just absorbed the ice geno core, which should have given me
some new powers. Now I can give it a spin and see what it
does.”</p>
