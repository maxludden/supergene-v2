<p>“God Chaos Party Leader did not lie to me. I am able to feel
Bao’er.” Han Sen was thrilled by this. He also sensed that Bao’er
could now feel him as well. He knew she was coming his way.</p>
<p>“God Chaos Party Leader said she would be able to help me sort
out how to navigate through the 33 skies. I wonder if she has
sorted that out for me yet.” Han Sen ceased his hesitation. He
bowed to the jade statue and returned to the rat hole.</p>
<p>He ignored big sky demon and the others. He returned via the way
he came in. He reached the entrance where the Evil God Beard proved
troublesome. This time, before Han Sen could even get close to the
Evil God Beard, the Evil God Beard moved back. It was like it was
meeting someone scary. It hurried away to avoid him.</p>
<p>Han Sen rushed out from the copper tablet and peered into Dust
Sky’s sky. He then flew up high. He headed into space. He wanted to
break the Dust Sky barrier and reach the next sky.</p>
<p>Han Sen felt that Bao’er was someplace above him. Although he
did not know which floor, he knew she was above him.</p>
<p>When Han Sen reached Dust Sky’s barrier, he felt a lot of
pressure. The rule powers of Dust Sky were attempting to suppress
him.</p>
<p>He suddenly felt a weird, clear message surge through his body’s
cells. Dust Sky’s rule powers combined and made Han Sen go through
the barrier and reach the 11th sky.</p>
<p>The 11th sky was a flower world. It was full of flowers and
vines. There were countless swarms of bees and butterflies soaring
through the skies, harvesting nectar.</p>
<p>Han Sen had only just entered the 11th sky when he felt as if
there was a weird power landing on him. Because he had the weird
spirit power protecting him, the rule powers did not invade his
body. With that spirit power mixing, it accepted him.</p>
<p>“The God Chaos Party’s leader really is different. It was only a
remnant of her soul that did this, yet it clearly demonstrates vast
power.” Han Sen could not help but compliment it.</p>
<p>In fact, Han Sen overestimated the God Chaos Party Leader’s
leftover spirit power. Aside from the fact that the God Chaos Party
was very strong, the reason why this happened was due to another
important reason. She used to be the geno tablet’s master. She was
the one that designed the 33 skies. No one could be more
understanding of the ways that place worked than her. Although she
was not the master of the geno tablet anymore, she could still use
some of her power to enable Han Sen to have a free reign of travel
in the 33 skies.</p>
<p>Han Sen did not stop. He kept going up to a higher place. He
could tell that Bao’er was not in the 11th sky. She was somewhere
higher, so that was where Han Sen was going to go.</p>
<p>Han Sen kept breaking through all the skies he could. The
barriers of the 33 skies were unable to deny his passing. The
spirit power’s presence combined with the barriers each time. It
made the barriers become a part of Han Sen, letting him pass
through easily each time.</p>
<p>Han Sen felt Bao’er’s presence become stronger with each sky he
scaled. Bao’er was happily flying toward him at the same time.
There was only one sky left separating the two.</p>
<p>Han Sen broke through the barrier again, reaching the 15th sky.
This time, he could feel Bao’er was nearby.</p>
<p>Of course, before Han Sen saw Bao’er, he had already heard
Bao’er’s voice in the distance. She indicated that she was on the
way just as he was for her. “Dad! I cannot believe it. After all
this time, it looks like I have finally found you.”</p>
<p>When Han Sen saw Bao’er, she had already jumped to him. Beside
her was a flying fish, and a small cat lying on her head. When Han
Sen held her, he complained. “Did I not ask you to wait in the
Feng’s family castle? Why did you come to this place all alone? I
should hit you.”</p>
<p>After Han Sen said that, he lifted his hands and smacked Bao’er
on the bum. He raised his hands high but smacked gently.</p>
<p>Bao’er blushed. “There was this old man saying you were in
danger in this place. He told me to go and help you, but he was
clearly lying. You are doing just fine here. How dare that old man
curse you. The next time I see him, I am going to twist his ears
off.”</p>
<p>Han Sen was shocked. He looked at Bao’er as he asked her, “Old
Liar? Do you mean Han Jinzhi?”</p>
<p>“Yes, it was that Old Liar,” Bao’er said with a nod.</p>
<p>Han Sen’s face changed. He thought, “What did Han Jinzhi mean?
Why would he trick Bao’er into going to the 33 skies? Does he know
Bao’er’s true identity? Plus, who really is Han Jinzhi?”</p>
<p>Han Sen was still so curious about who Han Jinzhi was. Even now,
he was not sure if Han Jinzhi was his real family.</p>
<p>Suddenly, Han Sen’s heart jumped. He quickly clutched Bao’er and
left the area.</p>
<p>Pang!</p>
<p>A beam of fire suddenly came down from the sky. It was like
spring water, but the beam of fire was a pure beam of fire. It blew
30,000 feet into the sky and came to an end.</p>
<p>Han Sen held Bao’er. He looked in a certain direction. He saw
something red with wings on its back. It looked like a tiger. Its
tail was still burning with fire. It was a Break World beast. It
was standing on a cliff, staring at Han Sen and Bao’er.</p>
<p>“How dare you enter my 15th sky. Do you have a death wish or
something?” The Break World beast roared. It was a roar that
shocked the sky. Its roar shocked the whole sky.</p>
<p>The whole 15th sky shook because of its roar. It was like a big
earthquake. Fire geysers kept opening up on the ground. Each one
sent 30,000-foot-hight pillars of fire into the sky. It made the
15th sky look like purgatory.</p>
<p>Break World beast had a weird fire-like symbol on its forehead.
It created a resonance in the 15th sky. The 15th sky’s fire power
kept going to the Break World beast, making the Break World beast’s
presence and atmosphere become scarier.</p>
<p>At the same time, the geno tablet’s 15th sky text started to
light up. It was like a fire that was burning. It was brighter than
the text of any sky.</p>
<p>Fifteenth Sky Leader: Ultimate Tail Fire Beast</p>
<p>The main and the reverse universe creatures could see the geno
tablet, but they had no idea what was going on.</p>
<p>The 15th sky’s leader had only appeared a few days ago, but it
was now lighting up again. That had never happened before.</p>
<p>Before, all the leaders of each sky would only have their names
shine on the tablet when a sky was first claimed.</p>
<p>Now, the 15th sky’s leader’s name was flickering again. That had
to mean it was something quite profound.</p>
<p>As the 15th sky and its leader’s name flickered, everyone in the
33 skies, which looked like a headstone, were curious. Han Sen saw
a ring shining on the geno tablet. If he calculated correctly, he
knew it was not too hard to take over the 15th sky.</p>
