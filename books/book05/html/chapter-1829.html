<p>After the eleventh knife rain, there were so many knives on the
ground. They were all over the place, and there was hardly a place
to step.</p>
<p>Han Sen’s feet walked across the handles, and Black Steel was
standing in front of a knife. Han Sen thought the knife looked
fairly normal.</p>
<p>But Black Steel looked surprised. He pulled it out carefully and
held it with both hands. He happily said, “This is a Duke
weapon!”</p>
<p>“It doesn’t look like one.” Han Sen saw the dim-looking light of
the blade, and felt impartial towards it.</p>
<p>“We are in the Knife Grave. It is still sleeping, mind you: the
power is suppressed. Once you leave this place, you’ll be able to
see how great this is.” After that, Black Steel gave the knife to
Han Sen. “The knife you have wanted me to find you is this. Now, we
no longer owe each other anything.”</p>
<p>“You don’t want it?” Han Sen waved it around a bit. It felt
great, but Han Sen was not wholly satisfied.</p>
<p>“There is still a lot of time to go, so there is the chance I’ll
be able to find another.” Black Steel continued walking. He didn’t
look back once.</p>
<p>Han Sen followed Black Steel for a long time, and marveled at
the amount he knew about the place. After the eleventh knife rain,
there were many more higher-tier weapons on the ground. But finding
something of Duke class was still not a simple task. Aside from
having the ability to spot one, you’d need more than a modicum of
luck.</p>
<p>On that giant planet, which was covered in millions of knives,
finding a Duke weapon would be harder than finding a needle in a
haystack.</p>
<p>There were more higher-tier knives, but the ordinary ones still
rained in countless numbers. The ratio of good knives and bad
knives didn’t change, though. There were just more of both.</p>
<p>Black Steel had randomly given Han Sen the Duke knife, which had
surprised Han Sen.</p>
<p>The land was wide. Han Sen and Black Steel were like two ants,
afloat in a sharp sea. Knives were everywhere, and the sight of
them made Han Sen’s eyes go funny.</p>
<p>Han Sen swore he had never seen so many knives in his life
before.</p>
<p>Time passed, and Black Steel was unable to find another Duke
knife. He hadn’t been able to find a Marquise one, even.</p>
<p>It looked like the Duke knife had exhausted both of their
luck.</p>
<p>Boom!</p>
<p>The ground began to rumble as the volcano of knives began to
rattle and shake again. The pillar fired up into the sky and
illuminated the clouds. It made the sky look like an ocean of
lava.</p>
<p>“Again!” Han Sen shouted at Black Steel. He pulled out the Duke
scimitar and looked up at the crimson clouds.</p>
<p>Black Steel raised his head and stood up straight. He was
holding two knives now. One of them was the horse knife, and the
other was a short knife. The latter was an Earl weapon.</p>
<p>Boom!</p>
<p>The lava in the sky rumbled and roared like thunder. The knives
came soaring down, dripping with the steel juice of their
origin.</p>
<p>The sky was filled by what looked like an endless display of
meteors.</p>
<p>Han Sen looked grim. They were all Viscount weapons, and they
were accelerating as they descended to the ground with full
power.</p>
<p>Han Sen was holding a Duke weapon, but its power was asleep. Han
Sen needed his power to activate it. But being the Baron he was,
there was a limit to what he was able to do. So, all he had to rely
on was the sharpness of the blade itself.</p>
<p>In the eleventh rain, Han Sen had seen how powerful a Viscount’s
sword could be. He and Black Steel had barely managed to hold on
and make it through. This knife rain was much scarier than the
eleventh, though; that much was for certain.</p>
<p>Pang! Pang! Pang! Pang!</p>
<p>All the knives came racing down like a barrage of infinite
missiles. They annihilated the earth, as countless knives shattered
into pieces.</p>
<p>The scariest thing about all of this was how the knife rain was
falling. It wasn’t a shower; it was a fuH-on heavy rain that did
not seem to relent.</p>
<p>Han Sen was waving his Duke knife. He clutched it tight,
swinging at every knife that looked set to land on him. His finesse
insured none touched him.</p>
<p>But Han Sen only had one knife, and he did not have a shield. He
cut the knives that were raining down from directly above, but he
wasn’t able to cut the ones that were in his proximity.</p>
<p>The falling knives exploded when struck, shattering. Many were
broken, scattershotting Han Sen. They gave him a number of cuts,
proving his Baron armor could not stop them.</p>
<p>Black Steel was faring much worse, though. Han Sen had mutant
blood power, so his wounds would not bleed. If he hurt his skin, he
could still keep going. But Black Steel could bleed, and he was
soaked with the many lacerations that covered his body.</p>
<p>The knives rained down like a bombing run. It was scarier than
the blitz. At least bombings sometimes provided a gap or berth to
breathe: these knives wouldn’t stop for a moment</p>
<p>Han Sen’s Duke knife was sharp, but hitting those knives made
his arm numb. His hands slowly began to crack.</p>
<p>The knife rain, after lasting ten minutes, showed no sign of
stopping.</p>
<p>Han Sen and Black Steel were fighting the knives back-to-back.
They both held a side, and slowly, things began to get better.</p>
<p>“This knife rain is lasting too long! We can’t hold on. We have
to leave!” Han Sen shouted, as he continued slashing and
slashing.</p>
<p>“You go first! I haven’t found the knife I am looking for,”
Black Steel said, while swinging his knife like a madman.</p>
<p>“I’ll give you mine, and I’ll take any,” Han Sen said.</p>
<p>“It’s yours, not mine,” Black Steel said calmly.</p>
<p>“Are you crazy?” Han Sen kept swinging his knife.</p>
<p>“You leave first,” Black Steel insisted, continuing to wave his
knife.</p>
<p>“F*ck no!” Han Sen slashed, cutting through a number of knives
that were about to skewer his head.</p>
<p>Boom!</p>
<p>The sky trumpeted with thunderous sounds again. The lava in the
sky seemed to explode. The rain poured from the sky. Knives!
Countless knives!</p>
<p>The knives came down like a torrential flood. They streamed down
from above with the strength of a raging river. It’d be enough to
destroy the sky and earth.</p>
