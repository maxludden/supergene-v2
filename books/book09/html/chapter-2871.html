<h2>Pluto Peacock</h2>
<h3>Chapter 2871</h3>

<p>Pluto Peacock had many black feathers. Its neck and other places
had blue feathers and green feathers. Its eyes had some feathers
with two colors, from blue to green. It also had blue eyeballs and
green pupils.</p>
<p>From what Han Sen could tell, Pluto Peacock had reached
butterfly class not too long ago. It had become true god class in a
recent deathmatch. Its power was not solid yet. It was one of the
weaker enemies of the deified fights, so it selected the enemy that
was one higher than him.</p>
<p>Aside from Pluto Peacock, there were still two people lower than
it. That was the butterfly class Han Sen and Burning Lamp. Han Sen
had killed a god spirit, which was really scary. Pluto Peacock did
not dare do anything to him. It saw the butterfly Burning Lamp at
number 84, so it fancied challenging him.</p>
<p>Burning Lamp looked dim, but he was not afraid of his opponent.
Getting into the top 100 was a mission that he accomplished well.
It would have been great if he could win. Getting number 99 was not
too bad for Burning Lamp. After all, reaching position 99 still
guaranteed him a true god weapon. Getting a true god weapon for
Buddha was the most thing he could do for Buddha in the waning
twilight of his life.</p>
<p>Burning Lamp was not planning on giving up now. Being at number
84 was better than number 99. Aside from a true god weapon at such
a rank, he could obtain a true god material. So, Burning Lamp
fancied giving it a go. Facing a true god class Pluto Peacock,
Burning Lamp did not dare to be careless. He pulled out a knife
hidden within his Buddha clothing.</p>
<p>The knife looked a bit weird. It had the shape of a knife, but
it did not have a blade. It was like it had not been pulled out.
Although it had not been pulled out, there was some buddha light on
the body. It was like it was surrounded by a buddha light. It
looked kind of holy.</p>
<p>It sort of looks like my knife blank, but it does not look like
it. Han Sen could not tell whether it was his knife blank or not,
but the buddha light that came from the knife looked like Sky Demon
Power. It seemed as if it possessed some sort of cause power, but
it was not so pure like Sky Demon Power. It was mixed with another
sort of power.</p>
<p>Han Sen looked at God and asked, “Does Buddha have cause
powers?” He was not entirely sure what sort of powers Buddha
commanded.</p>
<p>God laughed. “The potential of the Buddha is not too good. It
was difficult for them to become a higher race, so they learned a
little bit out of every race and compiled it all into their own
teachings. It is how they survived. That includes their Filling
skill. They learned that from one of the dragon’s blood skills.
There are many situations like this. The buddha use all sorts of
different skills, but none of them are</p>
<p>pure.”</p>
<p>“Do they have the cause power from the demons?” Han Sen asked.
“Not exactly,” God said. “The cause power inside the knife exists
independently. It is different from the demons, so that is why I
think it is interesting.”</p>
<p>“After all, you do not even know what that knife is, right” Han
Sen finally understood.</p>
<p>“There are too many weird things in this universe. It is
perfectly normal for me not to know.” God laughed. While they were
talking, Pluto Peacock suddenly screamed. The back of the peacock
opened. The feathers that looked like eyes released some weird eye
light. It made the whole of space turn into a weird green and blue
color. It felt as if a scary movie was being filmed. “Although
Pluto Peacock is just a xenogeneic that does not have many geno
arts like a high race, its Pluto powers are very special,” God
said. “If he cannot break it, even a true god class would
lose.”</p>
<p>“I do not see anything special about it. You make it sound all
spooky and powerful, but Burning Lamp is not hurt.” Han Sen saw
Burning Lamp covered in a green and blue light. He was not hurt. He
felt weird too.</p>
<p>“That is why Pluto powers are so scary,” God said. “In the
universe, isn’t there a saying that ‘time is an invisible,
pig-killing knife?’ Their underworld god area is from life to
death. In the underworld, living creatures turn into dead spirits.
Then, the underworld leader will consume them.”</p>
<p>Han Sen was shocked. He used the Dongxuan Area to look at Pluto
Peacock’s underworld god area. He saw the weird green and blue
light consuming Burning Lamp’s body. His cells were turning green
and blue. Burning Lamp swung the knife at Pluto Peacock, but Pluto
Peacock was invincible. Burning Lamp’s knife light was going to
touch its body, but the knife went clean through it. He was unable
to harm it.</p>
<p>Burning Lamp was using many different geno arts, but none of
them could touch Pluto Peacock’s body. Pluto Peacock was standing
in the underworld with its rear peacock feathers shining an
underworld light.</p>
<p>After a long time of this, Burning Lamp’s skin started to turn
into a weird green and blue color. It looked rather transparent.
One was able to see his skin and blood vessels on the inside.</p>
<p>The longer this went on, the more underworld-like Burning Lamp
was looking. He could not do anything to Pluto Peacock.</p>
<p>“It looks like the knife’s cause power is worse than the demon,”
Han Sen said. “It cannot cut off cause power.”</p>
<p>“Although they are cause powers, they are not of the same type,”
God said. “It is like the same types of iron. Some irons are used
to make knives whereas some irons are made to create shields. They
are different.”</p>
<p>“What is the function of that knife?” Han Sen asked.</p>
<p>“You will find out if you keep watching,” God said with a smile.
He did not answer Han Sen’s question.</p>
<p>Burning Lamp seemed to be suppressed before Pluto Peacock. No
matter what geno art he used, he could not hurt Pluto Peacock. His
body gradually became more transparent. He was like a blue and
green crystal. You could even see the organs inside him.</p>
<p>Han Sen felt a bit sad. In the past, he seemed to be so strong.
Burning Lamp had even turned him into an ant. Now, he was just
this.</p>
<p>“It looks like power really does determine everything,” Han Sen
said with a sigh.</p>
<p>Han Sen did not believe Burning Lamp would concede so easily.
Burning Lamp was a pious individual. If he did not think he could
win, he would leave. He would not stay and risk his life.</p>
<p>He was now in a terrible position, yet he showed no sign of
wanting to give up. He clearly had a plan.</p>
<p>Han Sen could not figure out how Burning Lamp would triumph over
his enemy. From the beginning, up until now, the knife in his hand
was not affected by the underworld area. It was still shining with
a buddha light. It was not affected by the underworld lamp.</p>
<p>Burning Lamp’s body was becoming half-empty. Pluto Peacock’s
eyes flashed. It opened its mouth and started sucking Burning Lamp.
Burning Lamp was unable to control his body. He ended up flying
toward Pluto Peacock’s mouth and was instantly gone. Pluto Peacock
swallowed Burning Lamp. It felt so happy that it screamed. It
closed up its peacock feathers. The underworld area was gone. When
all the audience believed the fight to be over, Pluto Peacock
started screaming. Its chest and belly were suddenly cut open. God
blood was pouring out. The knife Burning Lamp was holding had a
buddha light. It came out from the wound.</p>
