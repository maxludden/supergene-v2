<p>A powerful elite like that gave Han Sen a lot of inspiration.
The most special thing about it was the ability of the monkey to
clone itself.</p>
<p>Not even Han Sen could tell when the monkey was using its true
self or its copy during the battle. The real monkey and the fakes
were far too difficult to distinguish. Anyone who wasn’t careful
would certainly end up falling for its tricks.</p>
<p>But Han Sen was hesitating, trying to decide if he should help
Shale. Eventually, a Very High man approached him. Han Sen jerked
slightly in surprise when he saw the man; he hadn’t noticed when
the Very High man arrived next to him.</p>
<p>“Li Chun Qiu?” Han Sen recognized the man upon seeing his
face.</p>
<p>Li Chun Qiu was very famous amongst the Very High. He was the
elder brother of Exquisite and the others. He was very talented,
and no one in the Very High could match him. Not even Li Keer, who
had a ten armor talent.</p>
<p>Li Chun Qiu watched Shale and the monkey doing battle, and he
said, “Do not help him. He must experience this fight himself.”</p>
<p>When Han Sen heard those words, he relaxed. Evidently, he didn’t
need to bother helping Shale.</p>
<p>Shale was at a disadvantage, but he wasn’t too injured to
continue fighting just yet. He was still holding his own against
the six-eared monkey. And as time went by, Shale began to take
fewer and fewer wounds.</p>
<p>Li Chun Qiu had just been standing there quietly watching the
fight, but he suddenly said, “What do you think of Shale’s recent
improvements?”</p>
<p>Han Sen looked around. He was the only person nearby. Clearly,
Li Chun Qiu had to be talking to him. But Li Chun Qiu was still
watching the fight, and he hadn’t looked at Han Sen while he asked
the question.</p>
<p>“He has improved very quickly. It makes sense that he has an
eleven armor talent,” Han Sen said. And it was truthful, mostly.
Shale’s improvements did impress him.</p>
<p>Li Chun Qiu didn’t move. As he watched the battle unfold, he
said, “This blonde monkey is an ancient xenogeneic called the
Six-Eared Macaque. Its genes are very strong, and it is born with a
ten armor talent. And its flesh is so powerful. Its mind is very
tricky to discern. It is always hard to tell whether you’re looking
at the real monkey or another fake. It is hard to find an enemy
like this at the same level. Even Shale, who is a born deified,
cannot beat the Six-Eared Macaque easily.”</p>
<p>“With Brother Shale’s power, he simply needs a little time. He
will beat the Six-Eared Macaque eventually,” Han Sen said.</p>
<p>Li Chun Qiu nodded and said, “I’m not worried about that. The
Six-Eared Macaque is a small task for Shale. Taking it down won’t
be very difficult.”</p>
<p>Speaking of that, Li Chun Qiu finally turned to look at Han Sen.
He said, “Actually, the only person that can be considered a
serious obstacle to Shale is you.”</p>
<p>“You must be joking, sir. I’m just a half-deified. I don’t have
what it would take to impede Shale’s growth.” Han Sen wasn’t going
to accept some random compliment to boost his ego.</p>
<p>Li Chun Qiu didn’t reply to that. He went on to say, “I’m in
charge of the Very High’s Good Fortune Pool. If you need to, I can
let you visit it.”</p>
<p>“What does that mean?” Han Sen asked, struggling to follow the
conversation. Li Chun Qiu jumped around a lot when he spoke. He had
just been describing Han Sen as Shale’s biggest impediment, and now
he was telling Han Sen that he could go to the Very High’s Good
Fortune Pool.</p>
<p>Opportunities to enter the Very High’s Good Fortune Pool weren’t
granted to everyone. Han Sen had heard about the pool before he
even came to the Very High. Even Exquisite and Li Keer had never
received approval to enter it. Therefore, Han Sen hadn’t yet had a
chance to go there.</p>
<p>Now, Li Chun Qiu was offering him the opportunity to go. It was
confusing.</p>
<p>Li Chun Qiu knew what Han Sen was thinking, so he coldly said,
“You have become Shale’s demon. If he cannot beat you for real, it
will be an impediment to his growth and ascension. He might lose
the chance to become a true god. So, I hope you can become deified
soon. Then, Shale will have a chance to defeat the demon that
ravages his soul.”</p>
<p>Li Chun Qiu seemed to think that even if Han Sen became deified,
Shale could probably beat him. But Han Sen didn’t mind that.</p>
<p>Han Sen was used to other people being arrogant around him.
Where was the harm in letting someone else be a bit cocky?</p>
<p>“If you are really making this offer, then thank you very much,
sir. When can I go to the Very High’s Good Fortune Pool, if you
don’t mind me asking?” Han Sen wanted to pin this down as quickly
as he could.</p>
<p>After all, Han Sen still had another two geno arts he needed to
raise to half-deified. Maybe he could use the Very High’s Good
Fortune Pool to break through with them.</p>
<p>The Good Fortune Pool of the Very High was quite mysterious. It
could increase the potency of one’s genes and blood exponentially.
Han Sen had wanted to go there for some time, and now this was his
chance.</p>
<p>“Take this Good Fortune Spell. After today, you can go
whenever.” Li Chun Qiu handed Han Sen a small spell.</p>
<p>Han Sen accepted the spell, and he noticed that the object was
only two fingers in width. It looked crystal clear, and it said
Good Fortune on it in an ancient language.</p>
<p>“Thank you, sir. I’m going to try to become deified so that
Brother Shale can put his demons to sleep.” Han Sen put the Good
Fortune Spell in his chest pocket. Then, he smiled at Li Chun Qiu.
Inside, however, he was thinking, “The Very High really are quite
rich. He is just randomly giving permission for someone to enter
the Good Fortune Pool. And in a way, he gave it to an enemy.”</p>
<p>Li Chun Qiu glanced at Han Sen with interest, and he said, “You
are a really interesting character. If it wasn’t for Shale and Yu
Shanxin, I would say you were the most interesting silkworm in this
generation.”</p>
<p>Li Chun Qiu’s words seemed to indicate that he thought Han Sen
was weaker than Shale and Yu Shanxin. Within that generation of
silkworms, he was only number three.</p>
<p>Han Sen was in no mood to argue, though. In a way, he was quite
happy.</p>
<p>As the two of them talked, Shale had become more and more
stable. The Six-Eared Macaque no longer had the advantage, and it
was on the verge of being suppressed by Shale. Its real and fake
bodies were no longer confusing Shale.</p>
<p>Han Sen had to admit that Shale was a genius. In a short amount
of time, he had been able to study the Six-Eared Macaque.</p>
<p>Han Sen suddenly thought of a question about the Six-Eared
Macaque. He looked at Li Chun Qiu and asked, “Mister, how did you
know which Star Fruit held the Six-Eared Macaque?”</p>
<p>Exquisite and Li Keer told him that the xenogeneics inside a
Star Fruit couldn’t be guessed from the outside. But Li Chun Qiu
and Shale obviously knew what to expect from the fruit they had
chosen. They knew it would be the Six-Eared Macaque.</p>
<p>“The Very High Sense can grant a useful predictive ability,” Li
Chun Qiu answered. “I spent some time looking over this tree
thoroughly, and after much deliberation, I came to the realization
of where this creature lay. Plus, this Star Fruit was born
strangely. It was easy for me to guess what was inside.”</p>
<p>“Born strangely?” Han Sen tilted his head to the side as he
looked at Li Chun Qiu.</p>
<p>“When this fruit was formed, a weird, gold shadow fell over the
Star Tree. I wasn’t too far away from the Star Tree when I saw this
strange scene. Based on what I saw, it wasn’t difficult for me to
determine what xenogeneic might have been found in that fruit,” Li
Chun Qiu said levelly.</p>
