	<p>Miss Mirror sat in front of her computer. She looked at the information on the screen, locked in deep thought.
	</p>

	<p>All the documents pertained to Han Sen. It was everything that had been recorded of him since the fight when Kong
		Fei had snuffed out and relit a lantern. It informed her of everything he did, all the way up until he disguised
		himself as Bai Yi. The records of it were all there.</p>

	<p>“Such a scary guy. These records make his life look like he’s playing with cheat codes. He has done way too many
		unbelievable things. It is difficult to imagine that a leftover crystallizer, starting from scratch, achieved
		all that he has today.” The investigation was very thorough. Miss Mirror had to admit that if she had been in
		the same situation as Han Sen, she wouldn’t have been able to achieve half of what Han Sen had managed to.</p>

	<p>“It is a shame that he isn’t really Bai Yi. Otherwise, with his performance amongst the Extreme King, he might
		have become a legendary figure for us.” Miss Mirror sighed. She turned off the computer and rubbed her temples.
	</p>

	<p>She had been tired for a while. The person who had her Mirror Spirit Eye Ring was disguising himself as a prince.
		It made things rather difficult for her. She couldn’t tell King Bai about it, but neither could she lie to him.
		And King Bai wasn’t an easy man to fool. Lying to him might lead her down a path she could never return from.
	</p>

	<p>“Radiowave should be investigating Han Sen. If they start uncovering his secrets too quickly, things might go
		badly for me. And if I had Han Sen over, I’m afraid the Mirror Spirit Eye won’t be able to withstand the same
		dosage of damage again.” Miss Mirror was beginning to develop a headache.</p>

	<p>Miss Mirror closed her eyes to think, but she couldn’t figure out a solution that was perfect for her.</p>

	<p>A subordinate knocked at her door. “Miss Mirror, the location of the seven-five-six-eight God Battle Ruin has
		been confirmed.”</p>

	<p>“Give me the information.” Miss Mirror sat up straight, looking like a lady again.</p>

	<p>The subordinate pushed open the door and set the documents down in front of her. Miss Mirror examined them for a
		while and frowned. She said, “Another race has been found? At Ruin 7568?”</p>

	<p>“Yes, my lady. Our people found a big excavation site, and some construction zones started up not too long ago,”
		the subordinate explained.</p>

	<p>“Okay, that’s all for now.” Miss Mirror set the documents back down on the table. She closed her eyes and
		thought.</p>

	<p>A while later, she opened her eyes. She glanced over the pages again, then finally smiled. She said out loud,
		“Ruin 7568… If that is the one, perhaps I can convince my brother. I can take Han Sen there. This is an
		opportunity.”</p>

	<hr />

	<p>For the first time in a while, things were going smoothly. Han Sen had the small furnace to show him the way, and
		he had collected many core xenogeneic genes. Now, he was holding four. He ate two and tossed the others to the
		furnace.</p>

	<p>It wasn’t because Han Sen was a waster. It was just because he couldn’t digest them. Even with Consume’s help, he
		could only eat two a day. If he wanted to gain one hundred King class genes, it would take more than a month.
	</p>

	<p>Because the small furnace behaved well, Han Sen gave it a few core xenogeneic genes whenever he could. The small
		furnace was always delighted to receive them.</p>

	<p>Swords from the Furnace required core xenogeneic genes for production. But core genes from different xenogeneics
		could create different swords inside the furnace.</p>

	<p>“No wonder that big furnace was so strong. All the swords it produced came from King xenogeneic genes. I can’t
		even guess how many King class core xenogeneics it managed to kill in its time. Too bad the xenogeneic genes are
		melted down inside the furnace. If a furnace is destroyed, the swords are also destroyed. Otherwise, I’d have
		received enough xenogeneic genes to last me many lives over,” Han Sen thought with regret.</p>

	<p>The small furnace followed Han Sen and collected a few treats on the way. When Han Sen left the core area, it
		didn’t run off. It waited for Han Sen to come back.</p>

	<p>A few days later, the small furnace was forging a few sword blanks.</p>

	<p>Han Sen thought this relaxed schedule would last for some time, but when Miss Mirror showed up, she destroyed his
		delusions of just enjoying life for a while.</p>

	<p>“Pack your stuff, you have a mission to go on,” Miss Mirror said before taking a sip of tea.</p>

	<p>“What mission?” Han Sen asked with trepidation. Miss Mirror had asked him to pack, so that meant he was leaving
		King’s Kingdom.</p>

	<p>“This is your father’s handwriting. Is there a problem?” Miss Mirror asked, setting a note down on the table as
		she spoke.</p>

	<p>“Yes. Can I bring my subordinates with me?” Han Sen asked.</p>

	<p>“I suppose you can, but are you sure about taking them someplace dangerous?” Miss Mirror looked like she was
		smiling, but she wasn’t.</p>

	<p>Han Sen knew Miss Mirror was referring to Bao’er. She was warning Han Sen not to attempt an escape. He wouldn’t
		have a chance to.</p>

	<p>“If I can, I would like to bring Bao’er,” Han Sen said, pretending not to know what she meant.</p>

	<p>“Sure, but I have already told you; this place is dangerous. If something happens, don’t blame your auntie for
		not warning you,” Miss Mirror said.</p>

	<p>“I will be responsible for this decision,” Han Sen said tonelessly.</p>

	<p>“Good. Go and prepare. We will be leaving tonight.” With that, Miss Mirror turned and promptly left Underwater
		Town.</p>

	<p>Han Sen called for Bao’er. He left the Blood Kirin behind in Underwater Town to look after Lan Haixin, just in
		case she decided to stir up trouble.</p>

	<p>Han Sen wasn’t planning an escape. The Extreme King were too powerful. Unless he had a reliable backup plan, he
		wouldn’t flee. He couldn’t go back to Planet Eclipse, either. He didn’t want to drag Yisha into his problematic
		affairs.</p>

	<p>Han Sen wanted to bring Bao’er because he didn’t feel safe leaving her alone. Plus, he was used to having Bao’er
		around. Whenever he was alone, it always felt like he was missing something.</p>

	<p>He asked the Blood Kirin to watch Lan Haixin. Lilly begged Han Sen to take her with him, but he refused.</p>

	<p>Miss Mirror had said that the place was dangerous, and Han Sen didn’t think she told him that just to scare him.
		He was bringing Bao’er along because she could protect herself. Lilly was just a Duke. She would be unable to
		protect herself, and bringing her would be like handing her a death sentence.</p>

	<p>He brought Bao’er to the rally point, knowing that they wouldn’t be going alone. Many members of Spring Rain had
		already gathered. There were many Kings and half-deifieds, and Han Sen even saw two fully deified warriors
		amongst them.</p>

	<p>“What are they doing here?” Han Sen wondered. This was enough combat power to annihilate a higher race.</p>

	<p>When the ship started to move, Miss Mirror didn’t come looking for him. Han Sen had free time, so he practiced
		and consumed King class genes.</p>

	<p>Han Sen started trying to push Jadeskin’s self-universe cogwheel. He wanted to get Jadeskin up to King class.
		That progress would be much easier than leveling up the Dongxuan Sutra. It would only be a matter of time.</p>

	<p>The ship flew through many space teleportation points. When the ship arrived at their ultimate destination, Han
		Sen was shocked. He knew the place.</p>

	<p>“Isn’t this the xenogeneic space that Ning Yue mentioned?” Han Sen wondered.</p>
