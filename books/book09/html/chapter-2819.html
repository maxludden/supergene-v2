<h2>Cold Light Charm’s Beast Soul</h2>
<h3>Chapter 2819</h3>

<p>Beads of sweat cascaded down from Second Uncle’s brow. He had a
complicated expression as he wiped them away.</p>
<p>Han Sen exploded with a power that was greater than his own. It
was perhaps even better than Cold Light Charm. For such power to be
controlled by a small body like that was concerning. Second Uncle
feared Han Sen’s body might not be able to keep going. He worried
his body might blow up at any moment.</p>
<p>Second Uncle was someone who had a lot of knowledge. He had seen
many genius elites in his time but never a small body like that
blow up with so much potential. He had never seen another put on a
show like this before.</p>
<p>“Hasn’t he become exhausted and died yet? Does his body really
contain the genes of a true god creature?” Evil Lotus God’s eyes
were starting to flare with shock.</p>
<p>Aside from the child of a true god creature, ordinary creatures
were not able to display power this scary.</p>
<p>Pang!</p>
<p>Cold Light Charm’s transparent metal body was blown up by Han
Sen. With one final punch, its entire body was blown into fleshy
chunks.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Xenogeneic Deified Hunted. Cold Light Charm: Deified Xenogeneic
Gene Found. Obtained Cold Light Charm Beast Soul.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>At the same time, the announcement played in Han Sen’s head.</p>
<p>“It is dead! Long live Mister Holy Baby!” Londo screamed with
excitement. No one wanted to die. Han Sen had managed to blow up
the Cold Light Charm and save their lives. That is why they were so
happy.</p>
<p>“Not bad. That really wasn’t bad. To be able to do something
like that, you are impressive for the lowlife creature that you
are.” Evil Lotus was not angry. He clapped and smiled at Han
Sen.</p>
<p>“Evil Lotus, you can leave now. I will spare your life.” Han Sen
looked at Evil Lotus seriously as he spoke.</p>
<p>“Spare my life?” Evil Lotus God looked at him like an idiot.</p>
<p>Upon hearing Han Sen say that, Second Uncle, Meng Lie, Bao Ying,
and the others felt weird. Although they had pottery powder to
restrict the Evil Lotus God, making a god mad was never a wise
thing to do.</p>
<p>Evil Lotus God was not enraged. In fact, he did not even get the
slightest bit mad. No one cared for the crazy words of a fool, so
he was not going to be mad at a crazy guy.</p>
<p>Evil Lotus God looked at Han Sen as if he was in a high place
and said, “If you can survive against the xenogeneic siege that is
yet to come, I will kill you.”</p>
<p>The way he said his words were like it was Han Sen’s honor to
die by his hands.</p>
<p>Before Han Sen said anything in return, Ger was already
screaming and shouting, “Xenogeneics! It’s all xenogeneics! They
are all Cold Light Charms!”</p>
<p>Han Sen and the others looked back. In the distant sky, many
pink things, which looked like gems in the ocean, were coming for
them. All of them were Cold Light Charms.</p>
<p>Although they were not as scary as the terrifying first Cold
Light Charm, they were still deified class. Some of them were
almost as powerful as the first Cold Light Charm.</p>
<p>Everyone’s face suddenly turned white. Although they knew the
big barren systems were scary, they did not think it would be that
scary. Within thousands of miles, there were many scary
xenogeneics.</p>
<p>It had been hard for them to kill one Cold Light Charm, and this
group of Cold Light Charm presented them with 30 to 40 Cold Light
Charms. Some of them even had a power that was closer to the first
one. Being surrounded by that many Cold Light Charms, one could use
one’s ass to figure out what might happen next.</p>
<p>Han Sen had been exhausted once. He was not about to exhaust his
potential again. Even if he exhausted his potential again, he could
not take on 10 enemies alone.</p>
<p>Londo grabbed his big ax and shouted, “Fuck! Killing one was
enough. Killing two more is extra. We will fight until we die.”</p>
<p>Seeing the group of Cold Light Charms already arriving, everyone
knew they were not going to survive. They were all prepared to
die.</p>
<p>“Second Uncle, help me control those Cold Light Charms,” Han Sen
said. He then waved his right hand. A pink, half-transparent sword
appeared in his hand.</p>
<p>The sword looked like crystal. It was like a gem, but it was
cold like metal. It was only the width of a finger, and it was pink
like a crystal. The sword looked evil.</p>
<p>The handle of the sword had a pink, eye-like gem. It was like it
was looking at people. It gave people goosebumps when they saw
it.</p>
<p>[Deified beast soul Cold Light Charm: Cold Light Sword
(half-complete)]</p>
<p>This was different from the destroyed beast souls Han Sen had
received before. This Cold Light Sword beast soul was
half-complete. Han Sen had no idea what that meant, but he sensed
how scary the Cold Light Sword’s power was just by holding it.</p>
<p>Second Uncle had not time to react. Han Sen had already turned
into a light and was going into the Cold Light Charm group. He was
shocked. He subconsciously opened his time area and covered a large
portion of the land.</p>
<p>Now, it was the universe’s era with a lot of technology. Many
elites used swords, and there were many swordsmen in the Extreme
King.</p>
<p>Second Uncle and the others had never seen Han Sen’s sword
skill, nor the heard about them either.</p>
<p>Perhaps they did not notice which sword skills Han Sen used
because the weird red sword light that went across had already
enraptured their minds and eyesight.</p>
<p>The straight, pink, sword light went across space. It cut a Cold
Light Charm in half. Before anyone was able to react, Han Sen had
already rushed into the group of Cold Light Charms.</p>
<p>They saw the sword light go everywhere. It was like a deathly
cutting laser that was going across hell. Wherever it went, broken
tentacles flew everywhere. The Cold Light Charms were being
slaughtered by Han Sen as easy as if he was slicing vegetables.</p>
<p>Upon seeing all this, Londo and the others were frozen as he
said, “Holy crap! Mister Holy Baby is that strong? Was he toying
with us before?”</p>
<p>No one answered him because they were all in complete shock. It
would have been fine if the Cold Light Charms were that easy to
kill, but the Cold Light Charms there were as scary as the one
earlier. Yet, Han Sen was casually able to slice and dice their
limbs away. That group of Cold Light Charms was unable to do
anything to stop him.</p>
<p>Although Second Uncle’s time area helped how Han Sen go through
the Cold Light Charms carelessly, it was still too shocking.</p>
<p>Seeing all those powerful Cold Light Charms be slain by Han Sen,
god blood was bleeding like mad from the sky. The sword lights that
shocked the sky had become so outstanding in the chaos of the pink
beams of light.</p>
<p>Evil Lotus God was in utter shock as he watched Han Sen butcher
the Cold Light Charms. He looked confused. He was a god, but he had
never seen a xenogeneic perform like Han Sen. He was not able to
tell how strong he actually was either.</p>
<p>“What is wrong with that xenogeneic? What level is this
xenogeneic?” Evil Lotus God looked Han Sen up and down. His eyes
were gleaming with god lights. No matter how he looked at him, what
Han Sen was showing put him at transmutation class at the very
most. He was not larva class as he had expected.</p>
