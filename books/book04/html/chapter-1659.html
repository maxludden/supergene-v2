      Even Illusion Elder and the other three elders were in shock. They had
      used the Ancient Sky Mirror because it was a safe haven, but now they
      found themselves unable to escape from their refuge.
    </p>
    <p>
      Some super elites began to wish that they had never used the mirror at
      all.
    </p>
    <p>
      “You’ve only just now noticed?” Han Sen said with dark amusement. The red
      color continued to spread across the mirror.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a Real Blood invasion. Real Blood’s takeover always started out
      slow, but the more of the geno core Real Blood gained control over, the
      faster the process would go.
    </p>
    <p>Pang!</p>
    <p>
      The super elites wanted to escape, but they could only hit the bloody
      reflective surface. They couldn’t exit like they had earlier.
    </p>
    <p>
      All the creatures and spirits kept pounding the mirror, like a swarm of
      imprisoned monsters. They were terrified as they struck the glass wall
      that stood between them and freedom. They couldn’t get out.
    </p>
    <p>“*sshole! What did you do?” The few elders looked surprised.</p>
    <p>
      When the super creatures were killed，they’d end up locked inside the
      mirror. And as Han Sen watched them try to escape, it felt like he was
      watching a horde of rabid demons from hell.
    </p>
    <p>
      Han Sen was delighted that he had managed to take control of Ancient Sky
      Mirror, though. Not only could the object revive fallen comrades, but it
      could also trap others inside. Han Sen hadn’t expected the mirror to have
      such versatility.
    </p>
    <p>
      Real Blood gained full control of the mirror, and a connection was
      established directly between the captive mirror and Han Sen’s brain.
    </p>
    <p>
      The creatures and spirits all crowded to the front of the mirror in a
      frightened and angry mob. They kept pounding the bloody surface, Han Sen
      thought they looked like a horde of zombies trapped inside a container.
    </p>
    <p>
      Han Sen and Death Goddess proceeded to kill the remaining spirits and
      creatures that were outside the mirror. Once that was done, all their
      enemies were trapped inside the mirror.
    </p>
    <p>
      Han Sen then took control of the mirror, forcing it to rise up slowly into
      the sky.
    </p>
    <p>
      Rocks broke and tumbled away from the base of the mirror as it rose, and
      cracks shot across the length of the valley. “Impossible! How can the
      mirror be controlled!? Impossible!” The beings in the mirror were all so
      shocked.
    </p>
    <p>
      The mirror’s power was special, so finding someone else of the same
      element to control it was thought to be impossible.
    </p>
    <p>
      They had been happy to add their reflections to the mirror. It did not
      matter if they were injured or killed; they could come back. In many ways,
      they were invincible.
    </p>
    <p>
      But they knew the implications of the mirror being under someone’s
      control. If someone gained possession of the mirror, that person would
      control all the reflections that the mirror held.
    </p>
    <p>
      They really didn’t want to believe that Han Sen had asserted control over
      the thing. Unfortunately, it was an undeniable truth.
    </p>
    <p>Katcha!</p>
    <p>
      Ancient Sky Mirror tore its way up out of the ground. The place where the
      mirror had rested was now seeping blood like a red fountain.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was like a spring of infinite power. Han Sen realized now that the
      mirror was using that as a source of constant energy. It was how it kept
      on reviving the elites who had died.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Skysword! This grudge seems to reside between you and Illusion only; let
      us go. If you touch the rest of us, that means you will be going up
      against the rest of the Fourth God’s Sanctuary!” one of the elites yelled.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Yeah! This has nothing to do with us. Let us go or Yin Demon will come
      after you.”
    </p>
    <p>“The Manlong are heroes. If you kill me, they’ll kill you.”</p>
    <p>“I, Longmei…”</p>
    <p>
      Goddess was inside there, as well. She was in shock, and she shouted, “Han
      Sen, if you let us go, Sacred will forgive the grudge it has with you!”
    </p>
    <p>
      Han Sen did not care, though. All he did was stare at them, letting them
      yell in anger, sadness, and desperation. Whatever their expression, Han
      Sen did not care.
    </p>
    <p>
      The mirror slowly flew to Han Sen, and as it did, it became smaller. When
      it reached his hand, it was only around the size of his palm. He was
      easily able to grab it.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Skysword, if you touch us, you will die!” Illusion Elder roared, but he
      was obviously trying to suppress his fear.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Die!” Han Sen used his mind to blow up Illusion Elder’s body. The mirror
      was dyed red once more.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Berserk Super Creature Illusion Beast killed. No beast soul gained. Geno
      core destroyed. The flesh has been destroyed. The Life Geno Essence is
      missing.”
    </p>
    <p>
      Han Sen was surprised. This was the first he had never received a Life
      Geno Essence.
    </p>
    <p>
      After watching Illusion Elder’s sudden demise, everyone became angry and
      shocked. The rest of Illusion went mad. Han Sen used his mind to kill all
      the yelling monsters. And seeing that, none of the others dared to speak
      now. They were all in shock.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the creatures that were killed inside the mirror did not leave
      anything behind. He noticed there really weren’t any Life Geno Essences
      being made available.
    </p>
    <p>
      They had Life Geno Essences, but the mirror absorbed them. They made the
      mirror stronger.
    </p>
    <p>
      Han Sen took the mirror and went to sit on Little Star’s back. He wanted
      to leave the valley. Death Goddess came to sit down on it, too. She did so
      naturally, as if it was something she was used to doing.
    </p>
    <p>
      Han Sen felt as if he had a bit of a headache. But since Han Sen couldn’t
      undo what had happened, and she seemed to consider him family, he was
      willing to take her back.
    </p>
    <p>
      News of the fight spread across all of the Fourth God’s Sanctuary. The
      stories of the fight seemed impossible, but many spirits and creatures had
      come to watch the attack on Death Goddess. There were too many witnesses
      for the stories to all be lies.
    </p>
    <p>
      Han Sen and Death Goddess killed the elites of many tribes, and he had
      even taken the mirror. News of this was everywhere, on the tip of every
      tongue in the Fourth God’s Sanctuary.
    </p>
    <p>
      The most shocking news was that Death Goddess was Skysword’s daughter. It
      was difficult to believe, but Death Goddess had said it herself. It was
      rather surprising.
    </p>
    <p>
      And as they were all shocked, many were also angry. A storm was brewing.
    </p>
    <p>
      Han Sen knew things wouldn’t be resolved quickly if he was willing to let
      the creatures and spirits he had collected go.
    </p>
    <p>
      And of course, Han Sen was not going to do that So, when he returned, he
      prepared for a fight.
    </p>
    <p>
      Before, Han Sen might have been scared at the prospect of taking on the
      whole sanctuary. After all, it was hard to fight with fists. No matter how
      strong he was, people would be affected.
    </p>
    <p>
      But with Ancient Sky Mirror, things were now very different Han Sen did
      not have to be afraid.
