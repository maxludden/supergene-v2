<h2>A Dark Place</h2>
<h3>Chapter 2930</h3>

<p>The long, bright lanterns only led in a singular direction. They
had been traveling all that time but had yet to see hide nor hair
of Nine Thousand King or Moon Shadow God. It meant they had to have
gone that way.</p>
<p>“Moon Shadow God was the wife of Crow Sky Dog,” Ancient Abyss
Grandmaster said. “She must know quite a few of Sacred’s secrets.
It is not surprising that she was able to go through this.”</p>
<p>“If they were able to through this way, there is no reason why
we cannot do the same,” Yang Yun Sheng said. “We should just push
on and brute force our way through.”</p>
<p>“I agree,” Ancient Abyss Grandmaster said. “Forcing our way
forward is the only way, but we should ensure we are prepared.” He
waved his sleeves and took out a white umbrella that looked like a
jade bone.</p>
<p>Ancient Abyss Grandmaster opened the umbrella. The umbrella
started to drop white holy light. It covered approximately 30 feet
of the area around them.</p>
<p>“This is called Shining Umbrella,” Ancient Abyss Grandmaster
said. “It has light bai sema power. Perhaps it will work against
the pervasive dark. Why don’t you guys come with us under the
umbrella?” He looked at the big and small goldfish and said, “These
two goldfish are two big. The Shining Umbrella won’t cover them.
Why don’t we just leave them here and go on ahead?”</p>
<p>“Thank you for your good intention, Grandmaster. Since I brought
them this far, I cannot just leave them behind. Grandmaster, you
can go on ahead. I will search for another way through this mess.”
Han Sen was not willing to let go of the goldfish family just
yet.</p>
<p>It was not like Han Sen had a strong bond with them. It was
because they were creatures that belonged to Sacred. They likely
knew more about Sacred than anyone else present.</p>
<p>Ancient Abyss Grandmaster tried to convince him. Han Sen kept
insisting on bringing the goldfish family, so there was nothing
else he could say. He raised the Shining Umbrella and went into the
darkness with Yang Yun Sheng and the others.</p>
<p>Han Sen saw the Shining Umbrella’s bai sema keep colliding with
the darkness. The light of the umbrella was fairly suppressed.
There were only six more feet of the radius left for them. Ancient
Abyss Grandmaster and the others were all squeezed together. It
barely kept them all protected on the inside.</p>
<p>The bai sema kept quivering in the dark like it was going to
fall apart at any second. It was unknown whether or not they would
make it through to reach the next long, bright lantern.</p>
<p>The distance between the two bright lanterns was 60 to 90 feet.
After Ancient Abyss Grandmaster and the others walked a few steps
into the dark, they were gone. It was like they had been consumed
by the darkness.</p>
<p>Han Sen looked at the other side with the next bright lantern.
As he gazed upon it, he likened it to a firefly. Yet, he was not
able to see what was under the lantern.</p>
<p>“Ancient Abyss Grandmaster and the others barely attempted it.
They just walked into the dark. They were clearly prepared for
this. How can I get the goldfish through it though?” Han Sen was
not going to be like Ancient Abyss Grandmaster and just make use of
a treasure to walk right in.</p>
<p>Han Sen hesitated a moment before he brought out his Cold Light
Sword. He walked in front of the darkness and slashed out some pink
sword lights through the darkness.</p>
<p>The sword lights ran out into the darkness, but they vanished
within a second. They did not create anything. There was no
reaction.</p>
<p>Han Sen frowned. He slowly put the Cold Light Sword’s tip into
the darkness. The sword barely touched the darkness. Han Sen felt
the tip of the Cold Light Sword being twisted by some sort of
power. He almost lost his grip on the blade.</p>
<p>Han Sen quickly removed the Cold Light Sword from the dark. The
Cold Light Sword’s sword light had a few cracks in it.</p>
<p>“That is very scary darkness.” Han Sen gasped. He was shocked
that the Cold Light Sword, which was almost as good as a true god
weapon, had been affected like that. If that dark power was applied
to his body, it was difficult to imagine what might happen.</p>
<p>Han Sen was a bit annoyed. He did not know how to get through
the dark zone. Bao’er, who was on his shoulder, asked, “Dad, didn’t
you get a stone lantern before? Can you light up this place with
that?”</p>
<p>“I can try to.” Han Sen had already been thinking about making
use of the stone lantern, but the stone lantern’s lantern flame was
different from the flame that adorned the long, bright lanterns
around. He did not know if it would work, but he resolved to give
it a go.</p>
<p>Han Sen took the stone lantern out of Destiny’s Tower. The stone
lantern was the same as before. The flame was about the size of a
thumb. It was not very bright.</p>
<p>Holding the stone lantern, Han Sen tip-toed closer to the
darkness. Where the light shone, the darkness melted and fell back.
It carved out a lit area.</p>
<p>“It really does work!” Han Sen was extremely happy. He held the
stone lantern and kept moving forward. Large amounts of darkness
were chased away.</p>
<p>The stone lantern did not look very bright, but in the dark, it
was able to light up an area that was several dozen feet wide. In
the radius of the stone lantern, the universal cogwheels returned
to normal. They did not break again.</p>
<p>“It looks like this stone lantern is better than these long,
light lanterns. I do not know what this stone lantern is, but it is
very weird.” Han Sen stroked the stone lantern hard. He really
loved it.</p>
<p>A significant portion of the zone was lit up. It was not
difficult to bring the goldfish family through with him. Han Sen
held Bao’er and sat atop the big goldfish’s back. He enabled the
big goldfish to lead them. Han Sen held the stone lantern to keep
the area bright.</p>
<p>The big goldfish’s rabid powers did not advance any further, but
the fish had not recovered either. It still seemed as if it had
some clarity even though its reaction was a bit slow.</p>
<p>Fortunately, the fish was still able to understand Han Sen’s
words. It kept following Han Sen’s direction. The small goldfish
followed next to them. It seemed to be scared while venturing
through the dark.</p>
<p>While they were traveling, Han Sen thought he heard a woman
wailing in the dark. It was a sorrowful sound, and it seemed rather
close to them.</p>
<p>The crying voice was more than spooky. It was very sad as it
rang out from the silence. It made people feel a chill.</p>
<p>“Dad, it looks like someone is crying,” Bao said while looking
into the dark area.</p>
<p>“It does not matter. Just ignore it.” Han Sen continued to hold
the lantern. He made the big goldfish carry on toward the next
long, light lantern. The lantern was not too far away. It was just
120 to 150 feet away, but they had been traveling a few hundred
miles. They had yet to reach the long, bright lantern.</p>
<p>Han Sen thought, “Sacred is so weird. When I walked past the
long, bright lantern, both of the distances seemed 90 to 120 feet
apart from each other. Even if there was a long, bright lantern
missing, it would only be 210 to 240 feet away. Now, we have walked
a few hundred miles and have yet to reach the next lantern.
Clearly, there is some problem with the space in this area.”</p>
<p>The darkness around was suddenly filled with a countless number
of sharp blades. They were headed for Han Sen from every angle.</p>
<p>“Moon Shadow God!” Han Sen recognized who the black blades
belonged to.</p>
<p>“I will make you pay for my son’s death.” Moon Shadow God’s
angry voice sounded out from the dark. She was able to travel
through the darkness, and she seemed to be able to control it.</p>
