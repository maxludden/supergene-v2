<p>Han Sen flew above the small section of clear water, and he tried to see whether there was any difference in the water. That section of the lake looked like a well. It was clear from top to bottom, yet all the water around it was dark. The dark water and the clear water didn’t integrate at all.</p>

<p>However, it was already after sunset, and the water was very deep, so even if they looked directly down on the clear water, they could only see darkness. They had no idea how deep it was.</p>

<p>Unlike the dark lake around it, there were bubbles coming up through the clear water, as if there were lots of fish below.</p>

<p>“Teacher, what’s wrong with the water here?” Xu Mi asked Han Sen, standing beside him.</p>

<p>Han Sen thought, “How should I know anything about it? I’m not a god who knows everything.”</p>

<p>Of course, Han Sen didn’t say that out loud. He smiled at Xu Mi and said, “Just wait here for now. I’ll go down there and check. Don’t enter the water until I come out.”</p>

<p>Han Sen jumped into the clear water with Bao’er, diving deep.</p>

<p>He had practiced his swimming skills before. Though he couldn’t compare with real marine creatures, he was still able to engage in ordinary fights.</p>

<p>Han Sen was cautious. As he swam down, he summoned his golden engraving shield and held it in front of himself to defend against ferocious creatures.</p>

<p>The lake was surprisingly deep. Han Sen had dived more than three thousand feet, yet he still couldn’t see the bottom. Everything around him was still dark, and the water looked like ink.</p>

<p>Han Sen kept diving, and as he swam down, he suddenly felt a hollow sensation below him, and then he fell forward.</p>

<p>As Han Sen quickly regained his feet, he found out that he was standing in a huge underground cave. There were many bones scattered around the cave, and there was a strong stench in the air.</p>

<p>In the middle of the cave was a black spring, and it was spewing water like gas. Two creatures lay beside the mouth of the well.</p>

<p>The one on the left looked like a dragon, and its scales gleamed with black light as if they were made of coal. The dragon teeth in its mouth looked like knives.</p>

<p>It was around eighty feet long, and it looked belligerent.</p>

<p>The creature on the right was a giant white wolf, and it was just as large as the black dragon beside it. Its fur was white as snow, yet its eyes were black like ink. Ripples and distortions in space itself seemed to waver through the wolf’s fur.</p>

<p>The two ferocious beasts glared at Han Sen at the same time, looking at him like a piece of fresh meat that had just been dropped on their doorstep.</p>

<p>“Destroyer Wolf?” Han Sen was startled. He was originally looking for the trail of the creature he had sensed on the shoreline, but he hadn’t expected to find the Destroyer Wolf here.</p>

<p>Gu Qingcheng described the appearance of the destroyer wolf to Han Sen before, and this giant white wolf looked just as she had described it. And with that terrifying force coming from it, it had to be the Destroyer Wolf.</p>

<p>As for the black dragon, it was likely to be the legendary Rolling Dragon. However, neither of them seemed to be the creature Han Sen was looking for.</p>

<p>Aside from the Rolling Dragon and the Destroyer Wolf, there weren’t any other creatures in the entire underground cave. Inside the black spring, an object about the size of a basketball was rolling around.</p>

<p>Before Han Sen could see what that object exactly was, he heard the Rolling Dragon roar, after which it spewed a stream of black light toward him.</p>

<p>Han Sen couldn’t see clearly what that black light was, so he couldn’t even dodge it. He raised the golden engraving shield to ward it off.</p>

<p>Dang!</p>

<p>Han Sen felt a giant force transmitting through the golden engraving shield, and he couldn’t help stepping back, his back running into a rock wall in the cave.</p>

<p>The rock was so hard that it only had some faint cracks after being hit by Han Sen’s body, yet Han Sen’s bones were almost dislocated.</p>

<p>That stream of black light also bounced back after hitting the golden engraving shield. The black light shot toward the Rolling Dragon and splashed over its tail. Rather than being injured by the power, the dragon’s tail caught the black light.</p>

<p>Han Sen then saw clearly that the black light shot by the Rolling Dragon was a trident, which was as dark as ink. There were dragon engravings on the handle, and three dragon heads formed the top of the trident.</p>

<p>The strike from the Rolling Dragon didn’t kill Han Sen, which shocked it a little bit. The Destroyer Wolf stared at Han Sen and said, “Who sent you here? Sacred shelter or Outer Sky shelter?”</p>

<p>“Nobody sent me. I came here myself.” Lots of thoughts flooded into Han Sen’s mind.</p>

<p>The Rolling Dragon and the Destroyer Wolf didn’t seem to be enemies, and besides, both the creatures were emanating horrifying lifeforces. They were both incredibly powerful beings.</p>

<p>Han Sen’s power hadn’t reached super level yet, so he wasn’t sure whether he could fight against two beings at that level.</p>

<p>“I should’ve brought Gu Qingcheng with me.” Han Sen sighed. He hadn’t expected to find the Destroyer Wolf so easily.</p>

<p>Han Sen had thought that the Destroyer Wolf would team up with the Rolling Dragon to fight him. Instead, the Destroyer Wolf squinted its eyes and gazed at Han Sen for a while, then made a surprising suggestion.</p>

<p>“Since you weren’t sent by Sacred, and you’re all by yourself, why don’t you stay here and share the Sacred egg with us?”</p>

<p>“How could I do that?” Han Sen found it hard to believe that the Destroyer Wolf would be so kind. It had risked everything to steal that egg. Why would it share with some random human?</p>

<p>The Destroyer Wolf smiled, yet that smile kind of creeped Han Sen out. A smile from a giant wolf was a truly disturbing thing to see.</p>

<p>“Let me put it this way,” the Destroyer Wolf said, sounding sincere. “We don’t want to share the Sacred egg with others. From my perspective, you’re pretty powerful, and it won’t be easy for us to kill you. If you flee and attract other powerful creatures here, it’ll be a huge problem for us both. If you’re willing, the three of us can share this egg. What do you think?”</p>

<p>Though what the Destroyer Wolf said made perfect sense to Han Sen, he still felt something off.</p>

<p>However, Han Sen was certain of one thing: if he refused, the two creatures would immediately team up and try to kill him to protect their secret.</p>

<p>“Okay. Since you’re this sincere, I’ll go along with it.” Han Sen thought to himself, “I’ll just use my Destiny’s Tower if you really want to attack me. Perhaps I can even find a chance to get that egg.”</p>

<p>“Then you can come down now, my friend. The Sacred egg is ready for eating. Is there anyone else aside from you who knows that we’re here?” asked the Destroyer Wolf, smiling.</p>

<p>“No.” Han Sen moved down towards them slowly. However, he kept his distance from them. He looked at the white object within the black well and asked, “Is that the Sacred egg?”</p>
