<h2>Punching Four Guards</h2>
<h3>Chapter 2363</h3>

<p>“He’s asking to be humiliated. Take him down,” Prince Swordstar
growled.</p>
<p>“Bai Yi is getting crazier and crazier. He was lucky to get the
alpha statue and earn the protection of the Kingese, but it’s gone
to his head. He’s become arrogant and blind to who he really is,”
Prince Nineteen said coldly.</p>
<p>Bai Ling Shuang was near. She frowned, thinking that Bai Yi’s
behavior was far too reckless.</p>
<p>When Han Sen earned the protection of the Kingese, Bai Ling
Shuang wondered if she should stay close to him, or perhaps even
ally with him. But now that Bai Yi had just become a tiny bit
successful, his arrogance had become overwhelming. The thought of
joining up with him was severely reduced now.</p>
<p>She wasn’t afraid of god-like enemies, but she was afraid of
teaming up with someone who was gluttonous and uncontrollable. Bai
Yi’s anger and recklessness would most likely cause her a lot of
trouble. Bai Ling Shuang had her doubts about him before, but now
he was confirming her suspicions.</p>
<p>Han Sen wasn’t concerned about what anyone thought of him,
though. He was copying Bai Yi’s personality and trying to act as
the bitter prince would have.</p>
<p>Plus, he didn’t like Prince Swordstar. This was the perfect
excuse for him to teach the brat a lesson.</p>
<p>When Han Sen prepared his Extreme King Shocking Sky Punch, the
four guards gathered to defend Prince Swordstar. The four powerful
enemies had to give up on the idea of attacking the blood kirin to
deal with Han Sen’s punch, first and foremost.</p>
<p>But they didn’t dare to actually kill Han Sen. They just wanted
to put him in his place.</p>
<p>Killing was a crime in King’s Garden, but if they killed the
blood kirin, they’d be locked up but not sentenced to death. Prince
Swordstar’s uncle was the captain of the Sentencing Court, after
all.</p>
<p>The consequences of killing Bai Yi, on the other hand, would be
quite lethal.</p>
<p>Han Sen didn’t seem concerned about the situation. He used his
Shocking Sky Punch at max power, and his punch combined with the
water skills he had learned from watching Ancient Water God. He
modified the Shocking Sky Punch to accommodate the new ability.</p>
<p>When he cast it, the punch was like a Shocking Sky Big Wave. A
wave was unleashed, and then another wave. The waves continued to
roll out, growing in power as they came. He could fight four people
with this, and the four guards were suddenly at a large
disadvantage.</p>
<p>The two half-deified guards didn’t dare to fight. They were
afraid of killing Prince Sixteen, but a few punches later, their
eyes widened.</p>
<p>The four guards weren’t the only ones who were shocked. Prince
Swordstar, Bai Ling Shuang, Prince Nineteen, and other royal
children stood and watched with mouths agape.</p>
<p>Han Sen stood like a king that ruled the entire universe. His
punches were heavier than the sea, and they crushed the stars. The
four guards fell backward with screams that rocked the skies. Their
knives, swords, spears, and punching lights were exploding. But
even so, they could not break down Han Sen’s punches.</p>
<p>Under those punches that were like a dragon from the sea, even
half-deified guards were unable to keep their heads above water.
They were like boats navigating a sea of treacherous waves. It was
incomparable to the sky and ground powers that they knew.</p>
<p>“Old Sixteen has practiced Shocking Sky Punch to this degree?”
Prince Nineteen couldn’t believe his eyes.</p>
<p>Bai Ling Shuang was shocked, too. Other members of the Extreme
King could use a stronger version of Shocking Sky Punch, but they
had developed the ability to the eighth or nine-tier. The fact that
Han Sen could use such a strong Shocking Sky Punch at the
first-tier was mind-blowing. Not even a half-deified royal child
could do what he was doing.</p>
<p>Han Sen practiced the most basic Shocking Sky Punch, and other
royal children had practiced the more advanced versions. Bai Wei
had practiced the Extreme King Final Punch. Its power should have
been much greater than the basic version of the skill.</p>
<p>Han Sen was using the Shocking Sky Punch, but it had been fused
with Water Will. It was an upgraded version of the skill, a
modification that Han Sen had engineered himself. That was why Bai
Ling Shuang was so shocked.</p>
<p>Tailoring the Shocking Sky Punch into the exact skill he needed
wasn’t a feat that a simple-minded person could perform.</p>
<p>Bai Ling Shuang looked at Han Sen, who was suppressing four
guards like they were dogs, and felt a flurry of mixed
emotions.</p>
<p>Prince Swordstar gritted his teeth. He was young, so he had
relied on his mother’s power. He was fairly well-known amongst the
royal children, and having a prince like Bai Yi suppress all four
of his guards was unacceptable.</p>
<p>It would have been okay if Han Sen was half-deified and the
guards were from a smaller race, but that was not the case. Prince
Swordstar’s guards hailed from big factions of the Extreme King.
The two half-deified guards were of mixed heritage, but they had
Extreme King blood in their veins. They still possessed the power
of a half-deified Extreme King. They shouldn’t lose against Prince
Sixteen.</p>
<p>But now, the two half-deified guards and the two ninth-tier
Kings were fighting Han Sen. And they were suppressed and unable to
push him back. Prince Swordstar knew he wouldn’t be able to do
anything, either. It made him feel as if a snake had sunk its fangs
into his heart. His face darkened, twisting with hate.</p>
<p>“I didn’t know Brother Sixteen possessed such a power. How
surprising,” said a man sitting on a king dragon’s head. He was
clad in a gold robe, and his voice was hard.</p>
<p>There was a green-armored man sitting next to the gold-robed
man. He said, “I cannot even tell if he truly is Old Sixteen. Why
are you referring to him as if he is important, crown prince?”</p>
<p>“Brother Four, you are wrong. If Father accepts him, then that
means he is Brother Sixteen,” the crown prince said.</p>
<p>Prince Four chuckled. “I don’t think so. We both know what Old
Sixteen was like. Since when has he been this smart? He’s fighting
four people at once with a punching skill, and he’s playing them
like a fiddle. That isn’t something Old Sixteen could do. He was
stupid.”</p>
<p>The crown prince squinted as he looked at Han Sen. “Who knows?
We cannot tell. Perhaps we have underestimated him.”</p>
<p>Prince Four didn’t reply. He grunted and stared at Han Sen, who
shone with the glory of both a god and a demon.</p>
<p>Pang!</p>
<p>Han Sen punched and struck a half-deified guard. The Shocking
Sky Punch had been cast many times, and its power had grown by many
multiples. Even a half-deified elite couldn’t withstand those
blows. Han Sen punched an enemy’s chestplate and caved it in. Blood
sprayed from the half-deified guard’s lips.</p>
<p>No hesitation. The next second, Han Sen’s fist was coming down
toward the guard’s head like a falling star. The scary power was
like a river descending from the sky.</p>
<p>“Bai Yi! You killed my guard! I will kill you!” Prince Swordstar
screamed, his eyes turning red.</p>
<p>“I didn’t dare,” Han Sen said simply. The scary Shocking Sky
Punch landed on the half-deified guard.</p>
