There was no Evil God Beard inside the hole, so there was no longer a need to worry about anything.

Han Sen played dead, but he felt like something was stepping on his head. He then heard the squeaking noise again. It came from the little white rat.

After the sound rang out, Han Sen felt his legs loosen. He was freed. He stopped hesitating and went into the hole.

The little white rat leaped off his head. Its four claws were waving, and its small butt was wiggling as it proceeded onward.

Han Sen followed the small white rat. The hole was a very complicated place. It was like it had been dug through by animals. It was nothing man-made.

Suddenly, the small white rat had no shadow. It was like it had just vanished.

While Han Sen wondered where the small white rat was, his body sank. He fell.

Patong!

Han Sen felt his bum get spiked by something sharp. It hurt him so much that he had to leap away. It was then that he discovered he was in a room built with copper. There were many bones and skeletons strewn around it.

He saw a sharp bone where he had landed. The bone was sticking up his anus.

Han Sen pulled out the bone from his butt and threw it on the floor. He saw the small white rat scurry around the walls of the copper room. It was unknown what it was up to.

Han Sen looked around the room. There were no doors. There was just a hole in the ceiling. Looking at the hole, one could see there was water beyond it. That was where Han Sen had come from.

Inside the hole he had traversed, he was led to a place where there was just a pile of bones and nothing else.

Han Sen looked at the bones and said to himself, “By looking at these bones, it is safe to say they aren’t the bones of humans. They likely belong to a beast with four legs. This cannot be the skeleton of the God Chaos Party’s old leader. Who had the misfortune to die here?”

Han Sen picked up a bone and pushed away all the others. He wanted to see if he could do something.

After digging for a while, Han Sen heard a “dong” sound. It sounded metallic. It did not sound like he was hitting a bone.

Han Sen kept on digging. He eventually found something metallic beneath the bones. It was red in color. It was like a rusty steel stick.

Han Sen pulled out the rusty steel stick and noticed it wasn’t a steel stick. It was a scabbard that was made from steel. It had been there for so long that it had rusted over. It was like a red kind of rust. There was a lot of it. The scabbard was caked to the point that he could not tell what it looked like before.

The scabbard, however, was very heavy. Han Sen used the scabbard like a stick and kept digging through the mound of bones. He was unable to find anything more.

“Why is there a scabbard amidst the bones? What or who do all these other bones belong to?” While Han Sen wondered about this mystery, he heard more squeaking.

Han Sen turned around and saw the little white rat in the corner of the room. It kept squeaking while gnawing at something. Its tiny butt kept twisting and turning.

Han Sen walked up to the small rat. He noticed it was using its teeth to gnaw a copper pillar in the corner of the palace. That pillar had a hole in it that was the size of an apple. The small white rat continued to bite it.

When the small white rat burrowed through the hole, Han Sen noticed that the copper pillar was hollow. After the small white rat dug through it, a purple and black liquid began to seep out. It was like the oil stains people had left for years across an old stove.

Han Sen smelled something nasty. It was clearly coming from that black and purple liquid. The small white rat did not seem as if it was able to repel the horrible smell either. The little creature stopped gnawing the copper pillar and started falling back. It went back and stared at the hole it had managed to dig with its teeth.

A revolting, pungent smell was still coming from out of the hole. Han Sen covered his nose and looked at it. He felt as if he could tell what it was.

“Is this liquid the substances a dead body releases?” Han Sen looked at the purple and black liquid and felt confident that had to be it.

To use an Alliance saying, the liquid a body released was often called dead body oil.

Han Sen did not know what creature might release such dead body oils, and he had no idea why something would have died inside a copper pillar. There was, however, one thing he knew for sure. He knew that the place he was in was very dangerous.

Donglong!

Following that liquid, something else emerged. It was stuck inside the wall between the copper pillar and could not come out.

Han Sen picked up a bone and stabbed it through the hole. Not long later, something came out from the hole with the stinky liquid.

Han Sen picked the item up from the black and purple liquid. Before he could see what it was, an announcement played in his head. “Found Break World gene.”

“It is a Break World gene? That means the creature that died inside this copper pillar was a Break World beast.” Han Sen was shocked. He picked up the item and wiped it clean. He saw a crystal jade Break World gene that looked like a teardrop.

Han Sen kept stabbing into the hole with the bone. He repeatedly thrust. He let all of the purple and black fluid flow out until nothing else remained.

When the liquid stopped coming out, the little white rat moved forward. It went to the gnawed-out hole and went inside.

“Big Brother, you might be able to weasel your way inside, but I know I can’t.” Han Sen looked at the hole, which was only the size of a fist, and felt a bit depressed.

Han Sen thought the small white rat could not hear him, but the small white rat’s head poked out really quickly. It used its big eyes to look at him. Suddenly, two beams of light landed on Han Sen.

In the next second, Han Sen felt as if the hole was getting bigger. Not long later, it became a hole that was the size of a man.

When Han Sen looked around him, he noticed everything in the copper room was bigger. Han Sen quickly realized that the hole hadn’t become bigger. It was the beams of the small white rat that had made him smaller. That really surprised him.

The little white rat crawled into the hole. This time, Han Sen stopped talking crap. He followed after the small white rat. The copper pillar was very smelly. Han Sen had to hold his nose as he followed the small white rat.

There were a few screw-shaped circles inside the copper pillar. A man and a rat climbed across this screw-shaped road. Han Sen was forced to touch a lot of the purple and black liquid.

When they climbed to the top of the copper pillar, Han Sen noticed the copper room, copper pillar, and the items of the copper screws were all able to be passed through. They created a network that could lead anywhere. He wasn’t sure where it could lead them.
