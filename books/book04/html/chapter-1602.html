<p>Han Sen rushed forward and caught Bao’er. She felt cold.</p>

<p>Bao’er’s soft body became hard like a piece of wood. Not only did she feel different now, but her body began to actually turn into wood, and she looked like a doll made of wood.</p>

<p>“Bao’er!” Han Sen was extremely worried. He yelled twice, but he couldn’t get an answer from Bao’er. The green light coming from her body was getting stronger and stronger, and her body was becoming harder and harder. Bao’er’s lifeforce was also plummeting.</p>

<p>Han Sen was really flustered. Bao’er had stayed with him for too long, and he was too used to having her with him. Even his own son Little flower hadn’t been with Han Sen as long as Bao’er. She was just like a daughter to Han Sen now.</p>

<p>Now, there was something wrong with Bao’er. Even someone with a strong will like Han Sen was worried.</p>

<p>Little Silver realized what had happened. It hit Bao’er with a streak of silver lightning. The lightning flowed into Bao’er’s body like mercury, which made her livelier.</p>

<p>However, she only recovered a little bit, and then her lifeforce started to decline again.</p>

<p>“Save her, Little Silver!” Han Sen shouted at Little Silver beside him.</p>

<p>Little Silver had already run over to Bao’er. It used its lightning with all its power, and it became its true body, the Ten-Tailed Lightning Fox. The Ten-Tailed Lightning Fox was shaking, and it hit Bao’er with powerful blasts of silver lightning. However, the incredible healing power could only slow down the rate at which her lifeforce declined.</p>

<p>Han Sen also simulated Little Silver’s lightning power and hit Bao’er with it as well, but the power he simulated was far weaker than Little Silver’s, so it didn’t work quite as well. It was still better than not helping.</p>

<p>Even so, Bao’er’s lifeforce was still declining. After only half an hour, Bao’er’s lifeforce was so feeble that it seemed like it could vanish at any time.</p>

<p>Little Silver looked strange. It took a look at the anxious Han Sen. The creature seemed to make up its mind about something. It spewed out a crystal ball that was surrounded by silver lightning.</p>

<p>The lightning crystal ball flew toward Bao’er after Little Silver spat it out. It fell on Bao’er’s forehead, and forces of lightning power rushed out like threads, penetrating Bao’er’s body.</p>

<p>After the lightning crystal ball showed up, Little Silver stopped being a Ten-Tailed Lightning Fox, and it looked burned out.</p>

<p>Lightning power rushed out of the lightning crystal ball, which saved Bao’er’s life. However, as the lightning left the crystal ball, the crystal ball became smaller and smaller. It seemed that the power in the lightning crystal ball was not recyclable.</p>

<p>The crystal ball kept shrinking, from the size of a fist to the size of an egg to the size of a table tennis ball, and finally, it was only the size of a fingernail. The green light covering Bao’er finally disappeared.</p>

<p>Bao’er’s stiff body started to recover, and after a short while, her body became soft again. It seemed that she had a very nice sleep, and she stretched her body.</p>

<p>“Stop eating random things! Otherwise, I won’t take you out anymore.” Han Sen checked Bao’er’s body, and after making sure that she had recovered, he scolded her.</p>

<p>Bao’er had her head lowered and didn’t dare to say anything. Han Sen stopped talking to her and walked to Little Silver. He stroked Little Silver’s head. It seemed that the lightning crystal ball was very important to Little Silver, and the crystal ball was tiny by the time Little Silver retrieved it. Han Sen felt that Little Silver’s lifeforce had plummeted, and it was almost at the same level as one of the sand mice.</p>

<p>Han Sen felt horrible as he held the weak Little Silver in his arms. Little Silver had followed him longer than Bao’er, so Han Sen valued it just as much as he valued Bao’er.</p>

<p>Fortunately, both Bao’er and Little Silver were safe. Han Sen couldn’t deal with losing either of them.</p>

<p>Lin Feng and the others were also relieved seeing that Bao’er and Little Silver were safe.</p>

<p>Jing Jiwu looked at the only remaining fruit on the tree and said, “I understand now. The fruit on the tree might have the power of the five elements: gold, wood, water, fire, and earth. Sand mice are of the earth element, so that king of mice must’ve eaten a fruit of the mud element, so it was lucky enough to escape death. Even more luckily, it evolved. As for the sand mouse just now, it ate a metal-element fruit, which didn’t match its own element, so it turned into metal. As for Bao’er, she ate a fruit of the wood element, and as for the remaining fruit, it should be a fire element. If those fruits really correspond to the five elements, the other two fruit might’ve been eaten already, perhaps by the person who left the writing on the tree.”</p>

<p>It does make perfect sense. Lin Feng agreed with what Jing Ji Wu said completely.</p>

<p>If the remaining one is of the fire element, then it’s only useful for those of the fire element. Is there any one of us who meets that qualification?</p>

<p>Everyone looked at each other. The Dragon Chef said, “If no one is going to touch it, then I’ll get the last fruit”</p>

<p>“Are you of the fire element?” Han Sen didn’t know which element the Dragon Chef belonged to, but based on her ability, she definitely used fire, so it was highly likely.</p>

<p>The Dragon Chef nodded her head, then shook her head again. “Not entirely, but I won’t eat it myself. If what Jing Jiwu said is true, this fruit is a super ingredient. I’ll try to cook it, and if I succeed, perhaps I can achieve super level.”</p>

<p>Han Sen didn’t raise any objections to that.</p>

<p>The Dragon Chef didn’t need the food she cooked. The one thing she needed was the process of cooking, and if she could actually succeed, she would give the food to others.</p>

<p>Lin Feng and the others didn’t raise any objections either. None of them were of the fire element, and besides, they arrived here because of Han Sen’s help, so none of them wanted a share of the fruit</p>

<p>The Dragon Chef saw that nobody raised any objections, so she summoned a knife and a pot She cut the red fruit and the remaining half of the yellow fruit, putting them in the pot</p>

<p>“I’ll share with you guys after I cook it successfully”, said the Dragon Chef, excited.</p>

<p>None of the sand mice made it to the island. Han Sen and the others didn’t want to stick around, so he picked up Little Silver and mounted Little Star with the others.</p>

<p>The way back was too complicated. Little Star rushed straight upwards, going through layers of rocks, and then it landed on the ground.</p>

<p>After looking around for a while, Han Sen realized that they were still in the Wind Song Desert He wanted to ask Lin Feng and Jing Jiwu where they were now, as he wanted to go back to the shelter before they did anything else.</p>

<p>Han Sen was still wearing the crystal heel, and it bugged him. Han Sen wanted to go somewhere with no one around and get the crystal shoe off.</p>

<p>However, just as he stepped off Little Star’s back, his left foot jerked forward.</p>
