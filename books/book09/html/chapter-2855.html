<h2>Spirit?</h2>
<h3>Chapter 2855</h3>

<p>The whole process was incredibly weird and amazing. Han Sen
watched Sky Vine Radish’s flesh and bones being rebuilt, bit by
bit. After a while, the new Sky Vine Radish was done.</p>
<p>Compared to the shell before, the Sky Vine Radish with a god
personality had a massively frightening lifeforce. That powerful
feeling was like when Han Sen had first encountered King Jun.
Although King Jun had given him this feeling, it was rather
different.</p>
<p>“Huh?” God looked at the reborn Sky Vine Radish with surprise.
It seemed as if he had discovered something quite interesting about
it.</p>
<p>Han Sen turned and asked, “What is it?”</p>
<p>“Sky Vine Radish seems to have some sort of problem,” God said
with a frown. He had been looking at Sky Vine Radish’s body.</p>
<p>“What is it?” Han Sen’s heart jumped. He seemed to have thought
of something.</p>
<p>“Inside his body… His spirit is gone…” God stared at the reborn
Sky Vine Radish. He sounded weird as he spoke.</p>
<p>“Spirit?” Han Sen asked. “Are you referring to the same sort of
spirits that the Nine-Defense Palace xenogeneics are also
missing?”</p>
<p>God nodded. “Yes, it’s the same. Previously, I told you that the
spirit is an uncertain part of a creature’s gene. That description
is not so accurate. In fact, I do not know how to describe what
this is because the existence of a spirit is very abstract.”</p>
<p>“Let me give you an example,” God said. “A father and mother
determine genetic genes. Even if the father and mother end up
having twins, the genes of the two babies are not the same. As they
grow up, their personalities and bodies develop and mature
differently. That is the result of one’s spirit.”</p>
<p>Han Sen hesitated and said, “The genes of a twin are different.
That is normal, right?” He did not understand what a spirit
was.</p>
<p>God thought for a moment and said, “Perhaps that example was not
appropriate. You should know gene duplicated creatures, right? In
theory, gene duplicated creatures should be the same as the
original gene creature. They would have the same personality. In
fact, if you let those gene duplicated creatures grow freely and
quickly, their shapes and bodies have different features. Even
their personalities would. That depends on the spirit.”</p>
<p>Upon hearing that, Han Sen, looked like he understood it, but he
did not understand it. This was not a question that could be
answered through words. There were no standard words to describe
it.</p>
<p>God knew full-well that Han Sen was still failing to understand.
He pointed at the newly reborn Sky Vine Radish and said, “Just like
Sky Vine Radish, the reborn Sky Vine Radish should have the same
spirit as before. That means this reborn Sky Vine Radish is a
continuous life hailing from the previous Sky Vine Radish. But now,
the reborn Sky Vine Radish has no spirit. That means he is just a
replica of Sky Vine Radish’s genes. The body is the same, but in
some way, he is not the same Sky Vine Radish as before.”</p>
<p>“Is there a difference?” Han Sen seemed to understand a little.
His heart understood something.</p>
<p>“To you, the biggest difference should be the fact that he will
not remember you were the one that murdered him before his rebirth
here,” God said. “Even if he found out, he would not care. Without
the last spirit, he will not know what happened to Sky Vine Radish
in the past and associate events of the previous Sky Vine Radish
with himself. He will not care.”</p>
<p>When Han Sen heard that, he was happy. “That means not having a
spirit is good. Does that mean he will not have a spirit ever
again?”</p>
<p>“What kind of god is one without a spirit? A creature should
always have a spirit, but the spirit should not be the same as
before. So, the spirit is different from the last one.” God looked
at Sky Vine Radish as he spoke.</p>
<p>By now, the green light on the altar was gone. Sky Vine Radish
had finished being reborn. He was like a god standing upon the
altar. He was slowly opening his eyes.</p>
<p>Han Sen thought, “Even if Sky Vine Radish does not remember the
past, he would not forgive some creature for entering his temple so
boldly.” Unexpectedly Sky Vine Radish’s vision went right past Han
Sen and landed on God.</p>
<p>Han Sen opened his mouth. He could not believe that had
happened.</p>
<p>Sky Vine Radish had a giant-like body, yet he suddenly jumped
better than a rabbit could. His giant body landed on the floor with
outstretched hands. He was kneeling in profuse worship. He placed
his head on the floor as he shivered and shook.</p>
<p>Han Sen was shocked. Although he thought God was stronger than
Sky Vine Radish, he did not expect that only a glimpse of God was
enough to make him behave so fearfully. He was more frightened than
a mouse encountering a cat.</p>
<p>At least, if a mouse saw a cat, it could run. Now, Sky Vine
Radish appeared as such. He could not even run. He had to kneel on
the ground shaking.</p>
<p>“Let’s go. It is almost time. There are a few more matches I
would like to watch.” God ignored Sky Vine Radish. He stretched and
walked out of the temple.</p>
<p>Han Sen looked at the kneeling Sky Vine Radish, who did not dare
raise his head. He left the Sky Vine Radish temple with God.</p>
<p>After exiting the temple, Han Sen looked back a few times. While
he was still able to see the temple, he saw that Sky Vine Radish
was still scared and unable to move. He did not get up.</p>
<p>When he walked the last stone step, Han Sen’s environment
changed. He was back inside Nine-Defense Palace.</p>
<p>“I did what you wanted me to do. In the next round, you must win
the fight. I have faith in you.” God smiled at Han Sen as he
spoke.</p>
<p>“Yes, I have faith in myself too.” Han Sen rubbed his nose.</p>
<p>God went back to the garden. Han Sen stayed where he was, using
the excuse that he was going to kill more xenogeneics. After
watching God leave, Han Sen looked into his Sea of Soul. He
examined Sky Vine Radish’s god spirit.</p>
<p>Han Sen thought, “Does this mean god spirits are the spirits God
mentioned? Because the god spirit was taken, Sky Vine Radish
spawned with no god spirit. So, will there be a new spirit getting
born? In that case, are beast souls their spirits? Is it just the
spirits of a low-level creature?”</p>
<p>“But hang on… God said the xenogeneics in Nine-Defense Palace
had no spirits. Where did their spirits go? How did the kings of
the Extreme King take their souls away? If beast souls really are
their spirits, how are humans able to kill xenogeneics and take
their spirits away? Even the god spirits were pulled away.” Han Sen
thought of a lot. He had the willies just thinking about it.</p>
<p>Han Sen felt as if he had a hold on something, but he had too
little information to figure it all out. It was like he had seen a
shadow through paper, but he could not see the figure.</p>
<p>“It looks like everything must wait until I become true god
class. I need to get into the geno hall to figure out everything.”
Han Sen sighed. He shelved his thoughts on the matter. He knew
over-thinking was not good for him. Increasing his power was the
top priority.</p>
<p>“I wonder what power this Sky Vine Radish God Lance has.” Han
Sen tried putting the Sky Radish Vine God Lance inside his Sea of
Soul, and it worked. The lance was like a beast soul. Han Sen put
it in his Sea of Soul. As Han Sen soon as thought of it, the Sky
Vine Radish God Lance appeared in his hands.</p>
<p>“So, can god personality armaments be placed inside the Sea of
Soul?” Han Sen’s expression looked complicated.</p>
