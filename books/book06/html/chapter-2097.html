<p>Sleepless Duke bellowed to the sky in rage.</p>
<p>Many other Night Ghosts screamed, too. They gave up attacking
the blue shield, and instead, they used their claws to cut their
own bodies. Blood flowed down like rain.</p>
<p>Sleepless Duke swung her Blood Demon Spear in slow arcs. The
red-pattern on it started to glow, and the rain of blood was drawn
towards the spear. When droplets of blood began to land on the
spear, they soaked into it, dyeing the weapon a deeper red.</p>
<p>It looked like the blood was pooling on the spear’s metal
surface, but no matter how much blood dripped onto it, not a single
smidgen was lost. The red light of the spear became brighter, and
the spear’s tip shone crimson.</p>
<p>That bloody light looked as if it could destroy space. It left
shadows in the air.</p>
<p>Sleepless Duke roared. She flapped her wings, lifted the Blood
Demon Spear, and flew toward the sphere like a waterfall. From the
ground, she looked like a red comet flying across the sky. The
atmosphere was tinged with the scent of blood, and then, she struck
the blue shield. The red light exploded against it, but the blue
shield did not break.</p>
<p>“There is not enough power in the spear yet! If you attack too
soon, you’ll waste the power of the blood you have already amassed.
Do you see the Blood Demon Orb on its end? Only when it begins to
shine will the max amount of power have been stored inside the
spear. Strike when it is bright! Han Sen and the others will all be
destroyed in one fell strike,” Kahn said, blinking.</p>
<p>There was nothing else Sleepless Duke could do. Looking
murderous, she called to the Night Ghosts again. The Night Ghosts
heard her scream, and they began tearing into their own bodies
again, trying to draw enough blood to power up the Blood Demon
Spear.</p>
<p>The Blood Demon Spear was getting brighter. Blood rained down on
the weapon like a storm, and the spear grew stronger and stronger.
But the Night Ghosts were running out of strength. Many had lost so
much blood that they fell limply to the ground.</p>
<p>“Why hasn’t the orb lit up yet?” Sleepless Duke shouted at
Kahn.</p>
<p>“This is a King class weapon. It isn’t that easy to activate. At
least half of these Night Ghosts need to die to trigger its power,”
Kahn said.</p>
<p>“I cannot let them die!” Sleepless Duke roared.</p>
<p>“There is no way back. We have to kill Han Sen now. If they
escape this planet, they will contact Sky Palace. And then, we will
all be killed. None of the Night Ghosts will be spared,” Kahn said
calmly.</p>
<p>Sleepless Duke gripped the Blood Demon Spear tightly. She looked
as if she was in pain. She looked around at the falling blood, at
the Night Ghosts who had already collapsed.</p>
<p>Those Night Ghosts had eaten many living creatures, and as a
result, their will was messed up. But they still followed Sleepless
Duke’s orders. They were all willing to bleed and bleed. None of
them chickened out or took the time to heal themselves.</p>
<p>“I am going to kill you all. It is because of you that the Night
Ghosts have become like this…” Sleepless Duke held the spear as it
glowed brighter and brighter. She ran in front of the blue shield,
snarling through her bared teeth, and roared at Han Sen. Her pretty
face was twisted.</p>
<p>“Sleepless Duke, you had it coming!” Han Sen smiled.</p>
<p>Han Sen’s words filled her with white-hot fury. She looked
murderous, and her eyes gleamed red. She began hurrying the Night
Ghosts to sacrifice even more blood.</p>
<p>“Quick! Hurry!” Sleepless Duke watched the Blood Demon Orb,
hoping it would light up soon. Otherwise, all the Night Ghosts
would be dead.</p>
<p>“Han Sen! Can your shield block that? That spear’s power looks
like it is King class,” the man said to Han Sen. He was still in
the process of wrapping up his wounds.</p>
<p>The blue shield was obviously very tough, but it looked like
thin glass. The man found himself doubting its ability to withstand
a King class attack.</p>
<p>“It should be fine,” Han Sen said. In truth, he wasn’t sure.</p>
<p>The Demon Bug King’s Bai Sema was a Mutant King beast soul. That
meant it was half-deified. It was a higher level than a King class
strike, so it should have been able to take whatever strike was
being prepped for him.</p>
<p>But that was all just theory. Han Sen had never tested how much
power the Demon Bug King’s Bai Sema could take. He didn’t know.</p>
<p>“What does should mean?” The man’s eyes opened wide as he looked
at Han Sen.</p>
<p>“That means probably.” Han Sen laughed.</p>
<p>“Oh my God.” The man held his forehead. He looked depressed as
he said, “I always have the worst luck. Never bet on luck.”</p>
<p>“Our only option here is to throw the dice, though. Do you have
a better idea?” Han Sen laughed.</p>
<p>“Oh no! It looks like Old Xi is going to die here.” The man
started to cry.</p>
<p>“What’s your name?” Han Sen asked, looking at the man.</p>
<p>“My name is Xi Menxiaong. You’re asking me this now? At a time
like this? Think about how we might dodge that scary power and
avoid death!” Xi Menxiaong said.</p>
<p>The blood was a downpour, and the spear was like a dragon.</p>
<p>It seemed like the whole of Planet Night Ghost was flooded with
a layer of blood. Its smell was everywhere, and even the sky was
choked with red clouds.</p>
<p>Half of the Night Ghosts were dead. It was too high of a price
to pay for King class power.</p>
<p>Sleepless Duke was full of hatred as she stared at Han Sen. If
that horrible stare had been solid, it would have peeled Han Sen’s
flesh from his bones.</p>
<p>The place was in ruin, and many of the Night Ghosts were dying
of blood loss. The ones in the sky were all trembling. It looked as
if they could all keel over and perish.</p>
<p>Sleepless Duke’s eyes were filled with blood tears, but she had
no choice but to continue.</p>
<p>The sky turned red like hell itself.</p>
<p>Boom!</p>
<p>The Blood Demon Orb was shining now. The red light lit up the
entire Blood Demon Spear. Sleepless Duke looked as if she was
holding a red laser.</p>
<p>“Go to hell!” Sleepless Duke spun the spear toward the blue
sphere. The shocking red light was coming at Han Sen. It looked as
if it could obliterate a galaxy.</p>
<p>Han Sen tried to dodge, but the red light was too scary. It
looked as if it had locked on, too. The red light was like a
volcano that had just erupted. There was nowhere that Han Sen and
the others could go to get away from that red light, and even the
air was torn apart by its passage.</p>
