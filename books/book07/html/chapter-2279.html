<p>Because Han Sen had used a fair amount of his own power, it
activated the hell power in his body. The ghost statue came to life
and flapped its wings. It rose above Han Sen, then dropped like a
hawk, its feet outstretched to grab Han Sen.</p>
<p>There was no way he would be able to dodge. The ghost statue was
drawn toward Han Sen’s hell power like a magnet. When its feet came
down, they were going to smash Han Sen into a pulp. The statue
fell, and its claws closed around Han Sen.</p>
<p>Dong!</p>
<p>The ghost statue’s claws grabbed the bird’s nest and tried to
crush it. They failed.</p>
<p>Hidden safely under the bird’s nest, Han Sen felt a modicum of
relief. If the bird’s nest was able to withstand the attacks of the
ghost statue, then that meant he had a chance to fight back.</p>
<p>Perhaps being under the cover of the bird’s nest calmed Han
Sen’s hell power. Regardless of the reason, the ghost statue
released the bird’s nest and returned to its spot atop the
pillar.</p>
<p>Han Sen spent a while thinking. He cast his Jadeskin power and
threw a punch at the ghost statue.</p>
<p>Jadeskin’s power might be perfect for this work. Perhaps using
that power wouldn’t trigger the hell power within Han Sen. Maybe he
could avoid waking up the ghost statue.</p>
<p>But that line of thought soon proved to be naive. As soon as Han
Sen teleported, he was sent flying again. Fortunately, he had the
bird’s nest to absorb some of the blow. With its help, he was able
to avoid death once more.</p>
<p>But even so, Han Sen was still bleeding a lot by this point.</p>
<p>Teeth power… Suppress Evil… Turtle skill… Under the Sky
knifeskill… Lone Bamboo’s swordskills… Thunder power… Fire power…
Ice power…</p>
<p>Han Sen used all the powers he could remember, but each one
proved to be useless. No matter what power he summoned, the ghost
statue would break it. Han Sen couldn’t touch the horrid thing, and
it kept tossing him aside like a toy. If it wasn’t for the aid of
the bird’s nest, he would have been killed many times.</p>
<p>Even with the bird’s nest for protection, his impacts with the
bridge had injured him. His wounds might not have been as bad as
they looked, but they did look very bad.</p>
<p>“Stop trying. Just go!” Yisha growled. She was feeling a complex
mixture of emotions.</p>
<p>Han Sen had that bird’s nest for protection, so he had some
measure of protection from deified attacks. If there was a deified
elite around, though, his ability to escape wasn’t guaranteed. But
Han Sen was taking so many risks in his attempts to free her that
Yisha couldn’t help but feel touched.</p>
<p>Yisha didn’t believe she had treated Han Sen all that well. She
had simply given him resources. And she had only taken him as a
student because of a bet she had once struck with a psychic. It was
only afterward that she realized that having Han Sen as a student
wasn’t all bad.</p>
<p>When she realized that she had a student who would fight for her
in a situation as dire as this, it was difficult not to feel
touched.</p>
<p>Yisha would never have considered that Han Sen might be doing
this because he didn’t want to lose an advantage. Her life being at
stake was only a small part of it.</p>
<p>Han Sen wasn’t going to lose Yisha and a half-deified blood
kirin. That was why he kept trying and trying. He didn’t want to
lose so much.</p>
<p>Han Sen had the bird’s nest, so he wasn’t going to die easily.
That’s why he kept trying. But the results of his attacks were not
encouraging. Han Sen tried every trick in the book, but none of his
powers could overcome the ghost statue’s power.</p>
<p>The ghost statue responded to hell power far too well. It was
like cause and effect. If Han Sen had hell power, it meant he was
going to get hit by the ghost statue. There was no other possible
outcome.</p>
<p>In all his attacks, Han Sen hadn’t touched the ghost statue’s
forehead once. Thinking about getting the hell blood out of the
ghost statue’s forehead was useless, because he couldn’t.</p>
<p>As Han Sen kept trying and getting knocked back, even his armor
was dyed red by the blood that spilled from him. Yisha’s expression
looked pained.</p>
<p>The ghost statue struck Han Sen again and sent him crashing down
into the bridge once more. This time, though, he stayed hidden
beneath the bird’s nest for a while.</p>
<p>“Are you dead yet? If you’re not, then get lost!” Yisha shouted
angrily. But her eyes shimmered.</p>
<p>Han Sen didn’t move. He was hiding under the bird’s nest,
thinking about how he might break the hell power, or the connection
between it and the ghost statue.</p>
<p>“I have used all of my powers at least once, and even so, I
haven’t been able to land a hit. The only possibility remaining is
to use my super god spirit body. By using my super god spirit body,
I can remove the hell power and avoid being harmed by the ghost
statue. But if I do that, then Yisha will know that I am Dollar.
This is bad.” Han Sen felt depressed.</p>
<p>After everything he had been through, though, seeing Yisha and
the blood kirin get killed was the last thing he wanted. He needed
to try this, even if it meant exposing his identity.</p>
<p>As Han Sen was thinking, Yisha shouted, “Han Sen, are you dead
yet? Get out of here if you aren’t!”</p>
<p>“My Queen, why would one like myself die so easily? You
underestimate the fortitude of your students.” Han Sen placed the
bird’s nest on his head like a hat as he spoke to Yisha.</p>
<p>His body and face were drenched in blood, and with the bird’s
nest on his head—although it was a very sober situation—it looked
rather funny.</p>
<p>Yisha’s lips were shaking, but after a brief while, they
returned to a cold stare again. She looked at Han Sen, opened her
lips, and sprayed spittle at him.</p>
<p>Drops of blood fell down on Han Sen like rain. Han Sen was
surprised, and he wasn’t quite sure what Yisha was doing.</p>
<p>Dong-ong!</p>
<p>Within that sprinkling of blood, something landed on the bridge
in front of Han Sen.</p>
<p>Han Sen took a closer look. It was a red sewing needle. It was
thinner than a hair, and it was around the length of a finger.</p>
<p>“What is this?” Han Sen picked it up. He thought that something
about the sewing needle was very unusual.</p>
<p>It felt like it was made of bone rather than metal. It was very
small, but it was hollow inside. It was more like a needle for
injection than a sewing needle.</p>
<p>When Han Sen lifted the bone needle, he felt it summon power
inside his body. His energy started to circulate.</p>
<p>Han Sen stared with wide eyes; the power that was running was
Blood-Pulse Plunder, which he had learned not so long ago.</p>
<p>Yisha said quietly, “Most of the items I brought along with me
were destroyed. This is a small item I managed to obtain from a
broken statue. Take it as a souvenir and go.”</p>
<p>Upon hearing that, Han Sen suddenly became very happy. “The
statue you mentioned, is that the one in the ruined palace?”</p>
<p>“Stop wasting f*cking time! Get out now! Even if I die, you have
to reclaim Planet Blade. Take care of my palace, because I don’t
want anyone to touch my stuff,” Yisha snarled.</p>
