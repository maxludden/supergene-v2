      Lou Jia waited until Han Yufei was gone, and they were at their most
      relieved. He reached his hand out to Ji Yanran, hoping to take
      Littleflower.
    </p>
    <p>
      Stay Up Late frowned and wanted to help, but just as he was going to
      strike, he stopped. There were two scary powers coming out of Ji Yanran.
    </p>
    <p>One of them was from the baby.</p>
    <p>
      Luo Jia’s hand was about to touch Littleflower when the baby’s body began
      to glow with white light. Lou Jia couldn’t touch Littleflower, even though
      he was only three inches away.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lou Jia’s eyes opened wide in disbelief. Although he had no geno armor, he
      had broken through the Fourth God’s Sanctuary and become a god. He hadn’t
      generated a geno armor yet, but his powers were stronger than any demigod,
      and he should have been stronger than a one-year-old child regardless.
    </p>
    <p>
      The power Littleflower released was as strong as his own, and he couldn’t
      believe it.
    </p>
    <p>
      “How can… a human child… have this kind of power? Did Han Jinzhi give that
      stuff to this kid…” Lou Jia was in shock. He wanted to take Littleflower
      even more.
    </p>
    <p>
      If Littleflower possessed what they wanted, he would be highly rewarded
      after taking the baby.
    </p>
    <p>
      Power exploded from Lou Jia’s body. He used force to reach further toward
      Littleflower, but there was a horrible power coming out of Ji Yanran, as
      well.
    </p>
    <p>
      There were crystal high heels on Ji Yanran’s feet. They looked like living
      things, and all of a sudden, they wrapped up Ji Yanran’s body in crystal
      armor.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ji Yanran was not good at fighting, but she was still a surpasses And if
      she had to fight, she could. She lifted her leg and started to kick the
      intruder. This did not require skill, and the crystal legs came firmly up
      to Lou Jia’s head.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a pang sound, and before Lou Jia could react, his head was
      completely broken. Blood and brain matter were scattered all about.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was too powerful and it happened too fast. Lou Jia’s body stood there
      for a while before it crumpled and collapsed onto the ground.
    </p>
    <p>
      Zero and Lou Lan stood mutely, staring at Ji Yanran and her dead attacker.
      Then they stared at Ji Yanran’s crystal armor.
    </p>
    <p>
      Stay Up Late looked at them from afar, seeming very excited. He stared at
      Littleflower and Ji Yanran, in particular.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Human children can possess this power? They can evolve to that level?
      This is unbelievable.” Stay Up Late looked at Littleflower in shock.
    </p>
    <p>
      But when he looked at the crystal armor, he seemed to confirm something
      that confused him.
    </p>
    <p>
      “That should be impossible.” After looking at them some more, Stay Up Late
      glanced around. Then he disappeared. When he showed up again, he was at
      the back door of the cafe.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Interesting family. It looks like I was right.” Stay Up Late put on his
      apron, and a strange smile crossed his face.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Stay Up Late, why were you in the bathroom for so long? Customers are
      waiting.” The manager looked annoyed as he spoke.
    </p>
    <p>
      “I am sorry. I had an upset stomach. I will get to work now.” Stay Up Late
      walked over to the grinding machine. “Handsome dude, get me a cup of
      coffee! I want a freshly-ground one.”
    </p>
    <p>“Me, too…”</p>
    <p>“Can I have some love, please?”</p>
    <p>
      A group of rich, middle-aged women were standing outside. They enjoyed
      teasing Stay Up Late, who had just returned.
    </p>
    <p>“Just a moment, please.” Stay Up Late made the coffee with a smile.</p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      In Shadow Shelter, Han Sen was in a bad situation. The white donkey was
      right beside him, and he had to split his energy between dealing with
      Ancient Devil and the donkey too
    </p>
    <p>
      His Overbearing Shield had been destroyed, and only the Bulwark Umbrella
      was available for his protection. It put him in a tough spot.
    </p>
    <p>
      Split-Blade was held firmly in Han Sen’s hand, but it wasn’t as useful as
      Overbearing Shield. He was getting attacked by a whole group, and he
      couldn’t fight back much.
    </p>
    <p>Katcha!</p>
    <p>
      After he got hit twice, the surface of the umbrella cracked. Han Sen’s
      heartfelt heavy.
    </p>
    <p>
      “It looks like I’ll have to use Destiny’s Tower.” Han Sen had resigned
      himself to it. The fact was, if he didn’t win the fight right now, there
      would be no afterwards. Exposing his identity did not matter too much if
      the alternative was death.
    </p>
    <p>
      But before he used the Blood Legion technique, he felt his Dongxuan Sutra
      undergo a change.
    </p>
    <p>
      His Dongxuan Sutra had one last tier he had thus far been unable to break
      into. That was why Bulwark Umbrella had been unable to level up.
    </p>
    <p>
      Han Sen had four geno cores. The Crystal Core connected to the new
      Jadeskin. There were no more additional levels that it could achieve.
    </p>
    <p>
      Real Blood connected to the Blood-Pulse Sutra. There was one more skill he
      could still learn, and it should be the skill to level up to the Fifth
      Sanctuary.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dollar connected to his super king spirit body. Han Sen did not have to
      practice that any longer; when super king spirit got stronger, Dollar geno
      core would follow.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bulwark Umbrella connected to the Dongxuan Sutra. There was still one more
      tier for it to ascend. Aside from the part which was linked to leveling up
      to the Fifth Sanctuary, there was another part created by Dongxuan Zi, the
      man who could break through the vacuum.
    </p>
    <p>
      That part was the Dongxuan Sutra’s ability to leave the Alliance. Han Sen
      took it seriously, and he practiced that the most.
    </p>
    <p>
      When Dongxuan Zi broke through the vacuum, he accidentally entered the
      First God’s Sanctuary. The place he had wanted to go was the Hero’s Spirit
      Hall, where those powerful creatures had died. But he ended up going to
      the First God’s Sanctuary instead. Something must have gone wrong.
    </p>
    <p>
      That explained why Dongxuan Zi was injured and died. Dongxuan Zi was much
      stronger than Han Sen, and after he broke through the vacuum, he was alive
      in the First God’s Sanctuary. And he spent time writing the Dongxuan
      Sutra. It was odd that he had just died like that.
    </p>
    <p>Han Sen only had one explanation for this.</p>
    <p>
      Dongxuan Zi’s power was stronger than the strength of the five
      sanctuaries, and that included the Alliance. That was why he went to the
      First God’s Sanctuary. It was the sanctuary above where the gods lived.
    </p>
    <p>
      According to the rules of the sanctuary, creatures in a higher tier would
      ruin their body if they went one sanctuary lower. That was why Dongxuan Zi
      died. He couldn’t recover.
    </p>
    <p>
      Han Sen wanted to practice the Dongxuan Sutra, but the Dongxuan Sutra was
      the slowest of all skills.
    </p>
    <p>
      Especially the last step in the fourth tier. He had practiced for so long
      and had not had a breakthrough. Now the umbrella was damaged and the
      Dongxuan Sutra was exhibiting changes; Han Sen was so happy.
