<p>Han Sen thought for a while. He brought a few pieces of fruit
out of Destiny’s Tower to give to the Crocodile God.</p>
<p>“This little Crocodile God is just a baby. It should be an easy
thing to please. All I need to do is keep it happy, then I can do
anything I want. I wonder if it is a vegetarian? I don’t have much
meat stockpiled at the moment.” Ever since Han Sen started
collecting King xenogeneic genes, he hadn’t been eating anything
else. The fruit was something he had saved for Bao’er.</p>
<p>But ever since Bao’er had found that purple ginseng, she hadn’t
shown interest in anything else. No other type of fruit enticed
her, so Han Sen had been keeping them inside Destiny’s Tower the
whole time.</p>
<p>If someone wanted their body to evolve, the process would take a
lot more than just practicing various geno arts. The higher class a
person was, the more energy their body would require. And the food
they consumed had to be of greater quality. That was the only way
to deliver the extra needed energy. Every creature in the universe
had to eat; the only differences were in how and what they ate.</p>
<p>High-class elites could go without food for a long time, but the
price they paid for that was the consumption of their energy. If
that went on for a long time, their bodies would be damaged quite
severely.</p>
<p>When people said they didn’t need to eat while practicing, it
was a load of rubbish. In real life, you would die if you didn’t
eat. The starvation process just took a little longer for strong
people than for the weak.</p>
<p>This didn’t just apply to warriors with ordinary levels of
power. In Han Sen’s experience, even guys that called themselves
“God” had to eat, too. But instead of eating flesh, they ate the
lifespan of the people that came to them to make wishes.</p>
<p>The little Crocodile God had to eat, too, but it didn’t show any
interest in the fruit Han Sen had given it. It used its tail to
sweep all the pieces of fruit away.</p>
<p>“It looks like it doesn’t eat fruit or veggies. In that case,
what kind of food does it eat?” Han Sen tried to guess, but he had
no meat to share. Then again, Han Sen doubted that the creature
wanted to eat meat, either. If it had, Han Sen, Li Keer, and
Exquisite would’ve already become crocodile chow.</p>
<p>The little God Crocodile growled at Han Sen. This was the second
time, and it was clearly rushing Han Sen to get to work. And so he
did, clearing the shattered crystals all around him.</p>
<p>The little Crocodile God had assumed the role of the inspector.
It commanded Han Sen to do things, like throwing the shattered
crystals out of the fortress and into the lava sea that was held at
bay outside.</p>
<p>Han Sen wasn’t in a rush, and neither was he annoyed. He just
stuck to his tasks of sweeping and cleaning up, hoping to find
something useful as he went.</p>
<p>The small God Crocodile was pleased with Han Sen’s work ethic.
The little Crocodile God seemed born to be a supervisor, and it
seemed very pleased to be doing this sort of work.</p>
<p>But Han Sen failed to find anything interesting as he went. And
when the little God Crocodile eventually grew bored, it brought Han
Sen back to the swimming pool with it.</p>
<p>When Han Sen arrived back at the swimming pool, he found Li Keer
and Exquisite giving the big Crocodile God a head massage. They
were using a brush to scrub its body, too.</p>
<p>Li Keer and Exquisite looked like a perfect picture of misery.
They had never dreamed of being forced to do something this
demeaning.</p>
<p>They had been taught that as members of the Very High, their
futures held incredible potential. They had dreamed of doing many
things, but never of working as a crocodile’s maids. Especially
with someone like Dollar around to see their humiliation.</p>
<p>The big Crocodile God was a harsh taskmaster, but Li Keer and
Exquisite were eventually allowed a break.</p>
<p>“Did you find anything around here?” Exquisite asked Han Sen, as
the two of them approached.</p>
<p>“Just more shattered crystal. There doesn’t seem to be a single
thing of interest, otherwise.” Han Sen had already stuffed the arm
bones into his Destiny’s Tower. He didn’t plan on informing the
girls about his discovery.</p>
<p>“What about you two?” Han Sen asked.</p>
<p>“What could we find? All we’ve been doing is sweeping up crap
all day. I have no idea how these two eat so much. They piss
wherever they like, too,” Li Keer said, her expression morose.</p>
<p>Han Sen’s heart leaped. He quickly asked, “Can you tell me what
they’ve been eating?”</p>
<p>“How the hell should I know what they eat? Their dung is like
firm orbs. It looks just like the materials that make up the planet
itself,” Li Keer said.</p>
<p>“In that case, maybe they are eating material that comes from
the planet,” Han Sen said after a moment of thought.</p>
<p>“What is the point of knowing what they eat?” Li Keer asked.</p>
<p>“It would let us rest easy in the knowledge that they don’t want
to eat us, at least. If that’s the case, we are quite lucky,” Han
Sen said with a shrug of his shoulders.</p>
<p>“If I’m going to be trapped in here for the rest of my life, I
think I would rather die.” Li Keer didn’t agree with Han Sen’s line
of thinking.</p>
<p>“We aren’t carrying much food ourselves. We need to find a way
to get out of here,” Exquisite said.</p>
<p>“Do you know a way out of here?” Han Sen asked.</p>
<p>“Not right now.” Exquisite shook her head.</p>
<p>“Then there’s no point in talking about it,” Han Sen said
gloomily.</p>
<p>The three of them rested for a while. The little Crocodile God
soon came over, hurrying them back to work.</p>
<p>Out of the three, Han Sen had the best chance of working outside
the pool area. The two girls were worse off, as they were stuck
serving the Crocodile God on the beach. They swept up crap or
massaged the crocodile’s scales. They were just like maids.</p>
<p>It was likely that the crocodiles were the only beings in the
universe using two of the Very High as maids, but god only knew how
long they would enjoy this service.</p>
<p>Han Sen was outside, setting toppled pieces of equipment upright
or cleaning up devices that had been completely destroyed. In the
beginning, the little Crocodile God was really interested in
ordering him around. But after a while, it became too lazy and
stopped.</p>
<p>Once he was free of his miniature overlord, Han Sen could walk
around the fortress. While looking through a random plaza, he
finally found something.</p>
<p>Crystal was a technological product. It wasn’t normally used to
create things like tablets, but in that plaza, Han Sen found a
crystal wall with text on it.</p>
<p>Because the crystal wall was broken, it took Han Sen almost
three days to collect all of the fragments and piece the wall back
together. Then, he was able to read the text in full.</p>
<p>“Crystal Furnace skill… This seems to be a geno art, but the
name is very weird. I wonder what it does?” Han Sen began reading
through the content a little more closely.</p>
<p>After all, the geno arts of the crystallizers were usually quite
suitable for humans to practice. But Han Sen wasn’t very hopeful
for the potential of a crystallizer geno art, because the
crystallizers weren’t very famous for their geno arts. Their skills
were rarely exceptional.</p>
<p>But after Han Sen read about the Crystal Furnace, he was given a
fright.</p>
<p>This wasn’t exactly a geno art. It was a godly skill for people
who loved to eat.</p>
<p>The Crystal Furnace was a way to reinforce one’s stomach. It was
different from Consume, which focused on the ability to digest
food. By contrast, the Crystal Furnace turned one’s stomach into a
nuclear reactor. It quickly released the energy of food, and the
energy released would be immediately absorbed. The waste would come
out quickly.</p>
<p>“No wonder the crystallizers have such a reputation for research
and development. Even their geno arts are scientific.” Han Sen
loved it. He wouldn’t turn down a new geno art that aided his
digestion.</p>
<p>But when Han Sen reached the end of the text for Crystal
Furnace, he saw an additional note.</p>
<p>“The public version of Crystal Furnace is only suitable for kids
below sixteen. For those who are above sixteen, please practice
Crystal Core Reactor.”</p>
<p>“This is the kids’ version?” Han Sen was annoyed by that, but he
couldn’t find the adult version of Crystal Furnace, so he had to
learn the kids’ version first.</p>
