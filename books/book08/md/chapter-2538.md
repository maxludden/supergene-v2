This time, Dragon Blood Evilbreaker didn’t have enough power to contain their enemy. It was still effective, though. Things didn’t go awry as they had last time when they fought the Gold Armor General.

Han Sen was holding his Dragon Tattoo Tooth Dagger tightly. He teleported behind Big Evil Beast. His time learning teleportation skills hadn’t been wasted; he was able to appear next to Big Evil Beast in a moment.

The dagger was brimming with Han Sen’s power when it cut through the enemy’s wings. The powerful of Han Sen’s strike ripped through the tissue of the wing all the way down its length. That was the creature’s weakest spot. The rest of the monster’s body was covered in scales, and not even with the Dragon Tattoo Tooth Dagger could damage those locations.

After he pierced through the wing, Han Sen saw a small part of the creature’s back, next to where the wings used to be attached, that wasn’t protected by scales. Han Sen stabbed the monster with the dagger, sending its power through the beast’s flesh. The creature’s flesh wasn’t as tough as its scales were, but the flesh was still harder than that of an ordinary half-deified xenogeneic. Han Sen’s dagger couldn’t cut deep enough to reach the creature’s heart.

Upon feeling the strike, Big Evil Beast roared. Its aura of evil descended upon the system, cloaking everything around Han Sen and the others. When it flapped its wings, black feathers were fired everywhere like a hail of arrows.

Han Sen stood before that hailstorm of feather arrows. He knew that he wouldn’t be able to dodge them, and neither could he deflect them all. Judging by the radius of the attack, he wouldn’t even be able to teleport to a safe distance.

Han Sen didn’t hesitate. He used his super god spirit body. The arrows passed harmlessly through him, and then Han Sen raced into Big Evil Beast’s body. He reached the heart and stabbed it with his dagger.

The super god spirit body only lasted a second. After that, he was back to normal. Fortunately, in that time, Han Sen was able to rush into Big Evil Beast’s heart and stab the organ repeatedly like a madman. Blood spilled everywhere. Big Evil Beast screamed, flapping around in circles like it was deranged. It was unable to do anything to Han Sen, who was in its heart.

Dragon One, Dia Robber, and the others watched as Big Evil Beast shrieked and spewed blood everywhere. Someone murmured, “Brother Dollar really is one of the Very High! He is only King class, but he is already so strong. If he becomes half-deified, will he be able to fight a proper deified?”

“What are you saying about becoming half-deified? He is already fighting a deified,” someone shot back.

“After seeing Brother Dollar, I know what a real champion looks like.”

“Such amazing power. It would be very hard for any race other than the Very High to do this. Not even the Extreme King has Kings on par with Dollar.”

“What do you mean by ‘very hard’? Feats like this are clearly impossible for anyone else.”

As everyone was discussing this, they suddenly heard Big Evil Beast roar louder than before. Its scream was interrupted as its mouth filled with blood. Dragon One saw the creature cough out some chunks of flesh with the blood.

Dia Robber and the Destroyed were so happy. “Brother Dollar is so strong! That Big Evil Beast must be dead.”

Shortly thereafter, Big Evil Beast’s blood ran dry. Its movements slowed, and its lifeforce grew weak. The evil aura that had weighed on them all disappeared as the creature’s substance chains dissipated one at a time.

Dragon One and Dia Robber moved forward to finish it off. They ran to attack the Big Evil Beast with all their strength, but they didn’t have the Dragon Tattoo Tooth Dagger, and so they couldn’t deal any damage to the Big Evil Beast. Despite launching a frantic series of attacks, they couldn’t penetrate Big Evil Beast’s scales. They could only further damage its wings.

Blergh!

Big Evil Beast spilled more blood. Then, someone emerged from the bloody body. It was Han Sen, and he cut his way out, still clutching the Dragon Tattoo Tooth Dagger.

After Han Sen came out, the Big Evil Beast lost all control of its body. Its carcass floated in the system like a fish gone belly-up. Blood cloaked its form, and it twitched weakly from time to time.

“Xenogeneic core deified hunted: Big Evil Beast. Deified xenogeneic gene found.”

Han Sen felt depressed. Again, there was no beast soul. “It looks like my luck has run out. Two deifieds and still no beast souls.”

Han Sen felt like high-class xenogeneics had a lower drop rate than low-class xenogeneics. Han Sen couldn’t be certain that was the case, but it was the way he was currently feeling.

“Thank you for your assistance, Brother Dollar.” Dia Robber was thrilled, and he thanked Han Sen profusely.

“You are welcome, Brother Robber. It was a fair trade, and I didn’t help you out of charity.” Han Sen also returned the dagger to Dragon One.

“Is Brother Dollar still interested in hunting more xenogeneics?” Dragon One asked as he accepted the dagger.

“I want to research the geno arts that I’ve received recently. I don’t plan on killing more xenogeneics right now. So, perhaps another time.” Han Sen shook his head.

Dia Robber and Dragon One felt disappointed, but if Han Sen didn’t want to go, then there was nothing they could do about that. They left the core area.

Han Sen and Li Keer visited the nearby systems. They killed any xenogeneic Kings they saw. If they didn’t find any, they kept traveling. Han Sen used most of his power to practice Li Keer’s God’s Wander and the Destroyed’s Big Destroyed.

He practiced Big Destroyed for the longest time in that hope that Big Destroyed could help speed up his consumption of King class genes.

Li Keer saw Han Sen practicing Big Destroyed and said, “That geno art was designed by the alpha of the Destroyed. It was created based on the unique design of their bodies. Light, dark, and chaos must be balanced within you. The geno art can’t be practiced unless you have all three of those elements. Even among the Destroyed, only pure-blood Destroyed can practice it. Not many outsiders can learn it, that is for sure.”

“I am just giving it a try,” Han Sen said, unperturbed. He focused on using the Dongxuan Sutra to practice Big Destroyed.

When Han Sen was in the sanctuaries, his body had evolved using all the elements. That included light, dark, and chaos elements. Plus, the Dongxuan Sutra itself enabled him to simulate geno arts. So, Han Sen was reasonably confident that he would be able to practice Big Destroyed. If he hadn’t believed this, he wouldn’t have risked fighting a deified xenogeneic to get his hands on the geno art.

When Li Keer saw that Dollar continued to practice Big Destroyed despite her warning, she said nothing more. She just didn’t think Han Sen would succeed.

Even the Very High would have trouble learning Big Destroyed. The Very High Sense wouldn’t be of much help. Even if Han Sen had a similar geno art, it wouldn’t get him very far.

But Li Keer didn’t know that Han Sen’s Dongxuan Sutra wasn’t a creation of the Very High. Many parts of the geno art had been designed for entirely different purposes, and it was possible for him to do things that the Very High could not.
