<h2>Red Mist King Is Shining</h2>
<h3>Chapter 1959</h3>

<p>Han Sen’s fingers flashed with gold. The sky suddenly lit up, as
the golden lights became coins that rained down. They covered an
area of a dozen miles.</p>
<p>Ordinary Viscounts would not have power such as that. At best,
they could only encompass an area of a few hundred meters. But Han
Sen had his Soul Armor boost right now. The shadow of the
Four-Faced Eight-Armed Buddha lurked behind him, unseen. The Buddha
light was inside Han Sen’s body, imbuing him with the power of a
Marquise. That was how he was able to summon the big Dollar
rain.</p>
<p>All the gold lights became coins, which landed across the Meka’s
xenogeneic gene battle bodies. It was like the Meka had been hit
with big chunks of metal, making them heavier.</p>
<p>The lower level xenogeneic gene battle bodies crashed to the
ground. The bodies belonging to those of a higher level began to
move slower.</p>
<p>“Amitabha!” Clear Sea King spoke the Buddha catchphrase, but he
didn’t do anything. He went through the coinfall and came before
Han Sen. He waved his sleeve like a cloud, trying to capture Han
Sen inside it.</p>
<p>Han Sen didn’t dodge, though. His left-hand possessed a red
mist, and it shone. A strong red metal body came out of it. It
threw a punch towards Clear Sea King.</p>
<p>Boom!</p>
<p>A scary red mist light punched into Clear Sea King’s sleeve. The
sleeve deflated and tore. The red light went through the sleeve, up
and into his chest.</p>
<p>Clear Sea King started to bleed as his body was sent flying
away. He went barreling down the street like a meteor, crashing
into Battle King’s ornate house. He broke the palace-like construct
in half.</p>
<p>Everyone watching was stunned. No one could believe that a King
had been sent flying like that.</p>
<p>Han Sen was shocked, too. He used Clear Sea King’s mistake to
give himself an advantage and opportunity. He didn’t expect that a
less-than-one-percent release of energy could be so powerful that
it’d knock a King class into the distance.</p>
<p>Han Sen didn’t spare much time thinking, though. Red Mist King
picked up Han Sen and sprinted towards the teleporter.</p>
<p>There was a boom noise. All the buildings and xenogeneic gene
battle bodies in front of Red Mist King were pushed away.</p>
<p>The Meka were still frozen, and not a single one of them moved.
With Clear Sea King having been punched away, none dared step in
Han Sen’s path.</p>
<p>A roar came out of Battle King’s house. Battle King was riding a
giant, bear-shaped xenogeneic gene battle body forward, wanting to
stop Han Sen and Red Mist King.</p>
<p>Battle King hadn’t expected something of this sort could happen.
He thought that since Clear Sea King was right next to Han Sen,
Battle King himself would only have to make sure his subordinates
were in order. He hadn’t expected Han Sen to pose such a threat.
Now it was too late, and Red Mist King was jumping into a
teleporter alongside Han Sen, to disappear amidst the depths of
space.</p>
<p>Battle King roared. His battle body broke the teleporter, but
his anger was futile.</p>
<p>Clear Sea King came out of the rubble with lips caked in blood.
He looked awful. He was injured, but most of all, he was angry.</p>
<p>Han Sen went back to the copper palace. He got out of Red Mist
King’s hand, and Little Seven came out of Red Mist King’s
heart.</p>
<p>That punch had consumed all of Red Mist King’s energy. There was
only 0.01% of energy left now, and it hurt Han Sen to see.</p>
<p>Luckily, he had managed to obtain one hundred Galaxy Sand
crystals. If he hadn’t gotten those, it would have been a grand
loss.</p>
<p>Back on Planet Eclipse, Han Sen researched the Meka. He noticed
that news concerning Dollar and Clear Sea King had spread far
across the universe.</p>
<p>The Buddha and the Meka had put out an APB on Red Mist King and
Dollar. If anyone could provide a lead that led to either of their
capture, they would be handsomely rewarded.</p>
<p>Han Sen saw the rewards up for grabs, and fancied taking off his
own head for Red Mist King to deliver.</p>
<p>The entire geno universe was talking about it, but they were
mostly talking about Red Mist King.</p>
<p>People began talking about the last time Red Mist King had made
an appearance. It became known that he was a rare Meka xenogeneic
gene battle body, and that he must be King class.</p>
<p>But before that, no one had ever seen Red Mist King. Not even
the Meka knew about him, which was fairly scary.</p>
<p>A mysterious xenogeneic gene battle body and a human named
Dollar had managed to scam a King class Buddha and escape from
Meka. It just didn’t sound possible.</p>
<p>Many creatures now hoped to find them, in the hopes of obtaining
the rewards put up by the factions slighted.</p>
<p>The Buddha were in a major rush to find him, in particular. They
had just lost Seven Spirit, and Speechless herself had been
kidnapped. It was a divine insult. But after a long time of
searching, no one was able to find out anything concerning Dollar
and Red Mist King.</p>
<p>When Yisha heard that Dollar had appeared on Meka, she herself
assembled a group to find out more. But they didn’t uncover
anything, either.</p>
<p>Han Sen took the one hundred grains of Galaxy Sand to the
Alliance. He planned on refining them while he practiced The Story
of Genes.</p>
<p>Other geno arts could advance and achieve breakthroughs by
simple practice, but The Story of Genes required some sort of
external force.</p>
<p>Han Sen brought out the Galaxy Sand grains, but before he
started refining them, he saw a blue shadow travel through the
wall. It appeared like a phantom.</p>
<p>“Little Star, why are you here?” Han Sen was surprised as he
looked at Little Star. Little Star had eaten many xenogeneic genes,
and he was very talented. So, he had now reached the Alliance.</p>
<p>Little Star was very tame, and he was able to travel through
materials. He had never entered a room without permission before,
though.</p>
<p>Little Star’s sudden appearance in Han Sen’s room was very
weird.</p>
<p>Little Star canceled its Starsea Travel, and it brought its
shiny body right up to Han Sen. It was staring at Han Sen’s Galaxy
Sand.</p>
<p>“You want this?” Han Sen then thought to himself, “Little Star’s
original name was Starsea Beast. Galaxy Sand came from the Galaxy
Dragon. Are they connected?”</p>
<p>Little Star nodded and started licking Han Sen’s face.</p>
<p>“Bringing this back here cost me a fortune.” Han Sen looked at
the box of Galaxy Sand with regret.</p>
<p>But seeing the look on Little Star’s face, he didn’t want to
reject its request. So, he took one out and coughed. “I’ll let you
try one.”</p>
