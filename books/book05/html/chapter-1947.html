	<p>Ordinary people could not withstand the music, and the chiming of the bell was far more grueling.</p>

	<p>Even Seven Spirit himself, who had practiced the Buddha geno art and acquired the four-faced, eight-armed Buddha
		form, was having a hard time under the bell’s oppression. He was losing control of his body.</p>

	<p>Han Sen was a Viscount, and yet he had escaped the music. Seven Spirit could barely believe it.</p>

	<p>The ordinary heavenly music and the bell were not physical attacks; they were more like a torturing of the mind.
		But this was a department where Han Sen excelled. His will was as strong as a deified elite’s, so he wasn’t
		affected by the Buddha Heaven’s music.</p>

	<p>He pretended to be affected so he could lure Seven Spirit forward and ensure that the Buddha wouldn’t give up
		chasing him.</p>

	<p>Now, Seven Spirit had fallen under the bell’s influence. And that meant it was time for Han Sen to strike back.
	</p>

	<p>Han Sen’s rabbit shoes were moving in a blur, flinging him forward like a shadow. The Ghost Teeth Knife gave off
		a purple knifelight as it came swinging at Seven Spirit.</p>

	<p>Seven Spirit wished to flee, but as soon as he started to do so, his arm and legs flailed in a dance. His legs
		weren’t following his commands, and he couldn’t move the way he wanted to.</p>

	<p>Pang!</p>

	<p>The knifelight was broken by Seven Spirit’s hands. The four-faced, eight-armed Buddha body was quite scary.</p>

	<p>Han Sen’s face did not change. He kept swinging the Ghost Teeth Knife and using Teeth Knife knife skills. His
		body continued to flash around Seven Spirit.</p>

	<p>Seven Spirit stumbled back, using his eight arms to fight against Han Sen. But at various times, some parts of
		his body would lose all control. He began to make mistakes he wouldn’t have, otherwise.</p>

	<p>A moment was all that it took for him to make a big mistake. Even though Han Sen’s body was inferior to Seven
		Spirit’s, it was through all those mistakes that Han Sen could discern his flaws.</p>

	<p>Ghost Teeth Knife’s purple knifelight slashed down on Seven Spirit. It created a spark and left a white mark on
		his golden body. Then, it disappeared.</p>

	<p>“What a powerful xenogeneic body!” Han Sen was shocked. He didn’t cast Ghost Teeth Knife’s power a lot, but it
		was still easy for him to kill an Earl. The fact that he couldn’t leave much of a mark on Seven Spirit’s body
		spoke volumes about just how scary the Buddha’s body was.</p>

	<p>Seven Spirit looked furious. His eyes shone gold, and his eight arms tried to generate a spirit to attack Han
		Sen. Now his body was losing more and more control, though. Too many of his flaws were being exposed. He
		couldn’t suppress Han Sen as he had earlier.</p>

	<p>Han Sen depended entirely on his rabbit shoes for speed. The Red Mink Gloves gave him increased power. With the
		two, Ghost Teeth Knife continued to hack at the four-faced, eight-armed Buddha body.</p>

	<p>But his attacks could only leave white scrapes across the gold body. The Teeth powers could not latch onto Seven
		Spirit.</p>

	<p>Seven Spirit wished to escape Heaven now, but it was too late. He fell back quickly, but the tolling of the bell
		was rather frequent. It affected him more and more.</p>

	<p>Before Seven Spirit escaped from Heaven, his body fell completely into the dance. He couldn’t stop that strange
		dance, and he couldn’t get out of Heaven.</p>

	<p>Han Sen was so happy, and he kept slashing at Seven Spirit. Using Jadeskin and Mutant Blood, he began to leave
		shallow marks on the gold Buddha body.</p>

	<p>But that was enough. If he could leave marks, the Teeth power would slowly start to tear Seven Spirit’s body
		apart. Although it was slow, over time, it’d be enough for him to kill Seven Spirit and his Buddha body.</p>

	<p>Seven Spirit kept roaring with his four faces. He wanted to take control of his body and escape the Buddha
		Heaven, but his body had been hijacked by the music. Regaining control was a very difficult task.</p>

	<p>“Why is he not affected? Impossible…” Seven Spirit Buddha took another hit from Han Sen. His eyes gleamed gold,
		and he looked angry.</p>

	<p>Han Sen wanted to cut him a few more times before he left that place. When he exited, the marks would kill the
		felon slowly anyway. But before Han Sen could slash him again, Seven Spirit’s eyes suddenly turned gold. Gold
		fire flared to life, and it burst out to wrap up Seven Spirit’s body.</p>

	<p>The body that had been affected by the music suddenly became still, thanks to that gold flame. He had stopped
		dancing.</p>

	<p>“Han Sen, I said we would meet again soon.” The four-faced, eight-armed Buddha, which was enveloped in fire,
		opened its four mouths to speak. A scary voice boomed out.</p>

	<p>“Qing Jun!” Han Sen now knew who it was. The Sky God had been behind everything this entire time.</p>

	<p>Seven Spirit’s mind was completely under the control of Qing Jun. And in his true form, he was not affected by
		the bell. He cruelly laughed as he walked towards Han Sen. He said, “Han Sen, I have waited a long, long time
		for this. But don’t worry; I won’t kill you. You are a big delicious meal for one such as 1.1 will feast on your
		fear, your tears, and your death.”</p>

	<p>The voice of utter contempt echoed in Han Sen’s ears. Han Sen felt terrible, but he brought out the red mist orb.
	</p>

	<p>He couldn’t deal with Seven Spirit, and now it turned out that he was being possessed by Sky God Qing Jun. There
		was no way Han Sen could triumph now.</p>

	<p>Han Sen planned on using Red Mist King for his final bid. Although Red Mist King had barely any juice left in the
		tank, he’d kill Seven Spirit if he could land a hit on him.</p>

	<p>Qing Jung looked so mad as he flared with gold fire. His demonic presence was insufferably strong, and it made
		the four-faced, eight-armed Buddha body look even scarier. It was like he was going to eat people.</p>

	<p><em>Boom!</em></p>

	<p>Qing Jun lifted his finger and gathered up a swirl of hot flame atop it. The fire gathered up Seven Spirit’s
		Buddha light and flame powers. He used it only for a second, and Han Sen felt himself burn.</p>

	<p>The four faces looked to be filled with vile hatred. Qing Jun controlled Seven Spirit’s body. His fingers fired a
		gold flame towards Han Sen.</p>

	<p>But suddenly, a bag was hanging around Seven Spirit’s neck. The bag was incinerated by the gold fire. There was a
		yellow spell paper inside, and it was scorched.</p>

	<p>When it burned, a weird light came out of the ash and went to Seven Spirit’s forehead.</p>

	<p>“Argh!” Han Sen heard a scream. The scream came from Qing Jun.</p>
