    <p>
      Luo Haitang, who did not show much interest in Divinity’s Bout, went
      straight to the Martial Hall when the seventh match began. He was eager to
      watch the fight between Dollar and Jade Shura.
    </p>
    <p>
      Luo Li walked over to Luo Haitang, and with a serious look, asked him,
      “Sir? Is that Jade Shura the real Shura Queen?”
    </p>
    <p>
      Luo Haitang sat down and said, “If she isn’t the Shura Queen, then things
      will be much worse.”
    </p>
    <p>“Why is that?” Luo Li asked, confused.</p>
    <p>
      “If she isn’t the Shura Queen, then that means the Jade Shura have a
      second scary person,” Luo Haitang said calmly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Luo Li thought that made sense. The Shura Queen was already giving him a
      headache, but the prospect of a second individual like this would be worse
      for the Luo family.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Jade Shura family had many elites, whereas the Luo family had no one.
      Aside from Luo Haitang, none were strong enough to represent them.
    </p>
    <p>
      “I hope Dollar can kill Jade Shura. Even if she is not the Shura Queen,
      killing her should sort the problem out,” Luo Li thought. She didn’t dare
      say it out loud in front of Luo Haitang.
    </p>
    <p>
      Luo Haitang did not say anything. He simply watched the stream displayed
      upon the Martial Hall tablet, waiting for Dollar and Jade Shura’s match to
      begin.
    </p>
    <p>
      When it was time for the fight to start, Han Sen strode right into the
      battleground. Jade Shura hadn’t arrived yet, so there was a bit of a wait.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the entry time was almost over, Jade Shura made her appearance. She
      looked the same as she had before, clad in black armor. She had a pair of
      purple horns and a mask on.
    </p>
    <p>
      “She’s not the Shura Queen.” Luo Haitang frowned, as this was bad news for
      the Luo family.
    </p>
    <p>
      Han Sen checked out Jade Shura carefully. He had never met the Shura
      Queen, so he could not tell if it was really her before him.
    </p>
    <p>
      “The pros love to enter at the last second, don’t they? Does that make you
      look stronger or something?” Han Sen asked after she walked in.
    </p>
    <p>
      He didn’t care whether she entered early or late. He just wanted to find
      out whether or not she was the shura queen, judging from her response.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jade Shura coldly responded, “Isn’t it a good thing? It’s me being
      merciful, letting you live a little longer.”
    </p>
    <p>
      After hearing her speak, Han Sen was able to guess that it wasn’t the
      Shura Queen. With the Shura Queen’s age and manners, she wouldn’t have
      replied like that. Han Sen thought it must have just been some young shura
      lady.
    </p>
    <p>
      “If she is not the Shura Queen, she must at least be from Jade Shura,” Han
      Sen thought Then he said, “You are kind.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “I am not, but if you are willing to concede, you can walk away with your
      life,” Jade Shura said.
    </p>
    <p>
      Han Sen laughed and said, “You are confident. I wonder what your strength
      is really like.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Try me, and you just might find out.” Jade Shura gave a grunt. Then, she
      raised her hand and began to build up Falsified- Sky power in the cup of
      her palm. The crowd felt that they could almost see something there, like
      she was holding a mirage.
    </p>
    <p>Han Sen looked at the left hand she had raised and frowned.</p>
    <p>
      Jade Shura only had half of the Falsified-Sky Sutra, but still, the level
      of power she possessed seemed nearly perfect to Han Sen.
    </p>
    <p>Luo Haitang saw the problem, too, and he frowned.</p>
    <p>
      “How is that possible? Her Falsified-Sky power is like you! Did they get
      the second part of the Falsified-Sky Sutra?” Luo Li screamed, completely
      shocked. She couldn’t believe it.
    </p>
    <p>Luo Haitang shook his head and said, “No, she didn’t get it”</p>
    <p>
      “Then why is her Falsified-Sky power…” Luo Li couldn’t speak. Luo Haitang
      had the complete Falsified-Sky Sutra. That meant she was accusing him of
      something.
    </p>
    <p>
      Luo Haitang looked at Jade Shura’s left hand and said, “We possess the
      Falsified-Sky Sutra, but it was something we stole from a tomb belonging
      to the shura. And we need shura blood to practice it. That means it was
      originally a skill for the shura. Jade Shura bred with the shura for many
      generations, so their blood is probably completely shura now. But it still
      can’t be like the absolutely pure shura that cannot practice the
      Falsified-Sky Sutra. Jade Shura’s blood is strong enough to almost
      complete the Falsified-Sky Sutra, so she is scarier than the Shura Queen
      herself. If she really did come to own the complete version, there’s no
      telling how strong she might become.”
    </p>
    <p>“Can Dollar beat her?” Asking that made Luo Li feel guilty.</p>
    <p>
      Luo Haitang shook his head and said, “It’ll just be difficult, Her
      Falsified-Sky power is close to my level. Very few beings can block her
      attacks. Dollar will have to get rid of her before she strikes. Otherwise,
      I fear it is already too late.”
    </p>
    <p>
      Luo Li heard this and felt very anxious. Jade Shura had already gathered
      up her Falsified-Sky power while Dollar watched.
    </p>
    <p>He didn’t even seem interested in attacking her.</p>
    <p>
      “What is wrong with him? Does he not know the strength of Falsified-Sky
      power? What is he standing there for? Go kill her!” Luo Li felt a need for
      haste, but no matter how she felt, all she could do was watch.
    </p>
    <p>
      Many creatures shared the same feelings. Those who knew what Falsified-Sky
      powers could do were confused. They did not know why Dollar was refusing
      to attack.
    </p>
    <p>
      “That Dollar is conceited. He is waiting for Jade Shura to strike first,”
      Furnace Emperor said while observing Dollar.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Doesn’t he know that Falsified-Sky powers will not miss? If Jade Shura
      strikes, he’s a dead man.” Xu Mi looked on strangely.
    </p>
    <p>
      “True, but everything around this Dollar is weird. Perhaps he does have
      some power that can go against it.” Furnace Emperor was not entirely sure.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jade Shura saw Dollar unmoving, waiting for her to strike first. She
      looked annoyed, and she thought to herself, “If you want to die, then
      fine!”
    </p>
    <p>
      After that, she swung her hand. An invisible force came rushing forward to
      Han Sen. And everyone’s eyes traced it from her left hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      The strike was nothing beautiful. There was no light or ripple as it came,
      but people knew what the strike did, and they knew how frightening it
      truly was.
    </p>
    <p>
      Han Sen looked at Jade Shura’s left hand. Still, he did not strike. He
      just wanted to see how far she had come with her practice of the
      Falsified-Sky Sutra.
