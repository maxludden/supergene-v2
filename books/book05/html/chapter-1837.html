<h2>Zero’s Second Evolution</h2>
<h3>Chapter 1837</h3>

<p>Zero first generated her white geno armor, then underwent the
process a second time. There was no pause between the sequences.
Her geno armor simply melted and reshaped itself into a white
knife. It looked like a dagger made of bone.</p>
<p>As Han Sen found himself joyous in the realization that Zero
could evolve a second time, her bone knife suddenly cracked. It
gave him quite a shock.</p>
<p>“What is this? Why did the geno armament crack, all by itself?”
Han Sen did not understand. When he wanted to check on her and see
if she was injured in any way, the energy surrounding Zero changed
all of a sudden. Her black eyes turned purple, and then that color
of purple started to spread.</p>
<p>Quickly, Zero’s hair was overtaken by the purple dye. From her
head, two horns protruded.</p>
<p>“Zero! Are you okay?” Han Sen was worried, but fortunately, Zero
wasn’t wounded. She had simply turned into her shura-self.</p>
<p>When Zero became shura, a substance oozed out of her body. Then,
she began generating another geno armor.</p>
<p>“She can generate another geno armor? Aren’t her human and shura
bodies one?” Han Sen wondered to himself.</p>
<p>This was different. Zero’s geno armor had become purple, just
like her purple horns. The texture was similar between them both,
too.</p>
<p>The process was a success, just like it was last time. They
became geno fluid again, as well, but this time, it did not reshape
itself as a knife. It went right into Zero’s body.</p>
<p>“Xenogeneic?” Han Sen was worried. Zero’s situation was a
complicated one.</p>
<p>Through the first process, she became a Noble. This second time,
however, she was becoming a xenogeneic. Han Sen did not know how
that would ultimately affect her body.</p>
<p>The purple substance went into Zero’s body, and her whole body
showed changes. A purple smoke was emitted, and its cloud quickly
obscured Zero. Inside it, he did not know how she might be evolving
now.</p>
<p>As Zero was evolving to become a xenogeneic, far away in space,
inside a black hole, there was a man with purple horns practicing.
He opened his eyes and looked in the direction of Planet Kate. He
looked shocked, and then he frowned.</p>
<p>“Weird. Why did that feeling only last one second? Would any of
my heirs like that exist?” The man looked confused, as he couldn’t
feel anything anymore.</p>
<p>But the man cared little for it. With that thought lingering in
his mind, he continued his practice.</p>
<p>A man was standing on the roof of Han Sen’s abandoned building,
looking up into the sky. He seemed interested in something, and he
said, “Interesting. The creatures around that guy are interesting.
And he managed to get someone who was able to refine the deified
feather. And it wasn’t a Feather. And now, a person has emerged
whose power is able to wake up an elder. Luckily, I got here quick
and averted the trouble.”</p>
<p>Kong Fei had felt it when Little Angel refined the deified
feather. So, he teleported there to save Han Sen from a particular
crisis.</p>
<p>Han Sen was in the room, waiting for Zero to evolve. Kong Fei
was on the roof of the building, drinking alcohol. The space around
the building seemed different, but you couldn’t quite put your
finger on what that difference was.</p>
<p>Half an hour later, Zero’s purple mist cleared. Her face did not
seem to display much difference, and everything about her was still
purple. There was no visible difference now from before she had
transformed.</p>
<p>When Zero’s purple smoke had faded entirely, she looked like a
human again.</p>
<p>“Zero, are you okay?” Han Sen asked, looking at her body.</p>
<p>Zero shook her head. She summoned the white knife in her hand.
It was the bone knife she had generated.</p>
<p>“The knife is still here.” Han Sen was shocked. He thought the
geno armament had shattered after the cracking, but that did not
seem to be the case.</p>
<p>Zero nodded and shook her head again. She wasn’t really sure
what to say.</p>
<p>Han Sen knew she was not hiding anything from him, and that she
really did not know how to phrase what she wished to say. So, he
said, “We can talk about it later. Let’s go back to the ship for
now.”</p>
<p>Han Sen did not bring any more people with him this time. He
could bring many more, but he figured that this would be enough for
now.</p>
<p>Han Sen did not want to let Zero, Little Angel, and Little
Silver leave the building yet, in fear of something happening to
them. So Han Sen walked out with them. He walked around town and
recruited a few Kate, just in case his companions looked a little
too obvious and strange.</p>
<p>“Interesting guy.” The man on the rooftop watched Han Sen leave,
then he smiled and jumped back into space.</p>
<p>The city was in ruins. There were no more people to collect, and
after walking around. Han Sen realized there was nothing worth
hanging around for.</p>
<p>Cities like that, aside from ones where the Kate army had
gathered, were notoriously difficult places to find Barons. Even if
they had been there when the Feathers fell, they’d have been
recruited by others by now. They wouldn’t still be hanging
around.</p>
<p>When Han Sen’s group arrived at the ship, Han Sen noticed that
there was more life gathered around the ship than there was in the
rest of the city. Many of the Kate were in front of it, hoping they
could get on.</p>
<p>But Han Sen wanted to recruit Barons only, so they were all
stopped.</p>
<p>The people were begging profusely, right outside the ship,
hoping that those onboard would change their minds and consider
letting them on.</p>
<p>“Please take me away! I can do anything you want.”</p>
<p>“Please, at least take my child! Only she needs to be on!”</p>
<p>“Didn’t I tell you guys clearly? We are hiring people to develop
a harsh planet! Not even Barons might survive there, and you think
you guys will?” One of the workers tried to explain the matter to
the crowd, but the people outside did not quit their constant
begging.</p>
<p>Han Sen frowned as he walked forward. Icebird Duke saw Han Sen
had brought two little girls with him, and she frowned. She thought
the lady Han Sen had brought was stronger than an ordinary
creature. But it was just a Baron, so it was still practically
useless.</p>
<p>She wondered what Han Sen’s true purpose was. His stated reasons
had seemed rather flimsy. If Han Sen really wanted to recruit
people, he wouldn’t have come here. Now, seeing two pretty ladies,
Icebird Duke looked a little upset. She thought he had to be up to
something.</p>
<p>“Icebird Duke, did you recruit anyone?” Han Sen asked her.</p>
<p>“We have sixteen so far,” Icebird Duke said.</p>
<p>Han Sen was surprised. He thought it was too many. He hadn’t
thought there would be so many Barons there, either.</p>
