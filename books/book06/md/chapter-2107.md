  Pang! Pang! Pang!

Fairy Feather elder and the other Feathers looked on in disbelief. The rebirthing powers that were flying toward Angela and Andola smacked into the blue shield. They could not penetrate the wall of light, and they ricochetted off one after another like meatballs bouncing off a plate.

“Impossible! How can the rebirthing power be stopped like that?” Andola shouted at the top of his lungs. Angela was simply stunned into silence.

Fairy Feather elder and the Kings stared with gaping jaws. They had no reaction to give, for what they saw was absolutely insane. It was well and truly baffling.

The rebirthing powers had been blocked. Never in their wildest nightmares had they thought something like this could happen. Not even King class elites could do such a thing.

But the fact of the matter was plain to see. This was happening. The rebirthing powers were being blocked by the blue light wielded by Han Sen. And because of the blue shield’s ability to contain the rebirthing powers, the winged eggs could no longer detect the lifeforce of the brothers. With no alternatives available to them, they all chose to drift towards Han Sen.

Seeing that, Yun Changkong smiled. He was genuinely surprised by what he was witnessing, but pleasantly so. He knew about Han Sen possessing some sort of a shield treasure, due to the reports stating he had used it against the Night Ghosts during the wild chain of events that transpired on Planet Night Ghost.

Yun Changkong hadn’t seen it in person before, though. He only had second-hand accounts to go on. He did not know the powers were this effective, but above all, he did not know it could be used to block the passage of the rebirthing powers.

The envoys in Sky Palace were in sheer delight, as one might expect. Han Sen was representing Sky Palace, too, so it had made them incredibly frustrated to see Han Sen being relentlessly mocked.

“Han Sen’s not bad. But then again, that’s why he hails from Sky Palace.”

“I thought rebirthing powers were powerful. But now they’re being shielded so easily?”

“It looks like the tales about them were incorrect, and they were just fanciful exaggerations.”

Fairy Feather elder’s face had turned an abhorrent shade of green. He couldn’t speak under the crush of the painful shock he was experiencing. He had no clue what powers might have fueled Han Sen’s shield to do what it was doing. It boggled his mind that it was able to block the rebirthing powers.

Before they could even hope to form an understanding, though, the rebirthing powers were directly in front of Han Sen. A rebirthing power hit Han Sen’s geno armor and melted into it. It shone like a holy light in his armor, making him glow with a holy aura.

Pat! Pat! Pat!

Many rebirthing powers hit the Spell armor like snow, making the armor glow.

When every rebirthing power entered his system, Han Sen felt as if he was given a shot of adrenaline. His body was so alive, and power surged into each and every cell. It really did feel as if he was going to be reborn.

Han Sen cast The Story of Genes to absorb those powers and evolve his Spell armor.

The Spell armor was by far the hardest to level up. He gathered as much power as he could right now, because he wouldn’t be afforded a second opportunity.

Outside the shield, Angela and Andola flared their power as strongly as they could. But try as they might, everything they did was useless.

The Demon Bug Bai Sema blocked everything. The rebirthing powers could not detect them outside the shield, so they had no interested in going anywhere other than to Han Sen.

“Han Sen! You are cheating! Put away your shield!” Fairy Feather elder shouted.

Yun Changkong laughed and said, “Fairy Feather, the rebirthing powers go for the one whose abilities they prefer. Random chance it a factor too, of course. But this is not cheating. If Han Sen is cheating in your books, then why did you get those two to lower their level from King to enter this competition?”

Fairy Feather elder’s face turned red. He realized with frustration that Yun Changkong knew the true identity of the brothers.

“The rebirthing powers are distributed by the Pool of Rebirth. What do you think?” Yun Changkong looked at Fairy Feather elder and smiled.

“Well, well, I can only suppose that you are right. These matters should not be trifled with by us, and they should be exclusively sorted out by the individuals currently occupying the Pool of Rebirth. This will all depend on their abilities and their abilities alone. We are only here as spectators and nothing more.” Fairy Feather coughed and spoke at high volume.

Angela and Andola heard him, though. And they understood what he really meant. Andola punched the blue shield.

When Andola punched, the giant gold angel shadow moved with him to punch the shield, too. The gold fist struck the blue shield like a giant smacking a crystal bowl.

The shied looked like weak glass, but when the gold angel fist came into contact with it, it was the gold light that shattered. Andola’s fist bounced off, and the blue light was wholly intact.

Andola’s face warped into something horrid. He gathered up more power and kept punching alongside his gold angel.

The gold light shattered, but the shield remained untouched. Han Sen was inside it, calmly absorbing the rebirthing powers. His Spell armor was becoming brighter and brighter.

The Duke powers were unable to break the blue shield, and this shocked the Feather nobles.

Andola clenched his jaw. Then, his body started to vibrate with power. His angel wings spread open wide, while an orb of light began to mass between his hands.

That gold light was like a vortex swirling in his hands. The gold light became brighter and brighter, until it looked like lightning in his hands.

Judgment Angel Light was a forbidden skill because practicing the art was very dangerous. It was so strong that there was a fair chance of it damaging the caster. It was the strongest attack geno art, but not even the Feathers dared use it.

Andola and Angela were talented enough to bring their proficiency with it up to King class. They could be the strongest Kings out of all the Feathers.

Although they were only Dukes now, the Judgment Angel Light they were summoning would still be incredibly powerful.

Boom!

When that gold light reached its max size, Andola and his gold angel shoved it forward. The light looked as if it could destroy a galaxy as it streaked toward the shield.

Pang!

The gold light shattered like glass. The blue shield, on the other hand, was totally fine. Against its blue surface, the terrifying Judgment Angel Light was no more than a delicate glass arrow.

Many Feather elders and Dukes were shocked.

Angela roared and gave his big Judgment Angel Light to Andola. Andola looked scary as he cast the second Judgment Angel Light. He gathered up the strength of two people.

Boom!

A thick gold light came against the blue shield like a light of judgment that could destroy Earth.

But when the light came against the blue shield, it was the gold that broke again. Nothing happened to the shield. It was quite spooky.

Everyone stared at the shield in awe.

The strongest secret skill of the Feathers had been used by the brothers Angela and Andola, and it had proven useless.
