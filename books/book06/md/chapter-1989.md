On Sky Path Island, four different classes of people awaited their exam: Barons, Viscounts, Earls, and Marquises.

The most popular section today would be the Earl examination. Many Kings and Nobles had gone there, and the stands were very full. It made the other three look so quiet.

Many Barons and Viscount students went there to watch the exam, too. They went there for Lone Bamboo.

Han Sen was not afraid because no one took him seriously, anyway. Aside from Yu Jing and the people that had made a bet with him, no one would be anticipating the fight between Han Sen and Lone Bamboo.

When Lone Bamboo arrived, he was given the spotlight. People kept talking about him, trying to guess why he wished to participate in the exam. No one could guess the true reason why.

Many people looked in Lone Bamboo’s direction, which made it easy for Han Sen to get a glimpse of him, too. When he saw the man’s face, he looked surprised. He said, “That guy is Lone Bamboo?”

It was the arrogant man Han Sen had seen on the seventh floor of the White Jade Building.

Seeing the match roster, Han Sen found that he was one round behind Lone Bamboo. So, he sat on the sidelines to see what sort of power Lone Bamboo wielded.

Sky Palace students were strong, so it was no wonder that they were a famous high race. There were many strong representatives of the race there, and they all had amazing geno arts.

Han Sen had fun spectating, but not long after, he saw Lone Bamboo approach the arena.

It was not just Han Sen turning to take a look at Lone Bamboo. Everyone else was, as well. One corner of the arena became the center of attention for the entire place.

After a while, an Earl student from Sky Palace came to the arena. He went straight up to Lone Bamboo.

Everyone thought they could watch Lone Bamboo fight, but that Earl student came before the man and just grabbed his hand. With much excitement, he said, “Brother Lone Bamboo, I can finally see you! I have been a fan ever since I was small.”

The supposed fight turned into a meet between a fan and their greatest idol. After the Earl finished speaking, he forfeited the fight and left.

“Damn! He can do that?” Han Sen felt depressed.

The people next to Han Sen were even more depressed. Many of them were angry, even.

“That guy is too obscene! He knew he couldn’t compete against Lone Bamboo. He did this just so he didn’t have to embarrass himself.”

“It won’t go on like this, will it? With no one daring to fight him?’

“It is hard to say. Everyone knows Lone Bamboo’s strength. It does not matter if they fight or not, but perhaps someone arrogant enough will think they have the chops to challenge him.”

“Brother Lone Bamboo is so smart. He does not have to fight, and yet he can still win.”

Not much later, it was Han Sen’s turn for a reveal. He went towards the arena, but he did not draw much attention. Only a few people who knew Han Sen, or those that knew he got carried to Sky Palace, bothered to take a look.

Han Sen’s opponent was called Cool Jade. He was quite good amongst the Earls, but there were many good ones like that all across Sky Palace. Being decidedly average, he wasn’t very well-renown.

Yun Suyi could not help but watch Han Sen’s fight. Yu Jing had not dared show himself, as he was afraid he’d bump into the guys he had made the gambit with. If he went, he believed he’d be laughed at.

Yun Suyi just sat down, and she heard a few men talking.

“Since I’m so bored, I might as well see how strong this Han Sen is. Yu Jing sure compliments him enough.”

“It does not matter how strong he is. He’s going to lose to Lone Bamboo, anyway.”

“Don’t say that just yet. Maybe he will be killed before he even meets Lone Bamboo!”

“That’s right, haha.”

The few were chatting amongst each other, and it made Yun Suyi frown. When she was about to confront those voices, someone suddenly approached and sat down next to her.

“Brother Lone Bamboo?” After Yun Suyi saw who the person was, she was shocked.

Everyone looked at Lone Bamboo, and they were all shocked, too. Many women looked at him with the most charming faces.

“Why is Lone Bamboo here? Who is he watching?”

“There is nothing worthy of his focus here, right?”

“Of course there isn’t. None of the Earls here are worthy of his spectating.”

“Maybe he is here to watch a friend?”

“That is possible.”

“Would it be for Yun Suyi?”

“That is possible, too. Yun Suyi’s prettiness and talent are unequaled across all of Sky Palace. She wouldn’t be an embarrassment for Lone Bamboo.”

Yun Suyi, hearing that, frowned again. She looked at Lone Bamboo, and he looked down at the arena without any emotion.

Yun Suyi’s heart jumped, and she thought to herself, “Is Lone Bamboo here for Han Sen?”

There were many fights going on in the arena, and they were all going on at the same time. It was difficult to determine who he was watching.

Han Sen felt the stare coming from Lone Bamboo, though. Han Sen turned to take a look, and he saw Lone Bamboo looking at him. He thought to himself, “Why is he watching me?”

Cool Jade pulled out his longsword and swung it at Han Sen. The swordlight possessed a purple mist, and it seemed strong enough to sunder the ceiling.

Han Sen summoned Spell next to him, and he fired his pistols at Cool Jade.

Dong! Dong! Dong!

The munitions were continuously expelled, and Cool Jade’s longsword kept swinging around with its purple mist. It blocked a few bullets, but more hit his body and armor. He flew out of the ring and conceded defeat.

“Damn! What is that thing? Is that a geno armament?”

“It looks very strong.”

“A geno armament like that is better to watch than the fight itself.”

Han Sen’s victory didn’t draw much attention, ultimately. Some students were interested in Spell, more than Han Sen himself.

Han Sen put Spell away and left the arena.

Everyone looked back to where Lone Bamboo had been, and they noticed he had vanished. Yun Suyi, who had been next to him, was gone, too.

Now people knew they had guessed it right. He had gone there for Yun Suyi.
