    <p>
      Pat! The old man slapped Zhou Changlong across the face. His face
      immediately started to swell up, and his men froze in place.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Brother-in-law, why did you hit me?” Zhou Changlong stared at the old
      man, one hand pressed against his sore face.
    </p>
    <p>
      The old man said darkly, “Yes, I only hit you this time. Next time, I’ll
      kill you. It’s better than being killed by the others, ruining my
      reputation, and embarrassing your sister! You can be a bad man all you
      please, but don’t be a stupid one. Do you not know the daughter of
      President Ji and the super aristocrat when they’re standing before you?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “That is Han Sen and Ji Yanran?” Zhou Changlong’s face changed to one of
      disbelief.
    </p>
    <p>
      “How many times have I told you? You can be bad, yes, but you need to know
      the faces of those you insult. I asked you to remember all the important
      people in the Alliance, and you don’t even know these two prominent
      figures? D*mn you!” After saying this, the old man slapped Zhou
      Changlong’s other cheek until it was swollen.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Brother-in-law…” Zhou Changlong had once looked cruel and important to
      the assembly there, but before that old man, he was terrified.
    </p>
    <p>
      The old man simply ignored him, and then walked towards Han Sen. He eyed
      the young man up and down, and with each step, he looked as if he was
      carrying a mountain on his shoulders.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ji Yanran herself felt there was a monumental power approaching them. Han
      Sen stepped in front of Ji Yanran, and then that power was gone. She
      frowned. “Qiuming, your brother-in-law did something wrong. Are you going
      to take it out on us?”
    </p>
    <p>
      Qiuming, as he approached, responded coldly, “I will correct him when he
      does bad deeds. But I can’t allow him to be bullied by others, either.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “It’s no wonder you two are from Angel Gene. You’re both rotten,” Ji
      Yanran said angrily.
    </p>
    <p>
      Qiuming still held himself in a manner that suggested he was superior by
      default. “Because of President Ji, I won’t kill him. But I need him to
      know, like any dog should, that he should respect the whip of a master.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Dear, be careful! Qiuming has been a demigod for a long time. He might
      have a gemstone geno core,” Ji Yanran warned Han Sen in a hushed voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      Han Sen nodded. He had heard about Qiuming when he was researching
      demigods. He was not from the Zhou family, but for some reason, he was
      allowed to join Angel Gene. He was as mean a person as one could be.
    </p>
    <p>
      Zhou Changlong, who had just been slapped, now looked happy again.
      “Brother-in-law, teach that *sshole a lesson! Who cares if they are the
      daughter and son-in-law of the President?”
    </p>
    <p>
      Han Sen watched Qiuming quietly approach, initially believing him to be
      bluffing.
    </p>
    <p>
      As he walked, an armor of sorts appeared on his body. It looked sturdier
      than a mountain, and this mountain was coming close.
    </p>
    <p>
      “An earth-element geno core? Interesting,” Han Sen said as he watched the
      old man approach.
    </p>
    <p>
      Qiuming didn’t respond. He just quickened his pace and came towards Han
      Sen like an armored train.
    </p>
    <p>The power he wielded looked as if it could sunder mountains.</p>
    <p>
      Han Sen didn’t plan to dodge the attack, though. He simply threw his fist
      forward to meet with Qiuming’s.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Kill him!” Zhou Changlong yelled to the sky, seeing Han Sen raise his
      fist towards his brother-in-law.
    </p>
    <p>
      He knew the power Qiuming possessed, and he knew his geno core was
      gemstone class. It was called Heavy Earth Armor. When he battled the
      shura, his armor was strong enough to block blasts from their sun-class
      battleships without breaking.
    </p>
    <p>
      Qiuming had the highest defense in all the Alliance, and yet, Han Sen
      hadn’t been a demigod for very long. Taking a bash from the Heavy Earth
      Armor should have been enough to crush every bone in his body.
    </p>
    <p>
      Qiuming frowned. He only wanted to teach the punk a lesson, not kill him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Angel Gene and Han Sen had long been enemies. And while things might have
      been different in the sanctuaries, he wasn’t allowed to kill Han Sen in
      the Alliance.
    </p>
    <p>
      With Han Sen not dodging his bash, Qiuming was set-up to do serious
      damage. It also reinforced his belief in Han Sen’s arrogance.
    </p>
    <p>
      “You think I won’t dare hurt you? I’m going to cripple you! The Ji family
      won’t be able to save you now.” Qiuming’s eyes flashed with murder, and he
      came at Han Sen’s fist with greater force.
    </p>
    <p>Boom!</p>
    <p>
      The fist collided with the armor, and Qiuming’s train-like body came to a
      full-stop as if he had rammed head-first into an impenetrable wall.
    </p>
    <p>
      As the people surrounding the conflict watched, everything came to a
      standstill. Their ears rang with the simple sound of silence, as their
      eyes told them something most stunning.
    </p>
    <p>
      It hadn’t ended yet, though. The armor Han Sen had thrown his fist at
      began to web with countless cracks.
    </p>
    <p>Pang!</p>
    <p>
      The Heavy Earth Armor that could protect its wearer from sun-class
      battleship blasts shattered, crumbling to the ground in pieces.
    </p>
    <p>
      Zhou Changlong watched in shock as Qiuming’s body went flying far away. He
      broke through eight Rainflower Trees on his descent, then began heaving
      blood.
    </p>
    <p>
      “In my eyes, dogs are dogs. The only difference is their sizes. Big or
      small, there are no masters,” Han Sen said coldly. Then, he left with
      Littleflower and Ji Yanran.
    </p>
    <p>
      Zhou Changlong and all the workers were in shock. Qiuming had a godlike
      strength in their eyes, and they couldn’t believe what Han Sen had done to
      him in a single punch.
    </p>
    <p>
      The young couple were in shock, too, and they swiftly followed after Han
      Sen.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Han Sen, we knew you were the first super aristocrat in the Alliance, but
      I didn’t suspect you could destroy a demigod like that with such ease. You
      were able to take him down in a single punch. You are so strong!” The
      young couple spoke to Han Sen with fervent excitement, as the first-hand
      viewing of that punch instantly brightened their mood.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Why is he so strong? Is it because I don’t have a super geno core? But he
      didn’t even use one to break my Heavy Earth Armor!” Qiuming gritted his
      teeth as he lifted himself off the ground. His face looked pale as he
      watched Han Sen quietly walking away.
