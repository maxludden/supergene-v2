<p>One month passed. Han Sen left Rare Beast Island and returned
the tablet to Shi Beifeng.</p>
<p>“Brother Han, if you’d like, you can stay for longer. It is
okay.” Shi Beifeng had come to say goodbye to Han Sen, who was
going to leave the island.</p>
<p>“It’s okay. This month of hunting benefitted me greatly, and if
I was to stay any longer, I would only feel guilty.” Han Sen
pointed at the legless crane while he spoke.</p>
<p>The legless crane was loaded with xenogeneic genes, and when Shi
Beifeng had a look, he was shocked. Most of the xenogeneic genes
atop it were Marquise genes.</p>
<p>Given Han Sen’s reputation, it wasn’t strange that he could slay
Marquise xenogeneics as an Earl. The surprising thing was how many
he had killed within the space of a month.</p>
<p>Shi Beifeng wanted to be friends with Han Sen even more now, and
so he smiled and said, “Okay, but if you need anything, come and
look for me. The Shi family will always be willing to help
you.”</p>
<p>Thanks, Brother Shi.” Han Sen bowed and didn’t say anything
more.</p>
<p>The legless crane was carrying so many materials that it
struggled to get airborne. Shi Beifeng saw that there was no space
for Han Sen to sit on it, so he lent Han Sen a four-winged lion
mount. The loaned mount and the legless crane brought Han Sen and
the xenogeneic genes back to Jade Island.</p>
<p>Han Sen had earned a lot this time. He got a dozen Marquise
class xenogeneic genes and the Demon Stone Cow beast soul. He also
earned those little stones, and the stone statue that was near
them.</p>
<p>But Han Sen did not know what kind of xenogeneic gene those
little rocks were. He guessed they were Marquise class; otherwise,
he would have already absorbed them.</p>
<p>And in regards to the statue, Han Sen tried cleaning it, but it
made little difference. It was just grey, like ordinary stone.</p>
<p>The style of it was quite simplistic, so there wasn’t much
finesse to the carving. There were no engravings or words upon it,
either. It looked like a wildling statue, from some ancient
time.</p>
<p>Han Sen used his Dongxuan Aura to examine the stone statue, and
he thought there was more to it than met the eye. He couldn’t
determine exactly what was special about it, though. He only knew
that it was a Sky statue.</p>
<p>“Brother Han, you are back. I have missed you.” Han Sen had just
arrived home on the Jade Island, but before he could dismount, Yu
Jing rode over on his green dragon. They entered Han Sen’s home,
and Yu Jing grabbed Han Sen’s hands with passion.</p>
<p>“What do you want? Don’t touch me; I’m not gay.” Han Sen pulled
his hands away and wiped them down with a cloth.</p>
<p>He thought Yu Jing was looking at him queerly. It looked as if
the man was seeing some beautiful naked woman instead of Han
Sen.</p>
<p>“What? I would go for a Sky if I wanted to go gay. Why would I
come over here for you?” Yu Jing didn’t think that sounded right,
so he spat on the floor and went on to say, “No, I’m not gay at
all.”</p>
<p>After that, Yu Jing’s eyes kept wandering around Han Sen’s
house. He said, “Brother Han, I have heard you earned many things
from Rare Beast Island. Do you plan to sell the wares? If you sell
them to me, I can give you a good price.”</p>
<p>After that, Yu Jing saw a bunch of xenogeneic genes in the
corner of Han Sen’s house. His eyes widened, and after rummaging
through the genes for a minute, he said, “This is a Marquise class
Wind Tiger’s tail. This is a Bone Elephant’s tusk. Are all these
Marquise xenogeneic genes?”</p>
<p>“Almost,” Han Sen said casually.</p>
<p>“Very strong. To be able to kill Marquises as an Earl, well…
Very few of the Sky can accomplish something like that. Only you
and Lone Bamboo, as far as I know.” After that, Yu Jing came back
to Han Sen. He sat dowai at the table and poured himself some
water. He drank and said, “Have you heard that the Feather have
allied with Sky Palace? They are our subordinate race now. They
have sent many Nobles here to study.”</p>
<p>“That’s not strange. The Feather lost their position as a high
race, and they’re much weaker now. If they didn’t make new
alliances, they’d be brought to ruin. Holy Heaven is a large
xenogeneic space, and many of the other higher races want it. It
was just a matter of time,” Han Sen responded.</p>
<p>Yu Jing nodded and said, “That’s not the point. When the Kings
came here, they were very generous. Although people don’t respect
them very much, no one is going to turn down money. So, they are
living a good life here.”</p>
<p>After that, Yu Jing smiled at Han Sen and said, “Are you
familiar with a Feather named Angia?”</p>
<p>“No.” Han Sen shook his head, as his knowledge of the Feather
was truly limited.</p>
<p>“He is the son of one of the half-deified Kings. He is really
talented, and he is a student of Sky Palace. He is the leader of
the Feather students, and he is an Earl like you. He walked the
Road to the Sky and received compliments. He has been practicing
with the Earl students, and while he has not lost nor won, his geno
arts have proven themselves to be quite special.”</p>
<p>“What does that mean?” Han Sen asked, catching Yu Jing’s
tone.</p>
<p>“Before he fights, he presents a bottle of spring water from
Holy Heaven. If someone of Earl class can beat him with knife
skills, he will give them the spring water.” Yu Jing coldly laughed
and said, “Our Sky Palace students study knife skills, but we
aren’t renown for them. We mostly use swords. You are the only one
amongst us that is good with them. He is obviously provoking you.
How dare he, eh?”</p>
<p>After that, Yu Jing smiled and said, “But the heavenly spring
water is some good stuff. As long as you’re still living, cleaning
your wounds with that stuff will fix you up quick. It can save you
from even mortal injuries, as it is a treasure from Holy Heaven.
This guy is unlucky. You can go over, beat him, and help yourself
to the spring water. If you don’t need it, I can sell it on your
behalf.”</p>
<p>“Maybe if I have time. I need to practice in the White Jade
Building first.” Han Sen wasn’t really concerned about the implied
challenge, as dealing with the Feathers was not on his priority
list.</p>
<p>The next day, he practiced in the White Jade Building. There, he
saw Yun Suyi on the fourth floor. He thought about Under the Sky,
so he caught Yun Suyi’s attention. “I did some research on Under
the Sky. If you have the time, we can explore it further
together.”</p>
