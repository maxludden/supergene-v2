<h2>Intense Fighting</h2>
<h3>Chapter 1943</h3>

<p>Several tornados raged across the desert. They were searching
for Han Sen almost hungrily. When the tornados reached a specific
dune, it exploded and a person emerged. He went straight west.</p>
<p>“Amitabha!” Seven Spirit waved his white robe, and the tornados
retreated into his sleeves. He looked like a dragon with yellow
wings as he came after Han Sen.</p>
<p>Han Sen was running forward, and the shape of a yellow dragon
that was a few hundred yards long was giving chase. It looked like
a yellow vortex that wanted to suck him in.</p>
<p>Han Sen’s blood was burning. His Spell armor glowed with light.
Han Sen looked like a bird, soaring through the sky to avoid the
power of that tornado.</p>
<p>Seven Spirit emerged from the trailing tornado and threw his
palm forward at Han Sen. It turned into a golden, roaring lion. Han
Sen’s body responded like a phoenix. He borrowed strength from the
air itself to accelerate. His body performed a stunning arc to
neatly avoid the lion’s attack.</p>
<p>Seven Spirit clicked his fingers, and then the gold light turned
into the spirits of the Buddha kings. They all rushed forward to
attack Han Sen.</p>
<p>There was a dragon, a lion, a sheep, an elephant, a horse, a
bug, and even a fish. They were all different types of animals. The
dragon was powerful. The lion was intimidating. The sheep was
implacable. The elephant was strong. The horse was fast. The bug
was creepy. The fish was spiritual. They all possessed a different
power, and they all had an effective synergy with one another.</p>
<p>Han Sen borrowed the speed of the rabbit shoes to keep up with
Seven Spirit, but he didn’t dare fight him head-on.</p>
<p>A Marquise would be too strong. If Han Sen got hit, he could die
in a moment.</p>
<p>“Seven Spirit! I have no grudge with you. Why do you want to
kill me?” Han Sen shouted as he tried to hide from the scary
attacks being aimed at him by the seven spirits.</p>
<p>Seven Spirit’s desire to kill him was a grave issue. Even if Han
Sen escaped, it could pose trouble in the future if Han Sen didn’t
understand why Seven Spirit wanted him dead. In order to sort this
out, he needed to figure out what had inspired Seven Spirit’s
rage.</p>
<p>But Seven Spirit refused to answer. His finger kept making
spiritual markings. He kept creating Buddha light marks and
infusing them with a desire to kill Han Sen.</p>
<p>Han Sen saw Seven Spirit wasn’t going to answer, and so after
dodging the next spirit mark attack, he said, “I know! You must
really love Speechless. But Speechless loves me, and she wants to
have sex with me. That is why you’re mad, right?”</p>
<p>Despite what he said, Han Sen did not think that was the reason.
He just wanted to goad his nemesis into talking.</p>
<p>Hai’er kept saying Seven Spirit wanted to kill him because of
Speechless, but that made no sense to Han Sen. Speechless’ plan to
seduce him had backfired, but no matter how prideful someone was,
they could not kill a student of a half-deified elite over
something like that.</p>
<p>There must have been an important reason why Seven Spirit wanted
to kill him.</p>
<p>Seven Spirit heard Han Sen, though. With a look of fury, he
said, “Shut up! Speechless is not someone you can be allowed to
pollute.”</p>
<p>After that, Seven Spirit’s Buddha light shone. A giant Buddha
hand rose from his back, then began approaching Han Sen. The palm
had seven spirit marks, too.</p>
<p>Han Sen could see that the sky was now full of creatures,
raining down towards him. Seeing it made him feel terrible. The
seven spirits were scary, and he knew he’d be unable to dodge
them.</p>
<p>Han Sen’s eyes froze, then he ran in front of the Buddha horse.
When he did, he felt an impact shudder through his body and into
his own hand. Then he was sent flying.</p>
<p>Han Sen used Yin Yang Blast, and the impact of the horse’s hoof
sent Han Sen shooting off like a kite. He was flying far away.</p>
<p>Han Sen began running as soon as his feet touched the ground,
coughing blood as he went. His opponent was too strong. He had used
most of his power to deal with that force, but somehow, it had
still managed to damage his body. If he hadn’t been wearing his
Marquise armor, he would have been killed.</p>
<p>Seven Spirit did not have the power to keep using Buddha Hand.
The Buddha light dimmed, and he returned to pursuing Han Sen.</p>
<p>“Seven Spirit, it isn’t strange for a girl to fall in love. You
cannot change someone’s heart by force. Speechless thinks I’m hot.
She wants to be with me. Killing me is pointless, as I will always
be in Speechless’ heart. She’ll never forget about me,” Han Sen
said, as he made his escape.</p>
<p>Han Sen could not defeat Seven Spirit, but if he could make his
enemy mad enough to lose his cool, perhaps there was a chance of
pulling through.</p>
<p>Seven Spirit’s face turned green, and he said, “Shut up! Don’t
talk about her like that.”</p>
<p>Seeing that Seven Spirit really did care about Speechless, Han
Sen was delighted. He had to do what he could to live, so he said,
“Speechless and I are so in love. She mentioned you to me. She said
you were nice, but you are extremely boring. You don’t know how to
treat a woman. You don’t even dare to touch her fingers. You aren’t
a real man!”</p>
<p>Seven Spirit did not say anything. He kept casting his seven
spirits marks like mad. Han Sen had managed to gain some distance
from Seven Spirit, so they weren’t terribly close together. Han Sen
managed to dodge every attack, too, so there wasn’t as much of a
threat.</p>
<p>Seven Spirit knew this was pointless, so he stopped attacking.
He used his power to close the gap, instead. By doing that, he was
able to catch up quickly.</p>
<p>This guy is annoying!” Han Sen’s chest was rumbling, and he was
still coughing up blood. He was thankful he had his mutated blood.
He wasn’t losing as much blood as he would have otherwise, but he
could not heal.</p>
<p>“Seven Spirit, a man should be more straightforward. I only used
a little effort to make her come after me. I touched her body all
over, and you didn’t even touch her fingers. You are such a sad
man.” As he provoked Seven Spirit, Han Sen kept thinking about how
he could survive this.</p>
<p>“Shut up!” Seven Spirit was enraged. His Buddha light brightened
considerably, and then he used a thousand Buddha Hands.</p>
<p>This time, he did not use his seven spirit marks. He merely
pulled out a wooden instrument. He struck it, and the sky flashed
above them. Han Sen felt a rumble of thunder in his heart.</p>
<p>“Argh!” Han Sen felt electricity course through him. More blood
spilled from his lips, and he almost fell over.</p>
