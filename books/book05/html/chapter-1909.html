<p>Han Sen started running out of the lodge. The man might be lying, but it was better to run than risking everything by remaining. If Han Sen was transported to another star system, that’d be pretty bad.</p>

<p>When he made it some distance away, Han Sen turned around to face the man and ask, “What is your name?”</p>

<p>“Left Crazy,” the man answered.</p>

<p>Han Sen wished to ask something more, but he felt the mountain begin to shake. Without hesitation, he said goodbye and hastily departed the mountain.</p>

<p><em>Boom!</em></p>

<p>With the speed of his rabbit shoes aiding his flight, Han Sen was able to just about get off the mountain before hearing that deafening sound. The mountains all around were vibrating like mad, and when Han Sen turned back around to face where the mountain had been, he saw nothing. It was as if the mountain did not exist.</p>

<p>“How did that mountain move so quickly? I thought the man said that rocks were slow.” Cold sweat dripped off Han Sen’s forehead. It was fortunate he had moved as fast as he had. If he hadn’t, he’d have been long gone.</p>

<p>Han Sen took a gander at the book he had been given by Left Crazy. There was no name, and it had all been written by hand.</p>

<p>“Petrify? That sounds so lame. It sounds like a skill that can make your skin as hard as stone,” Han Sen thought, as he started to read the text.</p>

<p>But as he read, his expression turned to surprise. The skill was called petrify, and while the name was lame, the contents were impressive.</p>

<p>It was a complete geno art. From commoner to Baron, from Viscount to King, all could practice and become proficient with it. It had its own power.</p>

<p>Practicing Petrify did not make your body harder, though. It would just make your body closer to that of the rocky creatures. Grystallizers were like hurrmns, so they couldiVt become like rocks completely. “The higher your petrification was, the closer to the life of a rock you’d attune.</p>

<p>You wouldn’t become completely the same as a rock, you’d only adopt some of their attributes. Petrify made humans and crystallizers petrified. It gave them the life of a rock.</p>

<p>Petrify couldn’t make someone impervious to death, but time had more difficulty leaving its marks on petrified bodies. Thousands of years result in many humans and crystallizers dying, but to a rock, it was only a moment. It did not affect them.</p>

<p>Han Sen examined the requirements for bringing Petrify up to King class, if that was what he chose to do. At that point, he would have a life that was very similar to a rock’s. And with a body like that, many millions of years could come and go without affecting him.</p>

<p>There was one significant flaw to Petrify, though. When you used it, your body really would turn to stone. You’d be unable to move because of it. And your mind would still be there, active, too. The more you practiced the skill, the closer to the life of a rock you would get.</p>

<p>“It sounds really cool, but it seems fairly useless. You’d only turn into a rock, and rocks aren’t hard enough to provide great protection. And you can’t move, either. Why would that guy bother creating this skill?” Han Sen thought to himself.</p>

<p>After a while, Han Sen was able to come up with a useful application for it.</p>

<p>“If I can practice while petrified, then time would be of no issue for me. I could just keep practicing without eating or drinking.”</p>

<p>In that case, Petrify might be really useful. He planned to learn it, thinking it might come in handy.</p>

<p>Petrify was a geno art that allowed for the swapping of genes. It did not make your body better. You still needed a strength like The Story of Gene as a basis.</p>

<p>Han Sen thought it was a crystallizer geno art, so he used The Story of Genes to practice with it.</p>

<p>Han Sen found a safe cave to take refuge in, where he could practice Petrify. It was easier to learn than he expected. After casting it once, his skin started to feel rocky. Already, Han Sen could tell that he had learned the first tier of Petrify.</p>

<p>“Hmm, that was much easier than I thought it’d be.” Han Sen then moved on to try the second tier. It was a Baron class Petrify.</p>

<p>Han Sen finished Baron Petrify easily, too. He kept on going, and he realized that Petrify really was exceptionally easy to learn. He only spent two days practicing with it to get it all the way up to King class.</p>

<p>After reaching King class, he noticed Left Crazy had not written anything more. That was likely due to the fact he had yet to reach that level. He guessed that after the King level, you could actually become petrified.</p>

<p>Without a skill that would teach him how to proceed, Han Sen decided to try other things.</p>

<p>If he became a rock and was unable to return to a human form, then his life would be over.</p>

<p>“Why is it like that? According to Left Crazy, you had to reach a certain level before practicing such a skill. So, why did nothing stop him from reaching King class? Is it because of The Story of Genes?” Han Sen guessed a number of things, but he wasn’t sure enough to put stock in anything.</p>

<p>Han Sen tried using his Petrify, and he learned other geno arts could not be practiced as long as it was in use. That was because Petrify made a big change to the body. Geno arts for the human body were useless. Only The Story of Genes could run while he was in a petrified state.</p>

<p>“This geno art is so weird. Although it can take you to a very high level, its usefulness is practically nonexistent.” Losing interest in Petrify, Han Sen decided to return to practicing with the Dongxuan Sutra.</p>

<p>Han Sen remained in the mountains for an entire month. He fought and practiced with his Dongxuan Sutra a great amount. Dongxuan Sutra was on the precipice of breaking through, but it had yet to do so.</p>

<p>There were ten days left before the red mist spring erupted. After realizing this, Han Sen decided it was time to leave the mountains and head to the spring. His Spell Geno Armament required this spring so it could become a Viscount. He couldn’t afford to miss this opportunity.</p>

<p>Before long, Han Sen was right outside Red Mist Valley. There were hordes of xenogeneics wandering around, and it was clear they had all come there for the red mist spring, as well.</p>

<p>They all hung outside the valley. None of them had entered the mist yet. They were waiting for the spring to erupt.</p>

<p>Han Sen looked around. The xenogeneics there were Baron or Viscount. There were no higher level sorts.</p>

<p>Yisha told Han Sen that the red mist spring only worked for Viscounts. It would be ineffective on those of a higher level, so, there was no point in high class xenogeneics coming.</p>
