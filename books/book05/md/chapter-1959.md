Han Sen’s fingers flashed with gold. The sky suddenly lit up, as the golden lights became coins that rained down. They covered an area of a dozen miles.

Ordinary Viscounts would not have power such as that. At best, they could only encompass an area of a few hundred meters. But Han Sen had his Soul Armor boost right now. The shadow of the Four-Faced Eight-Armed Buddha lurked behind him, unseen. The Buddha light was inside Han Sen’s body, imbuing him with the power of a Marquise. That was how he was able to summon the big Dollar rain.

All the gold lights became coins, which landed across the Meka’s xenogeneic gene battle bodies. It was like the Meka had been hit with big chunks of metal, making them heavier.

The lower level xenogeneic gene battle bodies crashed to the ground. The bodies belonging to those of a higher level began to move slower.

“Amitabha!” Clear Sea King spoke the Buddha catchphrase, but he didn’t do anything. He went through the coinfall and came before Han Sen. He waved his sleeve like a cloud, trying to capture Han Sen inside it.

Han Sen didn’t dodge, though. His left-hand possessed a red mist, and it shone. A strong red metal body came out of it. It threw a punch towards Clear Sea King.

*Boom!*

A scary red mist light punched into Clear Sea King’s sleeve. The sleeve deflated and tore. The red light went through the sleeve, up and into his chest.

Clear Sea King started to bleed as his body was sent flying away. He went barreling down the street like a meteor, crashing into Battle King’s ornate house. He broke the palace-like construct in half.

Everyone watching was stunned. No one could believe that a King had been sent flying like that.

Han Sen was shocked, too. He used Clear Sea King’s mistake to give himself an advantage and opportunity. He didn’t expect that a less-than-one-percent release of energy could be so powerful that it’d knock a King class into the distance.

Han Sen didn’t spare much time thinking, though. Red Mist King picked up Han Sen and sprinted towards the teleporter.

There was a boom noise. All the buildings and xenogeneic gene battle bodies in front of Red Mist King were pushed away.

The Meka were still frozen, and not a single one of them moved. With Clear Sea King having been punched away, none dared step in Han Sen’s path.

A roar came out of Battle King’s house. Battle King was riding a giant, bear-shaped xenogeneic gene battle body forward, wanting to stop Han Sen and Red Mist King.

Battle King hadn’t expected something of this sort could happen. He thought that since Clear Sea King was right next to Han Sen, Battle King himself would only have to make sure his subordinates were in order. He hadn’t expected Han Sen to pose such a threat. Now it was too late, and Red Mist King was jumping into a teleporter alongside Han Sen, to disappear amidst the depths of space.

Battle King roared. His battle body broke the teleporter, but his anger was futile.

Clear Sea King came out of the rubble with lips caked in blood. He looked awful. He was injured, but most of all, he was angry.

Han Sen went back to the copper palace. He got out of Red Mist King’s hand, and Little Seven came out of Red Mist King’s heart.

That punch had consumed all of Red Mist King’s energy. There was only 0.01% of energy left now, and it hurt Han Sen to see.

Luckily, he had managed to obtain one hundred Galaxy Sand crystals. If he hadn’t gotten those, it would have been a grand loss.

Back on Planet Eclipse, Han Sen researched the Meka. He noticed that news concerning Dollar and Clear Sea King had spread far across the universe.

The Buddha and the Meka had put out an APB on Red Mist King and Dollar. If anyone could provide a lead that led to either of their capture, they would be handsomely rewarded.

Han Sen saw the rewards up for grabs, and fancied taking off his own head for Red Mist King to deliver.

The entire geno universe was talking about it, but they were mostly talking about Red Mist King.

People began talking about the last time Red Mist King had made an appearance. It became known that he was a rare Meka xenogeneic gene battle body, and that he must be King class.

But before that, no one had ever seen Red Mist King. Not even the Meka knew about him, which was fairly scary.

A mysterious xenogeneic gene battle body and a human named Dollar had managed to scam a King class Buddha and escape from Meka. It just didn’t sound possible.

Many creatures now hoped to find them, in the hopes of obtaining the rewards put up by the factions slighted.

The Buddha were in a major rush to find him, in particular. They had just lost Seven Spirit, and Speechless herself had been kidnapped. It was a divine insult. But after a long time of searching, no one was able to find out anything concerning Dollar and Red Mist King.

When Yisha heard that Dollar had appeared on Meka, she herself assembled a group to find out more. But they didn’t uncover anything, either.

Han Sen took the one hundred grains of Galaxy Sand to the Alliance. He planned on refining them while he practiced The Story of Genes.

Other geno arts could advance and achieve breakthroughs by simple practice, but The Story of Genes required some sort of external force.

Han Sen brought out the Galaxy Sand grains, but before he started refining them, he saw a blue shadow travel through the wall. It appeared like a phantom.

“Little Star, why are you here?” Han Sen was surprised as he looked at Little Star. Little Star had eaten many xenogeneic genes, and he was very talented. So, he had now reached the Alliance.

Little Star was very tame, and he was able to travel through materials. He had never entered a room without permission before, though.

Little Star’s sudden appearance in Han Sen’s room was very weird.

Little Star canceled its Starsea Travel, and it brought its shiny body right up to Han Sen. It was staring at Han Sen’s Galaxy Sand.

“You want this?” Han Sen then thought to himself, “Little Star’s original name was Starsea Beast. Galaxy Sand came from the Galaxy Dragon. Are they connected?”

Little Star nodded and started licking Han Sen’s face.

“Bringing this back here cost me a fortune.” Han Sen looked at the box of Galaxy Sand with regret.

But seeing the look on Little Star’s face, he didn’t want to reject its request. So, he took one out and coughed. “I’ll let you try one.”
