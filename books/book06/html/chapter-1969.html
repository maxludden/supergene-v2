<h2>Becoming an Earl</h2>
<h3>Chapter 1969</h3>

<p>The seventh floor’s Jade Air flowed out like a liquid. It hung
visibly in the air.</p>
<p>Han Sen used Petrify to turn his flesh into stone, so he didn’t
feel it very much when the Jade Air connected with his body. He
used The Story of Genes to absorb the Jade Air.</p>
<p>Thousand Feather Crane, Yun Sushang, and First Day all turned to
look at Han Sen. The average Earl couldn’t withstand the seventh
floor’s Jade Air, and Han Sen was just a Viscount. It was likely he
would turn into a jade statue. Thousand Feather Crane prepared to
carry Han Sen out the moment he looked like he was in trouble.</p>
<p>But the three of them were shocked when Han Sen petrified
himself. The Jade Air didn’t affect Han Sen’s body much, and as
they watched, Han Sen began to absorb it. That was surprising.</p>
<p>“What is that geno art? It can allow a Viscount to withstand the
Jade Air on the seventh floor?” Yun Sushang was in shock.</p>
<p>Thousand Feather Crane stumbled slightly as he answered. “It
looks like some sort of petrifying geno art, but no matter how
strong it is, it shouldn’t be this effective on a Viscount. That
geno art cannot be a simple petrification. It must be a geno art
Knife Queen gave him.”</p>
<p>The three did not observe Han Sen for long. They were still
curious, but they needed to focus on their own practice.</p>
<p>The seventh floor’s Jade Air could not harm Han Sen while he was
petrified. After he used Petrify, his body had great compatibility
with Jade Air, so it was easy to absorb.</p>
<p>The Jade Air rushed into Han Sen’s body like water. He cast The
Story of Genes in the hopes he would break through with it.</p>
<p>Spell Armor automatically appeared around Han Sen’s body and
wrapped him up. The armor shone with a weird light, and mysterious
symbols appeared across it. It was scary.</p>
<p>The other three saw the movement around Han Sen, and when they
looked at him, their shock deepened. “He’s going to become an Earl
here?”</p>
<p>Han Sen had eaten a lot of grains of Galaxy Sand. He had already
been on the precipice of becoming an Earl, but he had lacked a
trigger.</p>
<p>The Jade Air would finish what the Galaxy Sand had started.
Galaxy Sand was a concentrated xenogeneic gene essence, and it
could be absorbed right away.</p>
<p>Jade Air was like ore, though. It had to be worked and refined
before absorption.</p>
<p>When ordinary Nobles absorbed Jade Air, most of it would be
wasted and released back into the room. Only small amounts of the
Jade Air would actually be absorbed and processed by their
bodies.</p>
<p>The Galaxy Sand could be used by low-tier Nobles without
side-effects, so it was okay for him to have used as much as he
had. But receiving too much Jade Air at once could damage a
person’s body.</p>
<p>Luckily, Han Sen did not want to absorb the Jade Air. He just
wanted to use the power of the Jade Air to break through. It did
not matter if it was refined or not; he just needed the strength of
it.</p>
<p>The Jade Air on the seventh floor was strong enough. Waves
battered across the threshold of his body, activating the power
Spell possessed. It had managed to kickstart the evolution process
of him becoming an Earl.</p>
<p>The mysterious Spell armor began to shift and change constantly.
Thousand Feather Crane observed the armor’s behavior, but he was
unsure what it signified.</p>
<p>When the symbols of Spell became brighter, it was as if the
light was coming to life. It came out of the armor, surrounding Han
Sen like a group of fairies.</p>
<p>“This is a text spirit. It is like the spirit of our Textless
Book. It is a very rare spirit!” Yun Sushang exclaimed, looking at
Spell.</p>
<p>“It’s rare, but the Rebate don’t have a geno art like that. What
geno art has he been practicing?” Thousand Feather Crane said with
a frown.</p>
<p>“No matter what it is, this guy is not as simple as what meets
the eye. It is very interesting.” Yun Sushang looked at Han Sen
with interest.</p>
<p>First Day looked at Han Sen with curiosity. “Brother Crane, the
geno art Han Sen is practicing… How is it when compared to that of
the Textless Book?”</p>
<p>Thousand Feather Crane shook his head. “I have not practiced
with the Textless Book, and I do not know what Han Sen’s geno art
is. It is difficult to tell, but the Textless Book is a skill
belonging to Sky Palace. It would not be weaker than any other geno
art. You have practiced Truth Spell, and that comes from the
Textless Book. And it is a spirit that creates text, so you should
know more about it than I do.”</p>
<p>Yes, First Day. Do you think your spirit is weaker or stronger
than his?” Yun Sushang asked First Day.</p>
<p>First Day looked very shy, and he said the Buddha catchphrase.
“I don’t understand his text, but it feels like it is deeper than
my own spirit.”</p>
<p>Yun Sushang and Thousand Feather Crane were shocked to hear
this. The Textless Book was a skill not every one of the Sky could
use. It had many requirements for its practice. So, while Yun
Sushang and Thousand Feather Crane were smart, they were still
unable to practice with it.</p>
<p>Although only a few could use the Textless Book in its original
form, there was a senior inside Sky Palace that had extracted a
part out of it that everyone could practice. It was called Truth
Spell, and even the ordinary Sky could use it.</p>
<p>While Truth Spell was just a small part of the Textless Book, it
was strong enough to be on par with other famous geno arts. First
Day was very good with it, and his talent was plain to see. If he
felt this way, then it meant Han Sen’s geno art had to be very
strong.</p>
<p>When Han Sen evolved, Spell’s spirit became stronger. While the
symbols spun around, a vortex was created. It absorbed the Jade Air
ravenously, draining the power into Han Sen’s body.</p>
<p>Pang!</p>
<p>A symbol shattered, and the others that were flying around him
blew up like a load of firecrackers. They were all broken.</p>
<p>Thousand Feather Crane and the others were shocked. They thought
Han Sen had failed, but then, a giant Spell body appeared behind
him. It was protecting him.</p>
<p>Pang!</p>
<p>That Spell broke, too. The fragments became a number of smaller
Spells, which landed on the armor. Then they disappeared.</p>
<p>Thousand Feather Crane was shocked, and Han Sen didn’t know
whether he had succeeded or failed. But quickly, an impressive
power started to radiate from Han Sen. When the others saw it, they
knew for certain that Han Sen had succeeded in becoming an
Earl.</p>
<p>“Spell Battle Body has become an Earl.”</p>
<p>The voice echoed through Han Sen’s mind, filling him with joy.
After much hard work, The Story of Genes had been brought up to
Earl.</p>
