<h2>Watching a Ceremony</h2>
<h3>Chapter 1926</h3>

<p>Fortunately, now that he was a student of someone who was
half-deified, Han Sen had some level of authority across Narrow
Moon. It gave him access to information that the ordinary Rebates
were not permitted to know.</p>
<p>Han Sen could not find out anything about the origin of the red
mist orb, but he was able to learn about the red mist minks and the
Red Mist King.</p>
<p>In the geno universe, there was a race called Meka. In truth, it
wasn’t one fixed race, but a title that included a number of
subspecies and different blood lineages. So, because of their
extreme diversity, the Meka couldn’t be considered a higher race
like the Feathers were. Even if their strength exceeded that of
some higher races.</p>
<p>Even if one of the Meka managed to light a geno lantern, it
wouldn’t be enough to enable all Meka to be considered a higher
race; there were too many differences in the blood between them
all.</p>
<p>The Meka’s xenogeneic space included everything from pigs to
snakes. There were still so many different types of creatures that
were considered Meka that it was difficult to keep track of them
all.</p>
<p>But there was one connecting thread, and that was a talent
shared by all the Meka. They could consume xenogeneic genes and
create a new material inside their own bodies.</p>
<p>The Meka used these materials to create xenogeneic battle
bodies, creations that were similar to the Red Mist King.</p>
<p>But in order to be used, xenogeneic battle bodies required a
power that belonged solely to the Meka. So, if you were not one of
the Meka, and you had a xenogeneic battle body, you would not be
able to operate it.</p>
<p>“Without a doubt, those little minks belong to the Meka. They’re
related in some way, leastways. But if that’s the case, then why
were they born here? And why was the Red Mist King here? The Meka
need a lot of xenogeneic genes to create xenogeneic battle bodies,
and the red mist spring had a lot of spring water. That means many
xenogeneics died here. These two have to be related in some way,”
Han Sen thought.</p>
<p>But this was all he could conjecture. He couldn’t make any
further guesses, as the information he had discovered did not talk
about the red mist minks and the Red Mist King specifically.</p>
<p>Han Sen tried to use xenogeneic gene ingredients to fill up the
Red Mist King’s energy, but he soon realized that it wasn’t
working.</p>
<p>This was because xenogeneic genes had to be eaten by the red
mist minks, who would then release the energy they had gained. That
was the top-up process for the Red Mist King. The red mist minks
were too small right now, however, so they couldn’t eat much. And
they were also slow to generate energy.</p>
<p>Han Sen let them eat as many Baron xenogeneic genes as they were
capable. But by doing so, they were only able to generate 0.01%
percent of the needed energy each day. And that was with all seven
of them working together. God only knew how long it would take for
the batteries to fill up.</p>
<p>Han Sen discovered that Red Mist King’s planet—the one they had
gone to—belonged to the Meka’s xenogeneic space. Red Mist King’s
arrival had been a big event for the Meka, and there was a lot of
news coverage on it.</p>
<p>Han Sen was happy he had managed to get out of there quickly. If
the Meka King class sorts found him, he didn’t know if he could
have made it out alive.</p>
<p>Planet Eclipse had been quiet for a while. After a few days,
Black Steel sent him a message inviting him to Planet Black- Moon
to observe a ceremony. The ceremony was about forging a knife. The
knife was forged already, so this was more of an opening ceremony
for the weapon.</p>
<p>The Black family wouldn’t invite others if it was an ordinary
knife, but this was different. Black-Moon King had spent a hundred
years to forge a King class knife. And that was why he wished to
arrange a ceremony that others could attend.</p>
<p>Not just anyone was qualified to watch, either. Most of the
invites were sent to King class elites. A few lower level
subordinates could follow after their Kings, but they weren’t
allowed to be there when the ceremony was taking place.</p>
<p>No other Viscounts like Han Sen received a direct invitation,
and only three or four Dukes received a direct invite. They were
Black-Moon King’s friends.</p>
<p>Although Han Sen was not particularly interested in attending a
ceremony, Yisha told him that Black-Moon King was going out of his
way to include Han Sen. Black-Moon King had always spoken
positively about Han Sen, so he had no qualms in agreeing to the
invite and going.</p>
<p>On the day of the ceremony, Black-Moon King called for a
spacecraft to collect Han Sen. Yisha also received an invitation,
but she wasn’t going, so Han Sen had to go alone.</p>
<p>When he reached Planet Black-Moon, Black Steel invited Han Sen
to join him in watching the ceremony. Han Sen realized he was
sitting in the same spot Yisha was supposed to.</p>
<p>That also meant he was sitting next to Moon Wheel King and a few
of the other Kings. Rebecca and Qing Li could only stand someplace
in the back, as they hadn’t been honored with seats.</p>
<p>Han Sen wasn’t very concerned about the situation, though. He
had seen too much in his lifetime, so paltry things like social
awkwardness no longer bothered him. He simply acted cool while he
drank his tea. He wasn’t unnerved by the proximity of Moon Wheel
King and the others.</p>
<p>But the Kings took tiers seriously. To them, Han Sen was a small
fry, so there was no need to converse with him. That meant no one
talked to Han Sen.</p>
<p>Half an hour later, no one had yet seen Black-Moon King or the
King class weapon he was supposed to present. Just as Han Sen was
wondering when the event was going to begin, Black-Moon King
appeared atop the peak of a stone mountain.</p>
<p>Han Sen was surprised, and he thought, “I thought this was a
ceremony. What is he doing up a mountain?”</p>
<p>Moon Wheel King smiled and said, “That stony mountain is a
whetstone. It is a xenogeneic gene from a King class rocky giant. A
long time ago, a King of the Black family slew it. And ever since,
they have used it as a whetstone. When a King class weapon is
forged, it is revealed here. This is the third time I have seen
this.”</p>
<p>“Are King class weapons that hard to forge?” Han Sen was
shocked. The Black family had a long history, but after all that
time, they had only managed to forge three?</p>
<p>Moon Wheel King smiled. “Not exactly. The Black family has
forged more than three King class weapons, but those were mostly
created from creatures. They don’t show them off. Only King class
weapons that are created entirely by the Black family’s hands will
have a ceremony.”</p>
<p>After a while, Moon Wheel King said, “This ceremony is special.
Black-Moon King is taking this very seriously. The weapon is named
after Narrow Moon.”</p>
<p>Han Sen was curious about this. He wondered what sort of knife
would be granted the title of Narrow Moon. Narrow Moon was as big
as the Rebate themselves were. The blade had to be special to be
named after it.</p>
