<p>A small business ship was flying through the expanse of space, following a designated route. Suddenly, the crew saw a woman approaching their vessel. The ship came to a stop and opened its doors to let her in.</p>

<p>The woman quickly entered the ship, and not long after, she was given a private room.</p>

<p>Inside that room, the Feather woman began to change her form. Her Feather features started to fade away. A white tail grew from her backside, and her body became curvier than ever. Her face underwent a change, too, becoming sharp and refined.</p>

<p>The beautiful woman then pulled a cubic object out of her pocket. It was the Very High mark that had manifested when she made it look like she had condensed a Destroyed.</p>

<p>The woman threw the Very High mark on the floor, and the Very High mark started to shake. It rattled around for a while until a pang noise sounded. A fox-like woman with fox ears emerged. She looked exactly the same as the other beautiful woman, save for the fact that she was quite a bit younger.</p>

<p>The fox woman scratched her bum and then got up. She snickered happily. “Sister, we made it! We managed to fool all of those people.”</p>

<p>If Dia Robber had been there, he would have been very angry. Killing the Destroyed Duke with a Very High mark had been merely a ruse. The shapeshifting foxes had outwitted everyone with their illusions.</p>

<p>It was a shame that the King class elites had been stuck outside the Six Star xenogeneic space. If they had been able to observe the foxes’ tricks with their own eyes, they’d have known what was up.</p>

<p>But the King class elites were forced to watch from a distance. The two fox sisters had counted on that, putting on a show that would only fool Dukes and Marquises.</p>

<p>“I told you. All those races might pretend to be tough shit around us, but they grovel like worms before the Very High. Seeing the Very High mark nearly scared them to death. They didn’t dare stay long enough to find out the truth.” Big sister Bai Lin smiled.</p>

<p>Little sister Bai Fu pulled out her pink tongue and said, “Luckily, those guys were restricting each other and thought it best not to allow the King class sorts to enter the Six Star xenogeneic space. Had this not been the case, we wouldn’t have been able to fool them. So, what do we do next?”</p>

<p>“Let’s become Ipo. We can head to Planet Ipo, then visit the Dragon after that…” Bai Lin trailed off and her eyes widened. There was a punch headed for them. It shot their way like a laser, destroying the ship in the process.</p>

<p>White light covered the two sisters as they escaped from the ship. A proud-looking woman hovered in space near the wreckage, looking at them coldly.</p>

<p>When the fox sisters saw the woman, they looked even more frightened. It was the powerful woman they had seen inside the Steel City restaurant.</p>

<p>They had never expected that the woman would manage to escape the locked-down planet, pursue them, and catch up with them before they got too far away from the system.</p>

<p>“Give me the Destroyed Bible,” the woman said flatly, staring at the sisters.</p>

<p>“I don’t have a clue what you are talking about. How could we have the Destroyed Bible?” Bai Lin laughed.</p>

<p>The woman’s expression did not change. She just remained where she was, staring at them. Slowly, she said, “You and Toxic Dragon Old Six performed well. But now I’ve caught you, and I won’t allow you to deliver the Destroyed Bible to the Dragon. I will give you one last chance to hand it over.”</p>

<p>That woman then raised her fist. An overbearing power began to gather around it.</p>

<p>“You are strong, but you are alone. There’s no guarantee you can catch up with us, either.” Bai Lin frowned.</p>

<p>“Why don’t you test that theory?” The woman launched her fist right at Bai Lin.</p>

<p>Bai Lin and Bai Fu moved, and their bodies seemed to disappear in the black of space. They soon realized that no matter how they attempted to evade that strike, they wouldn’t be able to escape the punch.</p>

<p>It was as if the woman’s fist was coming from every direction at once. They were locked in. And while they could often survive dangerous situations by changing their race to hide in place sight, that skill wouldn’t help them in this situation. This punch wasn’t something they could avoid.</p>

<p>Pang!</p>

<p>Bai Lin and Bai Fu amassed and combined their power to fight back against that incoming punch, but they both ended up being hit. They were launched through space, with trails of blood drifting away from them. They crashed into an asteroid, and the asteroid broke into fragments.</p>

<p>Their amazing talents had allowed them to survive many attacks from a wide array of Dukes, but they weren’t Dukes themselves. They had the power of Marquises.</p>

<p>Bai Lin recovered from the blow and gritted her teeth. Her chest began to flicker with a formation of black light. The black light swept down to her fist, and she flashed forward to punch the enigmatic woman.</p>

<p>If the Destroyed had been there, they would have identified the black light as a power of the Destroyed Bible. No one could have guessed how Bai Lin was using her shapeshifting to cast the Destroyed Bible’s power, though.</p>

<p>Pang!</p>

<p>Despite the power of her attack, Bai Lin was sent flying away again. She curled slightly in pain after using the Bible, and her expression seemed stunned. “Is this… Did you just throw an Extreme King Punch?”</p>

<p>The woman was not inclined to answer, and so she raised her fist once more.</p>

<p>Bai Lin clenched her jaw again, then coughed from deep in her chest. She spat out a black light, which floated through space near her enemy.</p>

<p>“That’s for you,” Bai Lin sneered. She started pulling Bai Fu away from the area. “Let’s go.”</p>

<p>The Extreme King woman frowned as the two flew off. Their power was only average, but they were very quick. The Extreme King woman seemed hesitant, but she moved over to examine the black light.</p>

<p>The black light before her was actually a black stone book. It looked old, and the cover was adorned with a triangular symbol. There was nothing else remarkable about it. It was crude and worn, and it looked like the work of an older race.</p>

<p>Most people wouldn’t have known that the old stone book was actually the prestigious Destroyed Bible.</p>

<p>The Extreme King woman knew what the object was the moment she saw it, though. Although her race was one of the most important and powerful in the universe, the Extreme King’s resources were actually quite limited. Deified treasures like the Destroyed Bible were difficult to come by.</p>

<p>Securing the Destroyed Bible was the woman’s first priority. After that, she would go and finish off the two fox sisters.</p>

<p>The woman had almost touched the Destroyed Bible when she stopped. She frowned and looked at the Bible. It wasn’t actually floating in space as she had originally thought.</p>

<p>“Come out!” The woman stared at the Bible coldly.</p>

<p>In response to her shout, a shadow appeared right next to the Bible. Then a gold-armored hand reached out and grabbed the book.</p>
