    <p>
      Yin Yang Blast that Han Sen had practiced for a long time was eventually
      put into use.
    </p>

    <p>
      Yin Yang Blast invented by Professor Bai was a method to use strength, and
      it could be used by people of any status.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen&#8217;s conversion rate of the yin force had reached over 95%.
      Initially, he thought it might take some extra work to get rid of Tie Yi.
      After all, the yin force could not hurt Tie Yi when his limbs were hit.
      Only when Han Sen hit Tie Yi where the inner organs were located could Han
      Sen manage to injure the vulnerable organs.
    </p>

    <p>
      However, unexpectedly, Tie Yi was so confident in his fitness and Super
      Diamond Body that Tie Yi did not try to block Han Sen&#8217;s punches at
      all, which saved Han Sen a lot of trouble.
    </p>

    <p>
      Since it was merely a contest, Han Sen did not have any murderous
      thoughts. Otherwise, if he hit Tie Yi&#8217;s head, Tie Yi would at least
      become an idiot if he was not killed.
    </p>

    <p>
      However, Tie Yi was not to blame for his negligence. In such an
      interstellar era where efficiency is everything, there were few people
      willing to spend time and energy to practice the yin force. In addition,
      even fewer people could succeed.
    </p>

    <p>
      Normally speaking, an evolver could greatly improve their ability to fight
      no matter what hyper geno art they practiced. For example, Thunder Knife
      that Han Sen had received but did not have time to practice yet could show
      obvious effects in a short amount of time.
    </p>

    <p>
      However, the practice of the yin force not only needed a lot of time, but
      it did not help as much in improving one&#8217;s ability to fight.
    </p>

    <p>
      In the very beginning, it would be commendable if the yin force could
      penetrate 1 inch with a low conversion rate. In terms of hunting large
      creatures, one&#8217;s ability to fight was not enhanced, but weakened.
    </p>

    <p>
      For larger creatures, even their skin would be more than 1 inch thick.
      With the yin force, one could not even penetrate their skin. In the
      meantime, one&#8217;s force was reduced by almost half. So, this skill was
      completely useless. And frankly, it sucked.
    </p>

    <p>
      There were few people who practiced the yin force and even fewer who
      succeeded. Tie Yi had such a great fitness that even his inner organs were
      tough enough to endure hits above 100. If his opponent were not Han Sen,
      but someone with a fitness index just over a hundred, the yin force would
      not really hurt Tie Yi if the conversion rate was under 95%.
    </p>

    <p>
      A conversion rate of 80% was quite rare already. Tie Yi had never seen
      such powerful yin force before in his life, so he did not think Han Sen
      had any way to hurt him in the first place.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen repeatedly punched Tie Yi, hurting his inner organs secretly. The
      yin force could not be detected easily, and it was completely normal for
      someone to feel pain under strong strikes, which was why Tie Yi did not
      pay any attention.
    </p>

    <p>
      After Tie Yi used his force, his injured inner organs collapsed. That was
      why Han Sen told him not to move. If Tie Yi went to the doctor directly,
      the consequences will not be very severe.
    </p>

    <p>
      However, Tie Yi still tried to attack, which worsened his injuries in
      inner organs. Without resting for several months, he would not be able to
      get up again.
    </p>

    <p>
      The doctors from the medical team quickly carried Tie Yi was turning up
      the whites of his eyes away, leaving Han Sen enjoying the cheers and
      applause alone on the stage.
    </p>

    <p>
      No one had imagined that the invincible Tiger of Blueblood was defeated
      like that, in such an unimaginable way.
    </p>

    <p>
      Tie Yi&#8217;s choice to let Han Sen hit him was seen as a sign of
      ignorance and arrogance, while Han Sen became the hero and glory of the
      southwestern galaxy overnight.
    </p>

    <p>
      Many real masters were astonished by Han Sen&#8217;s performance.
      Naturally, they could tell that Han Sen was hurting Tie Yi&#8217;s inner
      organs with the yin force. However, the Super Diamond Body that Tie Yi
      practiced had an effect on enhancing his inner organs although it was the
      first stage. Without the strength of over a hundred, even yang force could
      not hurt Tie Yi&#8217;s heart directly, let alone the yin force.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen had a fitness level around a hundred and ten. The fact that he was
      able to beat Tie Yi like that indicated his incredible talent in
      practicing the yin force.
    </p>

    <p>
      With numerous advanced officers present, among whom many were surpassers,
      no one dared to say that they could use the yin force better than Han Sen.
    </p>

    <p>
      Many surpassers looked at Han Sen with more respect. A young man who could
      endure the boredom to practice the yin force so well was in no way an
      ordinary person. His perseverance and insistence were all what it took for
      people to remember his name.
    </p>

    <p>
      The last fight was between Zheng Yuze and Han Sen were competing for the
      title of Southwest Soldier King. the fight for the third place was
      canceled because of the serious injury of Tie Yi.
    </p>

    <p>
      It did not cost Han Sen much effort to beat Tie Yi, which made it easier
      for Han Sen to fight Zheng.
    </p>

    <p>
      Zheng Yuze had a fitness level similar to Han Sen&#8217;s when Han Sen
      used all the methods to improve his fitness. In addition, Zheng Yuze was a
      good fighter, so he would not be careless in front of Han Sen who had just
      beaten Tie Yi senseless. Zheng Yuze was very careful and took the defense
      position in the beginning, trying to beat Han Sen who had already fought
      once by consuming his energy, which showed his respect to Han Sen as well.
    </p>

    <p>
      This way, Han Sen had the perfect opportunity to fully demonstrate the
      skills that he had learned.
    </p>

    <p>
      Seven Kill, Double Blade, Diversion and other skills were so great that
      the soldiers were all bedazzled, applauding louder and louder.
    </p>

    <p>
      In the eyes of the true masters, Zheng Yuze had lost from the very
      beginning.
    </p>

    <p>
      The two persons had similar fitness, or maybe Zheng Yuze was even
      stronger. However, in terms of the cultivation of martial arts, Han Sen
      was obviously on a much higher level. Zheng Yuze was completed following
      Han Sen&#8217;s lead. He could only act passively, without any hope to
      win.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Nowadays less and less young people are truly dedicated to martial
      arts. Most people only focus on the skills instead of the arts.
      That&#8217;s why they never reach a high level. This Han Sen is very good,
      looking like a true master. He will have a great future for sure,&#8221;
      said the chief with approval.
    </p>

    <p>
      The secretary smiled wryly inwardly. The more the chief liked Han Sen, the
      bigger his mistake was.
    </p>

    <p>
      However, after being criticized by the chief, the secretary had realized
      that he should stop covering up his mistake, but face it to avoid similar
      mistakes in the future.
    </p>

    <p>
      Without any suspense, Han Sen beat Zheng Yuze and became the new Southwest
      Soldier King. Zheng Yuze was not able to fight back effectively from the
      beginning to the end. It was as if the two persons were not on the same
      level at all.
    </p>

    <p>
      In fact, Zheng Yuze was afraid before he even started, terrified by Tie
      Yi&#8217;s injuries inflicted by Han Sen. Zheng Yuze was too conservative
      to perform at his usual level. If he could fight normally instead of being
      overly defensive, Han Sen would not be able to win so smoothly.
    </p>

    <p>
      Although the title of Southwest Soldier King was an annual one, it was
      still quite valuable, especially for the fact that Han Sen beat Tiger of
      Blueblood Tie Yi to gain it.
    </p>

    <p>
      The chief himself personally awarded Han Sen the medal and certificate.
      Unfortunately, there was no material or monetary reward in the military,
      which upset Han Sen a little bit.
    </p>

    <p>
      The soldiers who had participated in the contest returned to their troops
      and told others about how Han Sen beat Tie Yi, making the name Han Sen
      known to almost everyone in the Southwest Galaxy, which was a great honor.
