<p>Two days later, Gu Qingcheng and Elysian Moon were happy to report to Han Sen that they had not grown any older. Although their connection was still there, they no longer had to combine if they wanted to survive.</p>

<p>Han Sen let out a long sigh. This was the best result he could have hoped for. If the problem hadn’t been resolved when he completed their genes, he had no other ideas on how to fix the issue. In the meantime, he spent all his energy practicing Big Destroyed. As he attempted to practice Big Destroyed safely, he wasn’t putting in enough power to fully cast Big Destroyed. But as time passed, and he practiced more and more, he was able to generate Big Destroyed’s light. But the Big Destroyed light he created wasn’t even enough to kill a Duke in its current state. That meant it couldn’t be used to consume King class xenogeneic genes.</p>

<p>Progress was progress, though, and his advancement thus far made Han Sen happy. If he could successfully activate Big Destroyed’s godlight, that meant developing power and control with the technique was only a matter of time.</p>

<p>Han Sen kept practicing Big Destroyed. As he got used to how Big Destroyed’s godlight worked, he grew more and more powerful with it.</p>

<p>Han Sen used King class xenogeneic genes to practice. A month later, his Big Destroyed godlight could digest King class xenogeneic genes. It turned them into a pile of dust that was smaller than a speck of powder.</p>

<p>He used Consume to eat the King class xenogeneic genes that he had ground up with Big Destroyed. When he tested the process, Han Sen noticed his digestive speed had increased. Within a day, he was able to absorb a dozen King class xenogeneic genes that had been ground up into a powder, earning a dozen King genes. “Hahaha! Big Destroyed is different. Right now, I still haven’t mastered the technique, but if I can practice and take Big Destroyed to the max, I think I’ll be able to absorb King class xenogeneic genes incredibly quickly. I might even be able to eat one hundred King class genes in a single day.” Han Sen was delighted. Within a few days, his Dongxuan Sutra’s area had broken through to another tier.</p>

<p>Elysian Moon and Gu Qingcheng wanted to go to the core area to hunt xenogeneics. When they told Han Sen where they were, he discovered that they were close to his Jadeskin spawn point. He had them wait there for him, and he entered the core area himself. He found Gu Qingcheng and Elysian Moon, and after the rendezvous, they went out to hunt core xenogeneics.</p>

<p>Most people never really worried about the future; they only worried about the present. Han Sen had lots of King class xenogeneic genes, but his Big Destroyed and Consume were getting stronger and stronger. If he was able to break down a hundred genes a day, eating a thousand King class xenogeneic genes would only take a week and a half.</p>

<p>Gu Qingcheng and Elysian Moon were first-tier Kings, but their powers exceeded what the average first-tier King could do. They were practically the same as Han Sen had been at his first-tier. Their skills and area powers were very good, so killing King class xenogeneics was a trivial affair.</p>

<p>But their digestion speed was much slower than Han Sen’s Consume. Even if Han Sen used Big Destroyed to break their xenogeneic genes down for them, they could only digest one per day. Han Sen wasn’t in a rush, but Li Keer was. She had been there for a whole month, waiting on Dollar’s return. Not even the flicker of his shadow showed up, though. It was like he never planned on coming back. Li Keer’s teeth itched.</p>

<p>“That *sshole.” Li Keer sat in the front of her ship, gritting her teeth and looking up into the sky. If he showed up, she’d probably have to fight off the urge to smack him.</p>

<p>“Little Sister, this is bad. The Very High should be emotionless, but you are very emotional right now. This is bad for you.” A very pretty woman appeared on her ship. She stood behind Li Keer and looked at her.</p>

<p>“Third Sister, why are you here?” Li Keer turned around to find a green-clothed woman standing behind her. The woman was pretty, but she was emotionless. Her face was like ice.</p>

<p>“I hear you have selected your target. Let me see how your silkworm is,” the woman said coldly.</p>

<p>“Good or bad, it doesn’t concern you.” Li Keer lifted her lips.</p>

<p>The woman, seeing Li Keer’s face, shook her head. “You’re displaying too many emotions. Your practice of the Very High talents isn’t up to par. I’m worried about you failing, or resorting to selecting a poor silkworm that can’t do anything in service of the Very High.”</p>

<p>“Good or bad, it is none of your business,” Li Keer insisted.</p>

<p>Third Sister didn’t become angry. She acted as if she hadn’t heard Li Keer at all, and emotionlessly said, “It doesn’t matter whether you admit it or not; I am your Third Sister. I cannot let you walk along this path of constant failure.”</p>

<p>Before she could reply, Third Sister continued, “Okay. Now tell me, where is this person you’ve chosen? Let me see if he is capable of serving the Very High.”</p>

<p>“He isn’t here right now,” Li Keer said.</p>

<p>“Why not call him over?” Third Sister said.</p>

<p>“I haven’t told him I am claiming him. I can’t contact him. If you are so smart, why don’t you go and find him for me?” Li Keer snarled.</p>

<p>“You are so slow. You still haven’t claimed him? What have you been doing all this time?” Third Sister frowned. She wasn’t happy with Li Keer’s progress.</p>

<p>Li Keer blushed. She had spent so much effort trying to convince Han Sen, but it never worked out. She hadn’t told him who she was, and thus, she couldn’t claim him.</p>

<p>Third Sister looked at Li Keer’s face but did not say anything. Something in her eyes swirled, looking as if a spinning galaxy was residing with them.“Tell me who your target is.” Third Sister’s eyes looked very magical.</p>

<p>“If you are so smart, why don’t you guess who it is?” Li Keer said in a sulky manner.</p>

<p>Again, Third Sister didn’t become angry. She just reached her hand out and grabbed one of Li Keer’s hairs. Then, she stared into that strand of hair with her shiny eyes.</p>

<p>Her spinning galaxy-like eyes revealed the image of Li Keer. The image danced as if the woman was rewinding time, revealing what Li Keer had been doing. Everything she had done in the past few days played before the woman’s eyes. Time quickly went back to when she parted ways with Han Sen.</p>

<p>“He is your target, yes? Dollar. I have heard his name. Right. He came first in the Geno Being Scroll. He defeated Lone Bamboo,” Third Sister said, her voice neutral. Then, she stopped looking. Her eyes returned to normal, and the strand of hair turned to dust in her hand.</p>

<p>“Third Sister, how could you read my past without my permission?” Li Keer sounded annoyed.</p>

<p>“Behavior like this doesn’t belong in the Very High.” Third Sister shook her head, ignoring Li Keer’s protest. The stars in her eyes were still spinning when she spoke to herself, saying, “Let me help you take a look at what this Dollar is doing. I will see if he can be your silkworm.”</p>

<p>Her eyes spun and the lights in them flashed. A shadow that looked like Han Sen appeared.</p>
