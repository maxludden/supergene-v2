<h2>Red Mist Mink</h2>
<h3>Chapter 1891</h3>

<p>The little beast got hit, and it squealed in agony. It turned
around and jumped towards Han Sen. Han Sen was very fast, and
because his rabbit shoes were Duke class, he had Duke class speed
to run with.</p>
<p>The beast was only Earl class, so it was much slower than Han
Sen.</p>
<p>Han Sen moved like a shadow. He swung his Ghost Teeth Knife and
hit the little beast again. Every time he did this, a small wound
was left on the creature. Over time, after many more strikes, those
cuts were all over its body.</p>
<p>The wounds kept bleeding as a purple mist oozed out of the
injuries. It was only a matter of time before the wounds started to
spread.</p>
<p>The beast was injured, and being unable to withstand the pain,
it sought to race back into Red Mist Valley to escape.</p>
<p>Han Sen felt depressed. He had the speed, and he had a good
knife to boot. Unfortunately, his powers were actually quite weak.
The Viscount class godlight, with Teeth Knife, could not grievously
injure the Earl class beast.</p>
<p>He continued to slash at the beast as well as he could, but the
foe was still able to escape into the valley.</p>
<p>“Little Uncle, draw him out again!” Han Sen retreated to a
position where he could hide.</p>
<p>Little Uncle ran back to the entrance, but this time without the
bike. The bike was too weak right now, so it was pointless bringing
it before an Earl.</p>
<p>“Where are you running off to, boy? Come out and fight Grandpa
Wang again!” Wang Yuhang kept barking into the mist, but the
creature did not reveal itself again. Perhaps it was because the
beast really was quite injured.</p>
<p>Wang Yuhang shouted like that for a while, until his voice
started to crack and leave him. Still, their foe refused to reveal
itself again.</p>
<p>“Hey, is it working? If it doesn’t work, we’ll just have to find
another way,” Xie Qing King shouted at Wang Yuhang.</p>
<p>Wang Yuhang acted confidently, and he said, “What do you mean?
Is it working? No! But I am a man, and I will not give up so
easily!”</p>
<p>After that, Wang Yuhang turned his back to the entrance of the
mist-veiled valley and pulled down his pants. He bent over to
reveal his butt, and in a bid to provoke the enemies inside the
mist, spread his cheeks. “If you have the balls, you’d come out and
fight with me! Otherwise, your kid is my kid.”</p>
<p>Squeak!</p>
<p>After Wang Yuhang shouted, a red shadow appeared. It was the
same beast, and it was still bleeding from the lacerations it had
procured earlier. It ran out, very angry, as if Wang Yuhang had
just slaughtered its parents.</p>
<p>Wang Yuhang started running, and eventually resummoned his
armor. Unfortunately, he was a little late in doing that, and he
suffered a bite. He lost a big chunk of flesh from his backside,
which bled profusely.</p>
<p>“Oh my God!” Wang Yuhang kept running as fast as he could.
Fortunately, he was able to reequip the armor and avoid getting
bitten again. But the blood from his bum dyed the armor red.</p>
<p>The beast was still not keen on giving up, though, and it kept
running after Wang Yuhang.</p>
<p>Han Sen gripped his knife and ran out after it. With his speed,
he caught up rapidly. The Ghost Teeth Knife, with Tusk, had created
a nasty wound on the monster. The beast’s recovery had been slow,
as a result. The wounds it had incurred were still bleeding, and
they were continuing to spread.</p>
<p>The beast wanted to kill Little Uncle, but Han Sen hit it again.
Now that it had regained its senses, it tried to reverse course
back to the valley.</p>
<p>Han Sen kept slashing it. He cast Jadeskin and the Blood-Pulse
Sutra, and he ran them both at maximum velocity. His body looked
like jade, and his blood was boiling.</p>
<p>Dong! Dong! Dong!</p>
<p>After three swings, Han Sen felt as if his own blood was going
to spill out. A weird, blood-like power entered his Ghost Teeth
Knife and dyed it red.</p>
<p>“Mutant Blood Ascended to Viscount.”</p>
<p>The announcement rang inside Han Sen’s mind, and it brought him
sheer delight. The Blood-Pulse Sutra had finally leveled up.</p>
<p>Katcha!</p>
<p>The now reddened Ghost Teeth Knife was covered in a Jadeskin
godlight. It came down on the beast and sliced its paws off.</p>
<p>Han Sen felt very happy about this. The red blade he now wielded
was flashing, and blood was being thrown about everywhere. Before
the enemy could escape all the way into the mist, Han Sen was able
to cut off its head.</p>
<p>“Red Mist Mink Xenogeneic Earl hunted; xenogeneic gene found.
Xenogeneic beast soul obtained.”</p>
<p>Han Sen was happy. He picked up the beast and cut it open. He
found a red bone inside its body, which he knew was the prized
xenogeneic gene.</p>
<p>“Help! I’m going to die.” Wang Yuhang was on the ground,
screaming. His butt had been sorely injured.</p>
<p>“No one told you to be that reckless.” Xie Qing King kicked Wang
Yuhang’s bleeding butt, which prompted another scream.</p>
<p>“You guys have no heart. I did this for you lot!”</p>
<p>Xie Qing King looked at the man with disdain and said, “You had
it coming.”</p>
<p>“Little Silver, go heal him,” Han Sen called to Little
Silver.</p>
<p>“No… argh!” Before Wang Yuhang could finish, Little Silver fired
two bolts of lightning at him—one from each eye. They struck Wang
Yuhang’s bum and had him squealing in even more pain.</p>
<p>Little Silver’s Viscount class healing was very effective. Its
only downside was that it dished out a lot of pain. Wang Yuhang’s
wounds were completely healed after a short amount of time.</p>
<p>“Little Uncle, try again. See if there are any more xenogeneics
inside.” Han Sen smiled at Wang Yuhang.</p>
<p>Wang Yuhang didn’t want to, but he still shouted before the
entrance of the valley. He wasn’t taking his pants off this time,
though.</p>
<p>After a while, there appeared to be nothing more. Xie Qing King
decided to sketch some shadows and send them into the valley,
though. They soon disappeared, but not because they were
attacked.</p>
<p>“It looks like there are no more xenogeneics inside.” Xie Qing
King put his book away and approached the valley.</p>
<p>They all entered that place, and as suspected, they weren’t
attacked. The red mist was too strong, though, and they couldn’t
make out anything.</p>
<p>“The mist is too strong! I can’t see anything. I won’t be able
to see any sort of treasure, assuming there is something here,”
Wang Yuhang said.</p>
<p>They couldn’t find anything there, so eventually, they abandoned
the valley.</p>
<p>“There has to be something. It’s just that finding it will be
annoying.” Xie Qing King frowned.</p>
<p>Han Sen was going to say something, but suddenly, an aircraft
came flying down towards Mirror Lake.</p>
<p>“It doesn’t look like an aircraft that belongs to the Rebate.
Who would seek to visit this place now, of all times?” Han Sen
frowned and called for everyone to return.</p>
<p>There weren’t many electronic tools that could be used on Planet
Eclipse. If they wanted to get some intel, they’d have to go back
to base.</p>
<p>Outside of Mirror Base, an aircraft came to park. When the door
of the ship opened, it revealed a woman with white, monk-like
robes. The woman was very beautiful, and she had a red dot on her
forehead. She was a Buddha.</p>
