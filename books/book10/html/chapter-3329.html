<p>Han Sen pointed at the gourd symbol and asked, “What is the
meaning of this gourd symbol on the tablet?”</p>
<p>White King said, “That was left behind by the fairy that made
the White Jade Jing. It is a sign of the fairy.”</p>
<p>Han Sen did not know if White King was hiding something or not.
There was a chance he didn’t know what the marking of the gourd
actually meant. He had a brief think and asked, “I am very curious.
This fairy power is something even a god spirit is not as good
with. I wonder what he looked like, and which race he used to
be.”</p>
<p>White King and Bottle Fairy seemed to understand what Han Sen
was thinking, but it was just because Han Sen was curious about the
identity of the fairy. He did not mean it in any other way.</p>
<p>Bottle Fairy looked cocky and said, “I do not know which race
the fairy belonged to, but I believe it was a grand existence
beyond all other creatures. It is just as you said. Even a sky full
of God Spirits cannot compare to it. The way I am is the result of
the fairy creature herself. The fairy superiors must be much
greater than me too.”</p>
<p>“That means the fairy and my appearance are similar,” Han Sen
said. “Was it a boy or a girl?”</p>
<p>“Of course, it would be the same as me,” Bottle Fairy replied.
“It was a woman.”</p>
<p>“Was it a female fairy? Did she ever say what her name was?” Han
Sen was even more curious.</p>
<p>“A fairy is a fairy. They do not need names.” Bottle Fairy
peered at Han Sen and asked, “Why are you asking so many things
that are unrelated to all this? The fairy’s laws are the foundation
of White Jade Jing. It is controlled by us. No one can violate the
laws of the fairies or the White Jade Jing would kill us. Do you
feel safer now?”</p>
<p>“In that case, I can give these jade fairy lives a body,” Han
Sen said. “You should both know that this is not something that can
be accomplished in a few days. I have stuff to sort out on my own.
So, I can only come to White Jade Jing once in a while. I cannot
stay for long.”</p>
<p>White King nodded. “It is fine. Just remember the promise you
made. It is just this time, there is a jade fairy I would like you
to provide with a body first.”</p>
<p>Han Sen wanted to know what was so special about the next jade
fairy, but he didn’t ask. He would see that jade fairy very soon,
so there was no need to be too hasty about it all.</p>
<p>White King and Bottle Fairy led Han Sen away from the jade
tablet. Han Sen thought he would take him to the White Jade City or
one of the other three cities, but White King took him to one of
the 12 buildings.</p>
<p>Han Sen wondered, “Weird. With the relationship between White
King and Bottle Fairy, the jade fairies in the 12 buildings should
be lower than those in the five cities. How could this important
jade fairy be inside one of the white jade buildings and not in one
of the five cities?” Still, he did not ask anything. He just
continued following White King and Bottle Fairy. He walked past a
jade building and a jade city.</p>
<p>One thing that confused Han Sen was that the 12 buildings and
five cities had 17 jade fairies, but there was only White King and
Bottle Fairy. How could the jade fairy not have shown up?</p>
<p>He walked all the way to the first jade building. White King and
Bottle Fairy came to a stop. The pair looked at the first white
jade building with conflicted looks.</p>
<p>Han Sen was no stranger to the first white jade building. When
he used to practice in Sky Palace, he gained access to the white
jade building. He frequently went to the first building to absorb
the jade air.</p>
<p>The first white jade building was looking far greater than it
used to. That being said, the jade building had not changed all
that much. It was a white jade building with seven floors.</p>
<p>The white jade building was the first jade building out of the
12 buildings. They only supported a bit of jade air. Compared to
the other 11 buildings, this one looked rather lame.</p>
<p>Looking at the faces of White King and Bottle Fairy, one could
discern that this first building must have been unique.</p>
<p>White King looked at the jade building’s door. The white jade
building’s door opened. Han Sen followed White King and entered. He
felt the jade building’s jade air was similar to water. It was pure
and warm. It was far stronger than how it used to be.</p>
<p>If Han Sen was there, just the pure jade air was enough to
rocket him up to king class straight away.</p>
<p>“What a good place. If I practice Jadeskin here, I will reach
the max level.” Han Sen felt a bit disappointed. “It is such a
shame this place has now been taken by the jade fairies and cannot
be reclaimed.</p>
<p>The tower had changed a lot. The space inside was bigger. There
was a jade spirit dancing like a jellyfish in the jade air.</p>
<p>Han Sen had a closer look. The jade spirit was gathered up by
jade air. Its formation was pure. If it could have been swallowed,
it would have been extremely beneficial for his Jadeskin.</p>
<p>If he could obtain help from the jade spirit, Han Sen’s Break
World Jadeskin would have increased. That, in turn, would have
boosted his Break World rate.</p>
<p>The higher Han Sen went, the purer the jade air became. The
three of them went to the top of the building. There, White King
and Bottle Fairy came to a stop. They looked at the ceiling of the
jade building.</p>
<p>Han Sen looked up there too. There was a statue carved from a
hunk of jade on the ceiling. The creature looked very weird.</p>
<p>It was a white sheep. It was pure white. Its horns were crooked
like corkscrews. It looked calm. Countless amounts of jade air came
out of the sheep jade statue. It came out similar to a pure spring
of water.</p>
<p>“Please, give this one a body first.” White King pointed at the
ceiling and the jade sheep statue perched there.</p>
<p>“That cannot be the first floor of the jade fairy leader.” Han
Sen did not do anything yet. He consulted with White King
first.</p>
<p>White King did not deny it. “Yes.”</p>
<p>“The White Jade Jing has revived, so why did this not revive?”
Han Sen asked.</p>
<p>“That does not matter,” White King said to Han Sen while looking
at him. “The most important thing for me to ask of you is if
whether or not you can give it a body.”</p>
<p>“I will do my best to, but this jade fairy is too strong,” Han
Sen said. “I must confess, I do not know if I really am able to do
this. Even if I can, my power will be depleted. I am afraid I will
not be able to give more bodies to the jade fairies for a
while.”</p>
<p>“It is fine. Just try your best to do this one.” White King did
not change his emotion. He sounded cool and calm.</p>
<p>White King did not mention any reasons, so there was nothing
else he could do. Han Sen had to clamp down on his curiosity and
put his focus into the Blood-Pulse Sutra. He used a Break World
power to enter the ceiling and jade sheep statue.</p>
<p>The sheep was the leader of the first jade building’s jade
fairy. It should not have been weaker than a Break World creature
like Bottle Fairy. Blood-Pulse Sutra could change its body, but Han
Sen was not 100% certain.</p>
<p>Bottle Fairy and White King were special people. Their Break
World rates must have been high. Even Han Sen could not see what
they were really trying to do.</p>
<p>The reason Han Sen agreed to help White Jade Jing’s jade fairy
get a body was that he wanted to use the power of the White Jade
Jing.</p>
<p>Qin Xiu and God Chaos Party were frightening. Han Sen could not
deal with them alone. If he could muster the power of the White
Jade Jing, it would be better for fighting the God Chaos Party.</p>
<p>Countless amounts of Break World power went into the jade sheep
statue. After half an hour, the jade sheep statue had yet to react.
Nothing happened as it did with the little black jade beast.</p>
<p>“It looks like the Break World rate of my Blood-Pulse Sutra is
too low. It does not work well on these powerful Break World
creatures.” Han Sen was depressed.</p>
