<p>“Hardman, your business is great You have spent such a small
amount of money on someone who has the possibility of becoming a
Noble.” Hei Xun sat down next to a monitor and started a discussion
with Hardman.</p>
<p>Hardman laughed and said, “It is difficult to tell if he will be
able to generate a geno weapon. Even with the flowers chinning, the
possibility still stands on a fifty-fifty.”</p>
<p>Everyone could hear the false humility in Hardman’s voice. Fifty
percent was actually quite high, especially considering how few
people could make the flowers ring.</p>
<p>Lan Se observed Han Sen through the monitor and looked
curious.</p>
<p>She knew he had made the flowers chime, but she hadn’t learned
much more since then. She had looked for Han Sen in the graveyard,
but Hardman had already come to him first and whisked him away.</p>
<p>Lan Se was curious to see if Han Sen could become a Noble. If he
was truly able to, he’d have a near-infinite amount of wealth and
fame.</p>
<p>Han Sen started casting his skills. Nobody said anything now,
and everyone focused closely on him.</p>
<p>Han Sen used The Story of Genes and felt that his flesh, skin,
bones, chest, and even genes were releasing some mystic
substance.</p>
<p>The substance was like a sprout coming out of the soil. His skin
was that soil, and the black substance began to grow across it It
enveloped Han Sen, shredding all the clothes he had been
wearing.</p>
<p>The black substance kept on expanding, forming into a set of
armor all around him. The more of that black substance arose, the
more the armor took shape.</p>
<p>Hardman looked at Han Sen and his geno armor, watching it as it
changed. His palms were sweating in anticipation. He had spent
quite a lot on Han Sen, and if this evolution failed, Hardman would
be losing quite a bit on the gambit he had taken.</p>
<p>But if he succeeded, he’d be far richer. The mere prospect of
having a Noble join Black Gold Group made him supremely excited. He
could very well become a chairman.</p>
<p>Everyone looked at Han Sen’s armor in keen interest Lan Se was
curious, whereas Hei Xun remained emotionless. It was almost as if
all this did not matter to him one small bit</p>
<p>Ten minutes later, the shape around Han Sen was completed. The
black armor he was wearing was very detailed, and there wasn’t a
single seam around Han Sen’s entire body.</p>
<p>Just as everyone thought the process was finished, the armor
began to twist. A black pattern emerged across its surface.</p>
<p>If you looked closer, however, you’d realize it wasn’t a
pattern. They were symbols and words none of them could understand.
They sank into the armor’s surface like engravings</p>
<p>When they were revealed, Han Sen’s armor looked very
mysterious.</p>
<p>“No wonder he made the flowers chime. I have never before seen a
set of armor look anything remotely like this,” Hardman said.</p>
<p>Generating a geno armor was always a weird spectacle, but he had
thought Han Sen could also generate a geno weapon. Hei Xun still
did not say a word. He kept on looking at Han Sen and his geno
armor.</p>
<p>The patterns that had appeared on Han Sen’s armor looked mystic
and beautiful. They made Han Sen’s armor a rather mesmerizing
sight</p>
<p>Although there were no powerful energy readings, the geno armor
had a strange energy of its own. Of course, the armor was brand
new, so the energy wasn’t very strong.</p>
<p>Ten minutes later, the geno armor stopped developing. The
process looked to have been completed.</p>
<p>To Han Sen, it didn’t really feel like armor. It actually felt
like a part of his own body, generating this massive power
flow.</p>
<p>Han Sen’s brain felt as if it was rattling, and then, all of a
sudden, a voice started to ring in his head.</p>
<p>“Evolution Process Complete.”</p>
<p>Han Sen was shocked hearing this. It was the same voice he had
heard all the time in the sanctuaries, and he thought it was
something that only played within the sanctuaries. He was shocked
it still existed, even out here.</p>
