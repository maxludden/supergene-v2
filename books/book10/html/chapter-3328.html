	<p>The black jade little beast’s body slowly moved. It looked stiff. It was like a rusted robot.</p>

	<p>Every time it moved, some cracks formed on the jade-stone shell. The cracks were getting bigger and bigger. Huge
		chunks of it fell off. There was wet, black hair underneath the black jade shell.</p>

	<p>White King and the blue-clothed fairy’s eyes were riddled with nothing short of utter confusion. If Han Sen had
		just enabled the black jade little beast to wake up, it would have completely shocked them.</p>

	<p>The reason they were confused, however, was because the black jade little beast was not solely awoken anymore.
	</p>

	<p>If it was awake, the jade statue would have had a spirit. This jade statue was just a jade statue. Its bodies
		were not truly living. There was no lifecycle inside it like a real creature.</p>

	<p>To put things more directly, the jade fairies in the Black King City were just puppets of Black King. When Black
		King was there, they could be given some sort of will. With Black King gone, they were just a collection of jade
		stone statues.</p>

	<p>Now, the black jade little beast had shed its jade-stone shell. It had real blood and flesh, but it was not as
		simple as being awake.</p>

	<p>“Roar!” A roaring sound shook the whole of the black jade city. The black jade little beast stood up and roared
		to the sky. The rest of the black jade flew everywhere, revealing the entirety of its body.</p>

	<p>“It is alive?” The blue-clothed fairy looked shocked. Even millions of years ago, she had never seen something
		quite this shocking.</p>

	<p>Back then, when the fairy went to the White Jade Jing and turned the White Jade Jing into a place composed of 12
		buildings and five cities, everything there came from that fairy.</p>

	<p>The pavilion, buildings, old towers, jade cities, one grass, one wood, one beast, one bird, one bug, and one fish
		were all made by the fairy jade statue.</p>

	<p>Because the White Jade Jing carvings almost used all of the fairy’s power, in the end, the fairy was only able to
		create the most sacred 12 buildings, five cities, and 17 jade statues with a life and soul.</p>

	<p>Although those other jade statues came from the hands of that fairy, they could only rely on Black King and the
		17 jade statues’ power. They were not real-life forces.</p>

	<p>Now, the little black beast had developed a real life pulse. Its power was like the fairy that had created the
		White Jade Jing in the first place. How could the blue-clothed fairy and White King not end up shocked?</p>

	<p>The little black beast had a real body. It shook its body and looked around. It looked at Han Sen and jumped
		toward him.</p>

	<p>Han Sen was trapped by the trap fairy net. He was unable to avoid the little black beast, so it came right on
		him.</p>

	<p>The little black beast did not seek to hurt Han Sen. It put its tongue out and licked Han Sen’s face. It looked
		very intimate. It was as if Han Sen was a member of its family.</p>

	<p>“Stop licking!” Han Sen’s hands could not move. His inability to move enabled the little black beast to keep
		licking him. There was nothing he could do to stop it.</p>

	<p>It took a while for the little black beast to calm down and stop licking. Han Sen asked, “How was that? Do you
		guys believe me now?”</p>

	<p>“Bottle Fairy, let him go,” White King said.</p>

	<p>The blue-clothed fairy looked shocked for a long time. When she heard White King, she made sure to react. She
		calmed herself down and put away the fairy net.</p>

	<p>Han Sen stood up and stretched. The little black beast saw Han Sen stand up and thought he was going to play with
		it. So, it jumped at Han Sen.</p>

	<p>Han Sen touched its head. That little guy’s hands and legs were short. Its nails were very sharp. They were like
		wheels. They were unable to touch Han Sen’s body.</p>

	<p>“Little Guy, you go and play over there,” Han Sen said to the little black beast. It seemed to understand Han Sen
		and crawled to the side. It kept crawling away while looking back at Han Sen. It looked as if it did not want to
		leave.</p>

	<p>“What is your name?” White King did not have any emotions, but his words were obviously infused with a penchant
		for more niceties.</p>

	<p>“My name is Han Sen,” Han Sen answered.</p>

	<p>White King nodded, looked at Han Sen, and said, “If you are able to give a body to the jade fairies in the White
		Jade Jing, the crime of you killing Black King can be erased. Furthermore, you will be considered a friend of
		the White Jade Jing.”</p>

	<p>“I wonder what the benefits of being White Jade Jing’s friend are.” Han Sen could tell White King and the
		blue-clothed fairy White King had referred to as Bottle Fairy was shocked about the little black beast being
		revived.</p>

	<p>White King had also only mentioned the jade fairies of White Jade Jing and not Black King City. This was
		interesting.</p>

	<p>White King said, “If you need help, for as long as you do not go against the laws of the White Jade Jing’s fairy
		laws, I will give my life to fight for you.”</p>

	<p>“That does not seem like a bad deal, but how do I know you will keep your promise?” Han Sen asked. “To revive the
		jade statue is something that requires a lot of power. Getting all of the lives here to be made flesh will not
		be an easy task. I am afraid I will need eight or 10 years to do that.”</p>

	<p>“Let us not talk about eight or 10 years. Even if it takes a hundred years or a thousand years, I will be able to
		wait for that. If you are willing to do this, we can wait a thousand years.” White King paused a moment and
		said, “Regarding your worries, it is pointless. We follow the rules of the fairies. We are under the rule of the
		fairies. If we make a vow, we are compelled to complete it. Otherwise, the White Jade Jing’s holy laws would
		punish us. Even I would be subject to it.”</p>

	<p>Han Sen thought White King was being very serious. It did not seem as if he was speaking randomly, so he asked,
		“What are the fairy laws?”</p>

	<p>“Please come here,” White King said. Then, he walked to Black King City.</p>

	<p>Han Sen did not hesitate. He followed after him while Bottle Fairy came along from behind. She looked at Han Sen
		with a complicated expression.</p>

	<p>There were 12 buildings and five cities. It was something Han Sen had already seen. Now, the 12 buildings and
		five cities were bigger. There was not much of a difference aside from that.</p>

	<p>White King did not bring Han Sen to peruse the 12 towers and five cities. After going by the five cities, they
		went to the highest peak of the White Jade Jing. There was a white jade tablet there.</p>

	<p>The white jade tablet had many laws. Han Sen had a look at them. Many of the laws were weird, but they were all
		quite serious. One of the fairy laws stated that if a fairy made a promise, they could not break it, or the
		White Jade Jing would take away their fairy bodies.</p>

	<p>There were too many laws. Han Sen could not be bothered reading much more. He looked around. On the left bottom
		corner of the white jade tablet, he saw a symbol.</p>

	<p>The white jade tablet had many words. There was only one illustration, and it was the symbol in that corner. It
		was the symbol of a gourd.</p>

	<p>Han Sen thought that gourd was very familiar. It was like the gourd he had before Bao’er was born. The size and
		shape were similar.</p>
