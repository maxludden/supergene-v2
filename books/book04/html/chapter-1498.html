    <p>
      A big battleship had leaped out of slipspace, appearing directly above Han
      Sen’s airship.
    </p>
    <p>
      “A shura battleship?” Han Sen and Ji Yanran’s faces changed when they saw
      it. The ship looked strange, and it wasn’t similar to any human ship they
      had seen before. It didn’t quite look like a shura ship, either.
    </p>
    <p>
      “This area belongs to the Alliance. There is no way a shura ship would
      appear here.” Ji Yanran was handling the ship, and she moved it away from
      a possible attack trajectory.
    </p>
    <p>
      This possibly-shura battleship was enormous. Comparing it to Han Sen’s
      ship was like comparing an elephant with an ant. Before Ji Yanran could
      drive off, the battleship opened up what looked like a tunnel, and then
      they were pulled inside.
    </p>
    <p>
      After Han Sen’s ship was abducted, the battleship went into slipspace once
      again and disappeared.
    </p>
    <p>
      In Han Sen’s ship, on-screen, there was a signal telling him that they had
      been boarded. Then, the image of a royal shura appeared.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Demi-God Han Sen, if I were you, I’d bring your family down to talk.” The
      royal shura was smiling.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Do you think your battleship can trap me here?” Han Sen said, looking at
      the royal shura.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Of course not. A star-class battleship cannot trap a demigod. But look
      outside; there are five demigod elites standing right outside the ship,
      and they can destroy you immediately. Even if you are fearless against
      such odds, you must consider the well-being of your family.” The royal
      shura was sounding as if he had everything sorted out, under control.
    </p>
    <p>
      Han Sen looked outside the ship and he saw five humans there, alongside a
      few royal shuras. They did indeed look powerful, just like demigods.
    </p>
    <p>
      What shocked Han Sen and Ji Yanran the most was that the humans and shura
      were standing there together. Even stranger, there was no sign that this
      was a proper shura army. This didn’t look like a formally sanctioned team.
    </p>
    <p>
      Han Sen’s power was enough to break a star-class battleship, but with so
      many demigods there, he wouldn’t be able to save his own airship.
    </p>
    <p>
      Han Sen could survive in space for a time, but Ji Yanran and Littleflower
      could not.
    </p>
    <p>“Who are you people?” Han Sen asked with a frown.</p>
    <p>
      The shura smiled before answering. “Han Sen, do not worry. We are not
      working for the shura. We are not working for anyone, as a matter of fact.
      We are an organization that trumpets liberty, and we have requested your
      presence here to strike a deal.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “What deal?” Han Sen was not nervous in any way. As a matter of fact, he
      was quite interested.
    </p>
    <p>
      Even if their ship was destroyed, Han Sen still had his black beetle to
      use. He wasn’t in that much danger.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Why don’t we sit down and talk, so I can explain things to you?” The
      royal shura smiled once more.
    </p>
    <p>
      Han Sen and Ji Yanran looked at each other and then nodded. Han Sen
      responded with an, “Okay.”
    </p>
    <p>
      Han Sen opened the ship. He and Ji Yanran, holding Littleflower and
      Bao’er, stepped out. The five demigod humans and shuras approached.
    </p>
    <p>
      “I’ve come to know a lot about you. My name is Naga, and I am the
      vice-leader of the New Community. The four by my side are also important
      members.” It was the royal shura on-screen earlier that was now before
      him. He smiled when he spoke to Han Sen.
    </p>
    <p>
      Han Sen and Ji Yanran frowned. They had never heard of the New Community
      before, but apparently, it already had five demigods as members. It also
      seemed to include a mix of humans and shuras. They should have heard of a
      powerful organization such as this before.
    </p>
    <p>
      “For what reason did you kidnap me and my family?” Han Sen asked,
      straightly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Naga told him, “It’s not how we usually treat guests, but I’d ask you to
      come to the discussion room.”
    </p>
    <p>
      Han Sen and Ji Yanran did not reject their offer. They were here now, and
      where exactly they discussed matters did not make much of a difference.
    </p>
    <p>
      They followed Naga to the discussion room, where only Naga remained with
      them. The other four demigods did not join, but a lady brought some drinks
      and was in the room briefly before leaving.
    </p>
    <p>
      “We were supposed to see you at your home, but because of the limited
      power we possess, we had to do this.” Naga seemed apologetic.
    </p>
    <p>
      “I’m surprised you went to such lengths. It must have been difficult for
      you.” Han Sen knew that even if they were not shura, appearing here and
      doing what they had was not an easy task to accomplish.
    </p>
    <p>
      Their little kidnapping hadn’t simply required a battleship and a few
      demigods. They must have had influence in the Alliance to be allowed to
      slipspace into where they had appeared.
    </p>
    <p>
      “The effort was worth it, since we’ve been able to meet you.” Naga spoke
      with sincerity.
    </p>
    <p>“Then what do you want me here for?” Han Sen asked.</p>
    <p>
      Naga looked at him seriously. “I want to invite you to the New Community,
      and have you become one of us.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “I don’t know anything about this New Community; why would I join?” Han
      Sen said.
    </p>
    <p>
      Naga expected him to say this. “The New Community is an organization in
      which race does not matter. All the members are composed of different
      races. There are humans, shura, and others, too. Our purpose is to keep
      the universe safe and make sure that every race is treated fairly.”
    </p>
    <p>
      Han Sen felt as if the New Community was more of a religion or a business
      organization. They had many demigods and different races, though, so it
      wasn’t a normal religion if it was one.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Han Sen, don’t you want to see peace flourish between races?” Naga looked
      at Han Sen.
    </p>
    <p>
      Han Sen coldly responded, “I want peace in the universe, but I’m just an
      average guy. I don’t have such far-reaching dreams. Keeping the world safe
      sounds like it should be your job.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Han Sen, you only need to support the ideology. How much extra you do for
      it does not matter. Even if you only do a small bit, it’s fine. We are an
      organization that believes in freedom. If you can help us in small matters
      when we need it, that would be tremendous,” Naga said.
    </p>
    <p>“What small help?” Han Sen asked.</p>
    <p>
      “it is hard for us to say, but every action performed will be for the
      betterment of others. You will know this.”
    </p>
    <p>
      Han Sen frowned. It seemed as if Naga wasn’t keen on going into detail,
      and any information Han Sen wished to extract was proving too difficult to
      retrieve.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Sorry. I am not that thoughtful of others; you’ve got the wrong man. You
      can go to the association that protects different races. The members there
      will probably share the same values as you do,” Han Sen said.
    </p>
    <p>
      Naga stopped smiling, and with a serious look, he said, “Han Sen, I hope
      you can reconsider your stance. Your power is capable of threatening most
      creatures that exist in the universe. If I can’t ensure that your work
      will be for the betterment of others, I will have to employ force to
      ensure you do not bring harm, instead.”
