Gru didn’t know what Han Sen was thinking, though. He looked down at the two xenogeneics and said, “A Moon Rhino and an Immortal Dragon. They are rare xenogeneics, but it is a shame they are only King class. If they were deified, they would be worth a lot of money. That would be especially true of the Immortal Dragon. If an Immortal Dragon can become deified, then its substance chains can make others practically immortal as well. For as long as the Immortal Dragon retains its power, anyone it has vowed to protect is essentially unkillable. It is a shame that deified Immortal Dragons are incredibly rare. In all the history I have learned, I have only heard of three deified Immortal Dragons.”

“Their powers aren’t sufficient at King class?” Han Sen asked with curiosity.

Gru shook his head. “King class Immortal Dragons have a decent area power, but the ability is only useful for healing some external trauma. For most elites, that isn’t very useful. Taming one of the creatures for that ability alone is hardly worth it. Deified Immortal Dragons are a different story, however. They can keep you alive in all sorts of situations. Many deified elites would like to have a deified Immortal Dragon. Anyone would want something that has the potential to save their lives.”

When he heard Gru say this, Han Sen’s heart jumped. He thought to himself, “It is very lucky that I’ve found this Immortal Dragon to use in my test. If the black crystal really works, maybe I can get a deified Immortal Dragon.”

“Brother Han, the deified xenogeneic I want to kill is in Full Moon River. It is only 200 miles from here. If you have the time, maybe we can go there?” Gru said hopefully to Han Sen.

“I want to get a xenogeneic as a mount. Based on what you’ve told me, the Immortal Dragon doesn’t seem too bad. I think I’ll capture that Immortal Dragon. Once I have the Immortal Dragon, if you still haven’t killed the deified xenogeneic on your own, I can go as well to help you out.” If Gru’s xenogeneic was really that nearby, Han Sen wouldn’t mind going after it.

“Sure. I will stay here and wait for you. It is just an Immortal Dragon, so I am sure you will get it easily.” Gru smiled.

Han Sen didn’t care if the man stayed. It would only be a matter of time before others found out he was catching a xenogeneic. There was no way to hide it, but neither was there a need to.

The two of them waited where they were for a while. The Immortal Dragon was beating the pulp out of the Moon Rhino; with its immortal area active, the Immortal Dragon was impervious to the rhino’s attacks.

In the end, Han Sen and Gru watched the Immortal Dragon open its mouth and choke down the badly injured Moon Rhino.

The rhino’s body was much bigger than the Immortal Dragon’s body. After the Immortal Dragon swallowed its foe, its body expanded like a big balloon. Han Sen wondered if the dragon could actually digest something so large.

But for Han Sen, this was a very good opportunity. The Immortal Dragon had eaten the entire Moon Rhino, and it was now settling down to digest its meal. It wasn’t paying much attention to its surroundings.

Han Sen flew toward it and fired out an array of silks from his knife. Han Sen lifted his finger, and the knife silks tied up the Immortal Dragon.

Immortal Dragon was terrified. It shivered in fear, but when it tried to run away, the knife silks tightened and cut into the creature’s body. Although its area was obscenely powerful, it wouldn’t help much if the dragon sliced itself into pieces.

Once it had recovered, the creature tried to struggle free again. It was worried about being cut, though. Eventually, the Immortal Dragon realized that it couldn’t escape the knife silks without killing itself. It stopped moving, carefully trying not to touch the knife silks circling its body.

“It seems to be fairly intelligent,” Han Sen said with a laugh. And then, he lifted a hand and drew slowly on the knife silks. The Immortal Dragon immediately responded to the tug, slithering forward across the ground to keep the silks from drawing tight again.

But the Moon Rhino was still in the creature’s belly. The roundness of its stomach made it difficult for the Immortal Dragon to slither forward. It moved way too slow, and the knife silks cut into the beast’s scales. Each cut caused the creature to release a nasty screech.

“You are good, Brother Han. The power to create these silks and control them with masterful precision… You aren’t too far off the talent of a genuine deified elite,” Gru complimented him.

“You’re laying it on thick.” Han Sen was still suspicious that Gru might be harboring ulterior motives.

Even if Gru wasn’t a part of the Bai family, there were many within the Extreme King that hated Han Sen. Han Sen doubted that Gru was as detached as he seemed.

But now that he had agreed to go with Gru, he no longer had an excuse to delay their venture. He left the Immortal Dragon trapped in the knife silks. Every hour the fiend spent in captivity would grind at its mind. Han Sen then turned to follow Gru deep up Full Moon River.

Han Sen still suspected that Gru might have a conspiracy up his sleeve, but when they reached their destination, Han Sen was relieved to find that there really was a deified xenogeneic on the riverbank.

That xenogeneic looked like a wolf. Its hair was grey, but it had four eyes. Its fangs were like hooks. The beast looked extremely evil.

As they made their way up the river, Gru had told Han Sen that the deified xenogeneic was talented with eye skills. Its eyes released an indestructible godlight. The creature’s attacks were shockingly fast. Gru wouldn’t have lasted long on his own.

The four-eyed wolf saw Gru, and it howled angrily and got to its feet. Its four eyes opened wide, and a weird green light began to glow inside them. The beast suddenly released four green beams that shot right toward Gru.

Clearly, the four-eyed wolf really hated Gru. It was obvious that this wasn’t the first time Gru had come to challenge the beast.

Gru already had experience dealing with the wolf. When he saw the creature’s four green lights coming, he pulled out a shield and used it to protect his body.

Gru’s shield looked oddly fragile. It resembled a silver mirror, and it seemed like a single punch would be enough to crack it.

But when those four scary substance chains struck the weird shield, the reflective surface of the glass bounced them away. Gru remained unharmed.

“What a strong shield!” Han Sen said in praise.

Gru was half-deified, and yet he was able to use his shield to deflect the substance chains of a deified xenogeneic without much difficulty. Clearly, the strange shield was something truly unique.

Gru laughed. “Mister Xun lent me this deified treasure. This shield can deflect eye skills and visual skills. I borrowed it so I could deal with this four-eyed wolf. It is embarrassing, but the mirror shield can only block the four-eyed wolf’s eyelights. It does not, however, lend me additional speed. And I still can’t block the creature’s physical attacks. I cannot hurt it, and yet, it almost kills me each time.”

After pausing, Gru looked at Han Sen and said, “Brother Han, you have the Apollo Set. With the speed gifted to you by the armor’s wings, you should be able to keep up with the wolf. When it uses its eyelights again, I will use the mirror shield to block. Then, you take that opportunity to swoop in and strike.”

“Sure.” Han Sen nodded. However, Han Sen was silently thinking, “I have just absorbed the ice geno core, which should have given me some new powers. Now I can give it a spin and see what it does.”
