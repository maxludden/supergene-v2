	<p>The sky full of deathly butterfly shadows was like an underworld river flooding toward Very High Leader. They
		peeled off his flesh. Even his god body could not withstand the butterfly shadow&#8217;s power. His entire body,
		up and down, had been ravaged to display the bones inside.</p>

	<p>Han Sen was not happy about this. Clearly, things could not be over that simple. God had planned for every twist
		and turn and would not lose the bet on this seemingly expected outcome.</p>

	<p>Blergh!</p>

	<p>God blood was dyeing the whole land red. Seeing Very High Leader was about to become a pile of bones, the
		butterfly lady suddenly spat out her own torrent of god blood. It looked like she had been heavily damaged. The
		sky full of butterfly shadows was now gone.</p>

	<p>Han Sen was not surprised. He quietly looked at the butterfly lady, wanting to see what had happened.</p>

	<p>The butterfly lady seemed to be suffering vast amounts of pain. She generated a butterfly shadow to cut Very High
		Leader&#8217;s body. Every time the butterfly shadow cut Very High Leader, the butterfly lady herself was
		bleeding as well. Her damage was just as much as the damage Very High Leader was taking.</p>

	<p>Very High Leader&#8217;s body had almost become a skeleton that had no flesh on it. His face still didn&#8217;t
		change. He looked at the butterfly lady and said, &#8220;You are a love butterfly. A butterfly will only fall in
		love once in their entire life. That contract has you bound to me already. That means we will live and die
		together. Hurting me means hurting yourself too. Why are you doing this?&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;As I said, if you are going to dump me, we can both go to hell!&#8221; The butterfly lady looked terrible
		as she spoke. Her expression was determined but weird. There was no other way for her to proceed.</p>

	<p>Many butterfly shadows flew over the Very High Leader. They sliced and diced what remained of Very High
		Leader&#8217;s body. The blood in the butterfly lady&#8217;s mouth was spilling out with less control as time
		went by. She was looking worse and worse. It looked as if her injuries were no better than Very High Leader.</p>

	<p>&#8220;A butterfly can only have one relationship in their entire life, huh? I do not know if I should be sad or
		instead admire the loyalty and determination of one who can commit for so long.&#8221; God was getting very
		emotional by watching the two, who were in love but killing each other. It sighed and said, &#8220;This is
		sadder than anything else.&#8221;</p>

	<p>Han Sen was thinking, Weren&#8217;t you the one to make this happen?</p>

	<p>God seemed to know what Han Sen was thinking and seriously said, &#8220;This was still entirely their decision. I
		only gave them the options of how to proceed. They could have selected a better ending, but it is a shame they
		had to choose the most upsetting route.&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;But because of that, life becomes more meaningful. Life without love and hatred is very boring.&#8221; God
		continued to sigh.</p>

	<p>&#8220;That is just what you think,&#8221; Han Sen said. &#8220;I am pretty sure most people just want their life
		to be comfortable and without excitement. They don&#8217;t want the drama and heartbreak of complex love.&#8221;
	</p>

	<p>God looked at Han Sen and asked. &#8220;Is that it? According to what you are saying, you only have to find a
		random and rare system. With your power, you can control everything and live your life safely. If that was true,
		why must you go everywhere you can to experience as much danger as possible?&#8221;</p>

	<p>Han Sen was suddenly speechless. He did not know how to answer that.</p>

	<p>&#8220;Life is pretty because of greed, and love, hatred, and relationships are the prettiest flowers of the tree
		of greed. Watching it now, the most beautiful sad flower is soon to open. That is very rare. You should just
		remain focused and admire it.&#8221; God focused its attention on Very High Leader and the butterfly lady, who
		were in the middle of loving each other and killing each other. God&#8217;s face looked serious. It was like it
		was watching the ending of a very sad movie.</p>

	<p>Han Sen did not have time to focus on God. Otherwise, he would end up watching tears fall from God&#8217;s eyes.
		God seemed to be very touched by the unfolding tragedy.</p>

	<p>What to do? The butterfly lady and Very High Leader are going to end up killing themselves. According to the
		wager, the butterfly lady will be dying because of Very High Leader. That means I will lose the bet&#8230; Han
		Sen&#8217;s heart flashed through many thoughts. He was trying to think of how to stop Very High Leader and the
		butterfly lady from dying together.</p>

	<p>Seeing the butterfly lady&#8217;s face, she seemed determined to die with Very High Leader. She was throwing her
		life away, and Han Sen did not know how to make her stop.</p>

	<p>At this time, Han Sen did not care much anymore. His body had a substance god light. He was going to stop the
		butterfly lady. He was not going to do anything that had her die with Very High Leader.</p>

	<p>Han Sen used all of his power to teleport over there. Before his body did that, he felt as if his body had been
		restricted by some invisible power. He could not go further than half a step.</p>

	<p>&#8220;That is the stage,&#8221; God coldly said. &#8220;Stay in the audience seats and watch the action unfold.
		It is quite a remarkable tragedy. It is beautiful. It is art. How could you think of destroying it?&#8221;</p>

	<p>Although Han Sen knew God would not permit him to interfere, at this time, he still felt very sad.</p>

	<p>Seeing that the butterfly lady and Very High Leader were severely injured, it wouldn&#8217;t be long before they
		died together. Although Han Sen could not move his body, he did not want to give up just yet. He shouted at the
		butterfly lady, &#8220;Butterfly Lady! It does not matter if you hate or love him, but if he treats you like
		this and you treat him like that, don&#8217;t you think you are being too nice?&#8221;</p>

	<p>The butterfly lady was almost insane. Aside from Very High Leader, it seemed as if she could not see or hear
		anything.</p>

	<p>Seeing the butterfly lady not move, Han Sen continued to shout, &#8220;Look at him now! Does it look like he
		regrets what he has done? He does not know your pain. He does not know that your pain is worse than death. If
		you kill him now, that means you are setting him free. Do you really want that?&#8221;</p>

	<p>The butterfly lady stopped. Her face was sad and pale as she looked back at Han Sen. She stared at Han Sen and
		asked, &#8220;How can I make him suffer and die as painfully alone as I will?&#8221;</p>

	<p>Han Sen saw the butterfly lady respond to him and was happy, but he was holding it in not to answer immediately.
		He paused for a while and said, &#8220;In your heart, he is your favorite. The pain of having the favorite be
		taken away is something only you can feel right now. You must make him feel the same pain. Only then will it be
		as meaningful.&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;But I already mean nothing to him. How am I supposed to make him feel this pain?&#8221; The butterfly lady
		sounded full of hatred.</p>

	<p>&#8220;So, if you were dead, it would not matter to him. You must take something away from him that he loves.
		Only then will he realize the pain he has caused you.&#8221; Han Sen tried to entice her.</p>

	<p>The butterfly lady&#8217;s eyes turned bright. She stared at Han Sen as she asked, &#8220;Do you know what he
		likes the most?&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;Of course,&#8221; Han Sen said. &#8220;Of course, I know. Isn&#8217;t what he loves the most is what has
		taken him away from you?&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;What?&#8221; The butterfly lady did not understand Han Sen.</p>

	<p>&#8220;He gave you up because he was looking for the path of Sky and Men Combined Together,&#8221; Han Sen said.
		&#8220;If you break the path he wants to pursue, wouldn&#8217;t that make him feel more pain than death?&#8221;
	</p>

	<p>The butterfly lady gnashed her teeth as she asked, &#8220;Won&#8217;t killing him sever that path?&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;No, no, no. If you kill him, he won&#8217;t feel anything,&#8221; Han Sen said. &#8220;He needs to remain
		alive but without hope. He needs to feel as hopeless as you do now that you have been abandoned. Only then will
		he feel the pain.&#8221;</p>

	<p>The butterfly lady&#8217;s eyes turned bright as she asked, &#8220;How do I make him feel hopeless and full of
		pain?&#8221;</p>
