Han Sen didn’t believe him, but he hadn’t yet tried the test that Yu Shanxin had suggested. He wanted to help Lone Bamboo, but he wasn’t going to the Very High on his friend’s behalf.

Seeing Han Sen leave, Yu Shanxin smiled. He did not get mad at Han Sen’s rejection.

Back on the small jade island, Han Sen continued to absorb King genes. He wanted to get The Story of Genes to the ninth tier as soon as he could.

Han Sen called Gu Qingcheng over to discuss the matter of Lone Bamboo. Gu Qingcheng listened to his tale and said to him, “Yu Shanxin is correct. It doesn’t matter who ends up going, but Sky Palace will need to send someone else to the Very High. Their demand cannot be ignored.”

“Sky Palace has many people. Is it necessary for me to go?” Han Sen said. Gu Qingcheng shook her head. “It isn’t that simple. If it was, Sky Palace wouldn’t have put their beloved son in jail. I don’t think Sky Palace can choose which individual goes. They will need a person that interests the Very High. Otherwise, a swap won’t work. And that is why Yu Shanxin is trying to convince you.”

“I’m not stupid. I won’t go even if they personally invite me. And he wants me to beg before the Very High like I’m a slave?” Han Sen said with a lift of his lips.

“It isn’t like that. To normal people, going to the Very High is a grand opportunity. They are the ones who want to do the begging. You and Lone Bamboo are special. If you weren’t special, I don’t think the Very High would care as much as they do now,” Gu Qingcheng smiled as she spoke.

“Is there no other way?” Han Sen asked.

“That would depend on Sky Palace. If they don’t want to enter a disagreement with the Very High, they will have to send someone no matter what.”

The two of them discussed the matter a little more, but they were unable to come up with any ideas. Their power wouldn’t be nearly enough to go against the Very High. Whatever they tried would be ineffective.

“If Lone Bamboo hasn’t been taken away, that means there is room for negotiation. We will find a way to navigate through this.” Han Sen kept trying to think of a way to help Lone Bamboo as he practiced.

“Brother Han, there is a meeting with the Very High. Are you joining?” Yun Suyi asked with a look of anger. She had come over to visit the little jade island.

“What meeting?” Han Sen asked with confusion. He had been recovering there for some time, so he hadn’t heard a thing about a meeting Yun Suyi explained, “The younger Very High and Sky will be exchanging geno arts. They said there is to be a discussion, but it is more like the Very High will talk and we will just sit there listening.”

“What will they talk about?” Han Sen asked with curiosity.

“The geno arts of the Very High are very expansive. They know the geno arts of many races, so they can talk about anything.” “They’re really that good? Maybe I should go and listen, then.” Han Sen didn’t really want to go and listen to geno arts. He just wanted to confirm that this Exquisite was the same Exquisite he had encountered in the core area.

He established a time with Yun Suyi. The next night, Han Sen took Bao’er and Gu Qingcheng with him. He met up with Yun Suyi and some other people from Sky Palace. Together, they joined the meeting.

The meeting was taking place on Thousand Lake Island. That island was strange. Its center was a lake, and the lake’s water constantly spilled onto the lower levels of the island. The whole island was like a sloped collection of lakes.

The Very High held their meeting at the center of the lake. There was a lotus platform that was around the size of a soccer pitch. It was floating in the center of the lake, and there were pavilions scattered around it.

When Han Sen arrived, the meeting area was full of Sky Palace students. Most of the students could only listen from their pavilions. Some of the higher-class students were able to sit on the lotus platform itself to talk directly with the Very High.

They said they were going to occupy the same tables as everyone else, but the Very High were actually occupying the primary seats. The Sky Palace students could only sit to the side. And it was usually the Sky Palace students that had to ask questions. The Very High were always the ones answering. They were like teachers answering their students.

Thousand Feather Crane and the Yun sisters brought Han Sen and Gu Qingcheng to the lotus platform. The Sky Palace students knew all about Han Sen. They greeted him and immediately allowed him to take the finest seats.

Han Sen only wanted to find someplace random to sit down, but the people there were excited. The Sky Palace students kept pushing him forward, and so he couldn’t refuse them. He had to sit down someplace more distinguished.

It wasn’t like the students of Sky Palace forced him deliberately. Everyone knew about Han Sen fighting Meng Lie in the systems of chaos. There wasn’t a person in Sky Palace who hadn’t heard the story. He was a King class that could defeat Meng Lie. He deserved to take the number one seat, above the Sky Palace Kings and half-deifieds.

Plus, Han Sen was quite famous in Sky Palace. He and Lone Bamboo were called the knife and sword masters. They had become teachers. If Lone Bamboo wasn’t there, then it was natural for Han Sen to sit in the most respected position.

Not long after, both sides of the lotus platform were full of Sky Palace students. But the center seats were still empty.

“Do the Very High really think so highly of themselves?” a Sky Palace student asked coldly. It was because of Lone Bamboo that the Sky Palace students disliked the Very High. That meeting wasn’t going to be as cordial as previous ones. But while everyone discussed the Very High, a white jade carriage flew toward them. The jade beasts that pulled the carriage were like tigers of some sort. They looked almost like a mascot. They were obviously special.

When Han Sen looked the creatures over, he was surprised. He didn’t recognize what species the jade beasts belonged to, but when he felt their presence, he could immediately tell they were deifieds.There were six of those jade beasts pulling the carriage. That power was something even Sky Palace’s leader could appreciate. Han Sen was surprised by how strong these Very High must be when he saw their mode of transportation.

But Han Sen’s initial assumption that the carriage belonged to Exquisite was wrong. It was for the use of Very High who were visiting other races. Many Very High used it, so it didn’t belong to anyone in particular. The beast carriage drove over to the lotus platform. There, the beautiful jade car’s door opened. A man and a woman emerged.

Just as Han Sen thought, that woman was Li Keer’s Third Sister, Exquisite. But this time, it wasn’t Li Keer who was accompanying her. It was a man.

The man and the woman walked to the primary seats and bowed before everyone. The man said airily, “I am sorry to have kept you guys waiting. If there are no other matters to discuss, let us get on with it. If you have questions, ask them. My sister and I will try to answer every question we are posed.”

“He sounds way too cocky. He said this was an exchange, but it sounds more like a teacher talking to children,” Han Sen thought to himself.

While they were talking, Exquisite and the Very High man took a seat. The man looked at the Sky Palace students on both sides.

He saw Han Sen occupying the first seat with Gu Qingcheng next to him.

When the man looked at Gu Qingcheng’s face, his own face froze. He stared at her a little, and then pulled his gaze away.
