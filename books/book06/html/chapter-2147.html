<h2>Metal Giant God City</h2>
<h3>Chapter 2147</h3>
<figure><img src="../Images/gem.gif" alt="gem" id="gem" width="120"

<p>A giant city was nestled into the slopes of a metal mountain.
The city was made of the same black metal as the mountain, and it
looked like it had been carved from the mountain rather than
built.</p>
<p>When viewed from afar, the city and mountain blended together
until it was impossible to tell where one ended and the other
began.</p>
<p>Two metal peaks that were one thousand meters tall formed the
gateposts of that massive city. The two enormous doors made those
that passed between them feel like ants.</p>
<p>From far away, Han Sen could see that the title on the gate
read, “Metal Giant God City.” It was written in a language Han Sen
had seen in the geno universe before, but the words themselves
looked so powerful that it was easy to imagine them leaping to life
and sundering the skies of the world.</p>
<p>Seeing that giant city, crouching on the mountain like a beast,
Han Sen frowned and said, “This city is so big. Not even the
largest races I have seen would require the sort of space this
place provides.”</p>
<p>Kahn spoke in a hushed tone. “Long ago, the Giants were one of
the ten higher races. They were part of a group called the
Breakskies. The Breakskies had difficulty breeding, and their
population gradually decreased until they became extinct, aside
from a few who interbred with other races. We believe that this
city is a deified location that once belonged to the
Breakskies.”</p>
<p>After a pause, Kahn resumed his dialogue. “After entering the
city, we unearthed some text that made mention of the Breakskies.
The carvings revealed that this place was a Breaksky city, but at
some point, there was a battle that brought the city to ruin.
Oddly, while we were in the city, we discovered no remains or
corpses.”</p>
<p>Since the main gate was shut and no one had been able to open
it, Kahn led them to the left side of the city where there was a
broken wall. Without that broken wall, it seemed unlikely that
anyone would have made it inside.</p>
<p>Entering from above would doubtlessly have its own challenges.
The creatures that had built this city would have safeguarded
against that.</p>
<p>When they crossed over the wall, Han Sen noticed a few camps on
the other side. The camps looked as if they belonged to other
races, and indeed they did. Quite obviously, they belonged to the
Buddha, Dragon, and Destroyed.</p>
<p>It was odd that the other races hadn’t placed any guards at the
city’s broken wall. There was no sign of anyone being around,
actually.</p>
<p>“That’s weird. It looks like they’re not here anymore. Or is
this some kind of trap?” White Real looked at the camp with
concern.</p>
<p>Odds and ends were strewn about the camp. It didn’t seem like
there had been a fight, but it looked as if people had made a quick
getaway.</p>
<p>“This is not a trap. There really is no one here,” Yuya
said.</p>
<p>Han Sen took his team into the camp to have a look around. When
they determined that the other teams really were gone, they began
gathering up the numerous supplies and resources that the others
had left behind. The unhappy campers had left quite the store of
geno fluid in their camp.</p>
<p>“It looks like they really did leave in a rush. They did not
take the geno fluid with them.” Han Sen looked at Kahn.</p>
<p>Kahn understood Han Sen, and he quietly said, “When the Demon
first came here under the blue storm, we saw the Dragon. They had
vanished by the time the red storm ended, though. Perhaps they
found something big, and they were too excited to pack up and head
for the deeper recesses of the ruins. I wonder what could have made
them break camp so quickly?”</p>
<p>“Perhaps it wasn’t that they discovered something. Perhaps
something went awry, and whatever happened forced them to flee,”
Yuya said.</p>
<p>“It is possible. But we haven’t seen signs of fighting,” Kahn
mumbled, deep in thought. Then, he suddenly stopped.</p>
<p>It wasn’t just Kahn, either. Everyone in the group grew pale as
they looked back outside the city.</p>
<p>A multitude of red eyes hovered in the skies outside the city.
The eyes grew closer as they watched, revealing the bronze,
dragonfly-like bodies of the creatures soaring through the air.
They were five meters long, and a buzzing sound accompanied their
flight that set Han Sen’s teeth on edge.</p>
<p>There were so many of them that the swarm seemed endless. And
they were now headed for the broken wall.</p>
<p>“What is going on? This is the time of the blue storms! Why
would metal xenogeneic creatures appear at a time like this?” Yuya
looked at Kahn.</p>
<p>“I don’t know. We have never seen metal xenogeneics under a blue
storm before. And even during a red storm, they never approached
the city. This isn’t good… Let’s run!” Kahn cried. Then, he led the
Demon further into the ruins.</p>
<p>Han Sen and Yuya looked at each other. They took the Sky Palace
people into the ruins, as well.</p>
<p>Those dragonflies were as strong as Marquises, and their numbers
were legion. They could be fought off, possibly, but not without a
price being paid. It’d get dirty.</p>
<p>Sky Palace and the Demon Marquises headed for the shelter of the
ruins together. Kahn was leading, and he shouted as he ran, “There
is a palace up ahead. We can hide there!”</p>
<p>Han Sen had already seen the building he was referring to. The
palace was like a mountain itself. It was so large that Han Sen
figured even the blind could probably see it. But the palace’s
gates were shut, and he didn’t know if they could open them.</p>
<p>“I have been here before. There is a gap in the palace wall. We
can slide through, get inside, and barricade the entrance. A
bottleneck like that will be much easier to defend,” Kahn said, and
then ran for the other side of the palace.</p>
<p>Han Sen was emotionless throughout all this, but he led the Sky
Palace students after Kahn. Up ahead, he saw a giant cave. It was
shaped like a fist, and it seemed that it had been punched into the
metal wall.</p>
<p>The metal xenogeneics were coming fast, though. The teams had no
time to hesitate as they slid through the wall. Han Sen and Yuya
jerked the last of their people into the palace just as the
dragonfly metal xenogeneics buzzed toward them.</p>
<p>The Marquises that guarded the cave entrance released their
godlights, killing the two nearest metal xenogeneics.</p>
<p>Then a Demon Marquise summoned a giant shield to barricade the
entrance.</p>
<p>The metal xenogeneics slammed into the shield repeatedly, but
try as they might, it wasn’t going to let them through.</p>
<p>Han Sen quickly looked around the palace they had stumbled into.
It appeared to be some sort of side room, but before he could
examine it further, his attention was drawn to the bodies lying on
the floor. The corpses were both Dragons and Buddhas, and it looked
as if they had died gruesome deaths.</p>
<p>Their scales and skin had been stripped from their bodies, but
strangely, their flesh was left whole. There was blood everywhere,
though. The sight washed over the teams in a horrible chill. Even
Han Sen, who saw blood often, felt sick.</p>
