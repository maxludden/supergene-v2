    <p>
      Han Sen was given many different options of gifts to consider off the Qin
      family. Eventually, he settled on Z-Steel raw stones.
    </p>

    <p>
      The Z-Steel ore always had a lot of contaminants inside it. A thousand
      grams of Z-Steel ore could be refined to provide only five grams of pure
      Z-Steel metal.
    </p>

    <p>
      The Z-Steel that was refined was really hard, but very brittle. Its
      fragility and stern rigidity rendered it almost unusable as a weapon or
      electrical component.
    </p>

    <p>
      Refined Z-Steel was more akin to delicate porcelain than metal. It had to
      be combined with other metals to provide a decent weapon of fair toughness
      and hardness.
    </p>

    <p>
      But inside the Z-Steel ore, there was a high concentration of rough
      Z-Steel. It was unknown how these Z-Steel raw stones were created, but
      they were a little bigger than a man&#8217;s thumb. Inside them was 50%
      Z-Steel. Some were even higher, though, and could reach 90%.
    </p>

    <p>
      The Z-Steel raw stones were not only really hard, but also really
      flexible. They were suitable for weaponry that way. When the raw stones
      were refined, however, they would end up very brittle. Thus, they could
      only be ground; they couldn&#8217;t be melted down and forged into a
      weapon.
    </p>

    <p>
      These raw stones were often made into bullets, but guns could not be used
      in a shelter, so the Z-Steel raw stones had no use there.
    </p>

    <p>
      But the Qin family owned many Z-Steel mines. They had a lot of Z-Steel raw
      stones, large ones in particular.
    </p>

    <p>
      The best batch of raw stones provided a concentration of 90% Z-Steel. They
      were bigger than ordinary Z-Steel raw stones, as well, and they could be
      ground into something simple.
    </p>

    <p>
      The moment Han Sen saw the Z-Steel raw stones, his mind turned to his
      peacock crossbow. The Z-Steel was one foot long at the most, and they were
      as thick as a finger. They were too thin to be made into knives and too
      hard to be sharpened.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen thought he would only need to grind the raw stone to create many
      new, good bolts. As such, they would be a very useful gift for Han Sen to
      receive.
    </p>

    <p>
      When Han Sen chose the Z-Steel raw stones, the Qin family also promised
      they would aid him in the creation of bolts, for grinding Z-Steel raw
      stone was very complicated work. It would take a long time for the process
      to be completed, and as a result, it would be a while before Han Sen
      received the bolts.
    </p>

    <p>
      The Qin family estimated in about half a month, they would have finished
      work on two bolts. So, the Qin family would give him two bolts every
      month.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen understood that, since the Z-Steel raw stone was so hard. It was
      non-reactive to heat, so it could not be melted down. It could only be
      ground down, slowly, over much time.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen highly anticipated the day he would receive his first Z-Steel
      bolts. They had a 90% concentration of Z-Steel, and their toughness would
      undoubtedly be better than the raven feathers.
    </p>

    <p>
      The most important distinction between the two different types of bolts he
      was about to own, however, was that he could not bring the raven bolts out
      of the shelter, whereas the Z-Steel bolts could be taken everywhere.
    </p>

    <p>
      After this, Han Sen quietly returned to the Goddess Shelter and put away
      the Beetle Knight. He then went to the Alliance to search for information.
      He wanted to catch a lead on where he might find a second generation solo
      super creature.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Brother, did you sign up for Divinity&#8217;s Bout?&#8221; Tang
      Zhenliu said excitedly, after contacting Han Sen.
    </p>

    <p>&#8220;No, it would be a waste of time.&#8221; Han Sen smiled.</p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Why not? You should give it a go; you have a kick-ass pet, after
      all. There&#8217;s a chance you&#8217;ll reach a rank in the ten Son of
      God&#8217;s and make humanity proud,&#8221; Tang Zhenliu said.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;My pet is strong, that much is true. But if I face an opponent
      stronger than I, I&#8217;ll be killed. I&#8217;ll be dead. Why should I
      bother?&#8221; Han Sen shrugged.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;I suppose you are correct. But if you don&#8217;t go compete in
      Divinity&#8217;s Bout, it is practically guaranteed that humanity once
      again will fail and not stand a chance of securing a single position. It
      has been a century, and across that entire time, the top ten Son of
      God&#8217;s have been spirits. It&#8217;s humiliating, at this
      point,&#8221; Tang Zhenliu said, with a depressed look.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;That&#8217;s just how it has to be. Unless we are able to somehow
      max out our super geno points, we will continue to be unable to compete
      with them,&#8221; Han Sen said, with a smile.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;That is hard, you know? A Life Geno essence has been discovered in
      the First God&#8217;s Sanctuary, but they have been unable to learn how to
      absorb it. The same thing has occurred here in the Second God&#8217;s
      Sanctuary, as well. When we&#8217;ll actually be able to start earning
      super geno points is very much still up-in-the-air at the moment,&#8221;
      Tang Zhenliu said, with an even greater look of depression.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Hopefully, it won&#8217;t be too long. I want to become a surpasser
      as soon as I can,&#8221; Han Sen said, with another smile.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;You have the most amazing luck, to have a pet like that. The next
      time you fight a super creature, consider us. Whatever the Qin family
      gives you, we can provide just as much. Maybe even better,&#8221; Tang
      Zhenliu said.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;We&#8217;ll talk about this when I am actually able to kill a super
      creature. And pets? You know pets. Pets are just pets. If the master is
      too weak, it would be dangerous to hunt a super creature, regardless of
      the pet&#8217;s individual strength. Unless victory is 100% sure, I
      wouldn&#8217;t risk it,&#8221; Han Sen said.
    </p>

    <p>…</p>

    <p>
      After the call with Tang Zhenliu, many others contacted him, wondering if
      he was going to participate in Divinity&#8217;s Bout. It looked as if many
      people wanted to see him compete there.
    </p>

    <p>
      A lot of people sincerely wanted Han Sen to become a Son of God to make
      humanity proud and have their race proudly displayed on the tablet.
    </p>

    <p>
      But Han Sen told them he wouldn&#8217;t take part in Divinity&#8217;s
      Bout. Many eyes watched Han Sen, though, and he couldn&#8217;t even though
      he wanted to.
    </p>

    <p>
      Many people didn&#8217;t believe Han Sen was willing to skip the affair,
      though. Han Sen only spent time in the Alliance or Goddess Shelter
      recently, it was believed. He hadn&#8217;t left either place for a while
      now, so the people who spied on him would know whether or not he signed up
      when the registrations closed. So, in time, it was inevitable that people
      would come to accept Han Sen really wasn&#8217;t signing up.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Hopefully, I really can become a Son of God. It&#8217;d be a
      marvelous thing if I were to obtain a super spirit.&#8221; Han Sen used
      his Beetle Knight to create a doppelganger, while he sneaked out on his
      own.
    </p>

    <p>
      Signing up as Dollar, he would only need to show off his powers and others
      would believe Dollar was the only person with super geno points. That
      would most certainly take the heat off Han Sen.
    </p>

    <p>
      But there was still a while to go before Divinity&#8217;s Bout began. And
      right now, they had to get through the preliminaries, where the best
      person from every shelter would be elected to move forward. Han Sen did
      not need to sign-up for this, as he was the first and only person in the
      Crystal Palace. So he opted to use this time to search for a second
      generation super creature.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen looked for information regarding one&#8217;s location and managed
      to get something. An evolver had made a post, which made Han Sen believe
      they had encountered a second generation super creature.
    </p>

    <p>
      That super creature resided someplace on Devil&#8217;s Mountain. That
      wasn&#8217;t too far from his current location, so Han Sen decided to
      scope it out. If it was a solo second generation super creature, now was
      his chance.
