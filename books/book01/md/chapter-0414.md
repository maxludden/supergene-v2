Han Sen was scared by the idea that Shura might be able to survive in God’s Sanctuary.

Shura’s physique was much better than human in the first place. If they were able to survive in God’s Sanctuary and gain geno points, the consequences would be dire.

Shura had always been conducting research in this aspect, but they had not made much progress. Meanwhile, the Alliance was doing its best to prevent Shura from entering God’s Sanctuary.

Because of the damages Shura would suffer from entering God’s Sanctuary and human occupation of most of the shelters, Shura had almost no chance at it.

Some Shura had risked their lives and tried to enter God’s Sanctuary, but they were doomed once spotted by human. After all, Shura almost had no ability to fight was entering God’s Sanctuary. The moment they were seen, they would be killed.

Even if they were not found, they would die of sickness in a couple days.

"Maybe Shura had overcome the issue of surviving God’s Sanctuary?" Han Sen felt a chill. If that was true, then a disaster would fall on human.

An ordinary Shura adult had the same physique as a human evolver. And a strong Shura fighter would be the same as a human surpasser. With such physique, it would be easy for Shura to kill all creatures and leave none for human.

Among black, white, golden, and purple horns, purple horns were the Shura royalties who had the strongest physique. Once older than ten, they could be over 100 in fitness index.

Although Han Sen did not know how old this Shura woman was, she must be more than ten years old, which meant she definitely had a fitness index beyond 100.

Once Shura like her entered in First God’s Sanctuary and started a fight with human, Han Sen could imagine what would happen.

Even Han Sen who only had a fitness index below thirty could already become invincible in First God’s Sanctuary. Ordinary super creatures only had a fitness index over forty.

If the number became over 100… Han Sen was covered in cold sweat on the thought as unspeakable fear filled his heart. It was beyond his personal interests. If Shura were able to survive in First God’s Sanctuary, it would be the nightmare for the entire mankind.

Han Sen could not bear to think of that kind of tragedy. He was a man, with his family, friends, and loved ones in God’s Sanctuary, so he had to think of the worst possibility.

The Shura woman got herself a bowl of meat with soup and realized that she still had her mask on when she tried to eat. She took the mask off and put it away.

Han Sen then saw her face and was dazed. Although judging from her small purple horns, Han Sen knew she was probably young, he did not realize how young she was. She was about fourteen or fifteen years old, her face round and skin so fair that it was almost transparent. The look in her eyes was quite innocent. Because Shura girls developed early in general, she had a curvaceous body, which made Han Sen feel she was older.

Her waist-length black hair was tied back. If it was not for her purple horns, she would just be considered a pretty girl.

However, because of the horns, Han Sen did not dare to consider her as a girl. Even though she was just around fifteen years old, her fitness index was definitely over 100 as a Shura royalty.

This sweet girl was actually as fierce as Queen, more destructive than super creatures in First God’s Sanctuary.

As Han Sen was checking her out, she sat down on something covered by a piece of cloth and started to gobble from the bowl in her hand as fast as the holy angel did.

In a short while, she finished all the food in the bowl. When she got up to get more, the piece of cloth was moved, unveiling what was underneath.

Han Sen was shocked with just a sneak peek.

Under the cloth was a shining yellow crystal the size of a boulder. Han Sen was very familiar with this kind of crystal. He had seen many of these recently, which were the life essence of super creatures. Although Han Sen only caught a glimpse, he was certain that it must be life essence. Judging by the shape of the cloth, there were at least two pieces of life essence underneath.

Han Sen stared at them without a blink. Although he now had the ability to kill a super creature, it took him a lot of time to find one. He wanted life essence bad.

Looking at the Shura girl, Han Sen gave up the thought. Han Sen could not understand why the Shura girl did not eat the life essence. However, there was no way Han Sen could beat her. Not even with the holy angel and the golden rock worm king helping him. A fitness level of over 100 was simply matchless in First God’s Sanctuary.

Han Sen was always decisive. Although the temptation was huge, he merely hesitated for a moment before he decided to leave quietly. He had to report the existence of Shura to the Alliance, making sure that the Alliance was prepared.

Han Sen alone could not stop something as big as this. If Shura was really able to overcome the damages they suffered from God’s Sanctuary, then the entire Alliance must be rallied up against them.

In addition, this Shura girl was even able to control a super creature, which was shocking.

As Han Sen was trying to leave, to his surprise, the Shura girl suddenly let out a scream. He turned to look at her and saw her kneeling on the floor, moaning in pain.

Her body kept shaking as she huddled up.

The evil goblin and the white rhinoceros seemed to be so scared that they each ran away into a stone channel like rabbits. However, they did not dare to go far, but stayed in their own place shivering, checking on the Shura girl from time to time.

*Bang!*

Han Sen heard a loud noise. The Shura girl who was holding her head and moaning in pain suddenly started to bang her head against the floor, smashing the rock into pieces. Although the rock was broken, her head was not even red, but only got dirty with some dust on it.

*Bang! Bang! Bang!*

Han Sen watched the girl hitting her head against the rock repeatedly and was shocked.

It is Shura girl a lunatic? Watching the Shura girl banging her head on the floor, Han Sen could not help feeling an urge to kill her. She looked like she was having a reoccurrence of some disease. Maybe he could take the opportunity to kill her.
