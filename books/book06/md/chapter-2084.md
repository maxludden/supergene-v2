Han Sen hesitated, wondering if he should keep going. The gourds were having a very strong reaction, and he was afraid something might happen.

But since he was already out on the vine, going back didn’t seem like a good idea. He had to press on with Bao’er.

The movement of the gourd vines was shocking all of Sky Palace. The Sky Palace leader, who was in the middle of practice, opened his eyes. The nobles and the elders watched the shaking gourd vine via their own means. Even the Dream Beast woke up from his slumber to look at Bao’er, who was being carried on Han Sen’s chest.

In the tower of a jade city, a green-clothed man stood alone. He watched the gourd vine and looked surprised.

The Sky Palace gourd vine was a deified plant. Even if a deified elite came, it wouldn’t have that reaction unless the elite was a hostile.

But now, it was having such a drastic reaction to Han Sen and his child. Something like this had never occurred before. “What is this? What’s happening to the gourd vine?” Yun Suyi asked with confusion.

No one could answer her question, though. So, Yun Suyi continued to watch in shock as Han Sen and his daughter crossed the madly-shaking gourd vine.

Suddenly, a gourd that was as big as a stove began to shine. A sword-light came out of the gourd and went straight for Bao’er, who was in Han Sen’s arms.

Han Sen was thrilled. This was not like the first time, where he had no clue about anything that was going on. He knew the gourd had approved of her, and it had given her a holy gourd sword air to practice swords with.

When Han Sen had walked across it the first time, the gourds shook, but they did not give him anything.

A lady with a black mask, next to Sky Palace leader, said in surprise, “It seems as if Han Sen’s daughter is a natural. She has managed to trigger the holy gourd’s sword air. She really has the talent. This is most fortuitous for the prestige of Sky Palace.”

The Sky Palace leader nodded, but he did not say anything. He felt as if the gourd had moved too much, and that was nothing normal.

The elders stared with stunned expressions.

“It is no wonder she is Han Sen’s daughter. She can trigger the holy gourd sword air. She will achieve many great feats with a sword.”

“Han is strong, and he has a daughter that can trigger the holy gourd sword air. The leader will consider him even more important now.”

“But it is a shame that her genes are not stable, just like Han Sen’s. Her core genes are similar to his own. It will be difficult for her to practice.”

“I don’t know if she will ever become deified, but being a King would be amazing enough. That’s a rare feat.”

While everyone discussed this, the holy gourd sword air touched down on Bao’er’s forehead. It surrounded Bao’er, making her glow with a holy sword air.

Then another gourd lit up. A holy gourd knife air was coming straight at Bao’er.

“Look! Another gourd has been triggered. This time it is a knife air. She is talented with knives, too?” the black-masked woman asked in utter disbelief.

It was rare to trigger two gourds with different holy airs, which meant Bao’er had great talent with knives and swords. She could learn with those much faster than an ordinary creature.

“Han Sen is a knife and sword master, and it seems his daughter is just as proficient. Genes are very important.”

“It is a shame that Han Sen is not a genuine student of ours. These two could earn a lot of glory for us.”

“They are not our family, but the connection between the leader and Knife Queen make it close enough.”

“Han Sen’s daughter has no master, and Han Sen has only been a member for a short while. Can his daughter still enter Sky Palace?”

“Yeah, but the leader took Lone Bamboo as a student. He cannot take on any more. I don’t know who her master will end up being.”

“With this talent, no elder would reject the prospect of accepting her as a student.”

“Not bad. Not bad. This child is talented. She has talent with swords and knives. She will become very strong in the future.” A King with a white beard laughed.

Another King nodded. “This girl is good, but her talent is different from my own powers. If we were more compatible, I would take her as my student.”

An elder laughed and said, “It is a shame she is not of the Sky. Otherwise, I would take her as a student. She may be talented, but she is still a crystallizer. Her genes are unstable. For her, gaining strength will require far more effort than usual.”

As everyone discussed all this, the gourd vine shone again. A gourd spat out even more holy air.

That holy air had lightning in it. When it reached Bao’er, it was like she was getting thunderstruck.

The observers were frozen upon seeing this. They spoke to themselves, saying, “She has talent with thunder, too? How powerful is she?”

Before they could wrap their minds around what they were seeing, more lights came out of the gourd vine. Whenever Han Sen and Bao’er moved, all the gourds spat out holy air at Bao’er’s forehead.

There was gold, wood, water, fire, earth, knife, sword, lance, spear, trident, wind, rain, thunder, lightning, sun, moon, and galaxy.

All those holy airs swirled around the pair on the vine, masking the entire path in a holy aura. The gourds were shining so bright, they lit up the entirety of Sky Palace. The holy airs hovered around Bao’er, waiting for their chance to land on her.

Frozen. Everyone was frozen. The elders, the leader, and Dream Beast stood as still as statues. The whole of Sky Palace was silent and unmoving.

Ever since Sky Palace was established, many geniuses had walked the Sky Road. There were some deified ones, but even those only acquired holy airs from a couple of gourds.

When ordinary geniuses went past, they’d be extremely lucky just to receive one.

But now, all those holy gourd airs were queuing up to give Bao’er what they had. They were like dumplings being thrown at Bao’er’s forehead. Bao’er’s body was full of holy air. She was like a fog, but becoming solid.

“Am I dreaming?” one of the Kings mumbled. He watched the holy airs twirl around Bao’er like a tornado. He couldn’t close his mouth.
