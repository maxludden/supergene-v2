  1697 Beyond Expectations

Golden Growler was like Han Sen. He hadn’t matured after ascending, and his fitness was worse than Gugia’s and Buck’s. But the power of his geno armor closed the gap and fixed this issue. Golden Growler and his gold geno armor were quite compatible, and the creature could make use of 60% of its power. That was higher than Gugia’s compatibility with his. It was through this large buff that he could beat Gugia.

Gugia acknowledged this, and his face looked grim. The onlookers Rudy and Yake had the same expression, too. They had no way of expecting there’d be a geno armor creature dining with Han Sen, let alone one with such incredible strength.

Gugia grunted. He jumped up like a silver shadow and avoided Golden Growler’s attack. He went behind Golden Growler and attacked his head.

“Mere power is not the end-all-be-all.” Gugia looked cold. His fist was right on the precipice of coming into contact with Golden Growler’s head.

But in the next second, Gugia noticed Golden Growler was no longer in front of him. He’d disappeared. His target was missing.

Golden Growler hadn’t actually disappeared, though. He just became smaller, shrinking to a size that was a better match for fighting Gugia. If his current size was compared to that of an elephant, he now reduced his size to something that was more like an ant It because of this, Gugia lost his target.

When Gugia reconfirmed his foe’s location, Golden Growler was running like mad. He flashed by Gugia like lightning, his claws leaving rips in Gugia’s armor that leaked blood.

Golden Growler had gotten smaller, but his speed increased. He changed from a strength-type to a speed-type.

When Gugia fought Golden Growler, he was constantly suppressed by the lion. Golden Growler could switch between strength and speed on a whim, and it gave Gugia a proper headache.

“Rudy, make it quick!” Yake frowned at Rudy as Golden Growler appeared and disturbed their plan.

Rudy nodded, and a sky-blue geno armor appeared on him. His devilish body flew forward. Suddenly, he moved behind Golden Growler, sandwiching the lion between himself and Gugia.

As Rudy moved toward Golden Growler, a holy light shone from the garden. The next second, an ange卜like woman wrth holy armor appeared. Her hands were like swords, slashing down toward his fists.

Katcha!

Rudy noticed his gauntlets were broken. His skin was cut and bleeding.

“Another powerful geno armor creature.” Rudy’s face looked ill.

The humble Han family had hidden two creatures with geno armor in their midst That was beyond what anyone had expected. It was already difficult to become a god, let alone gain geno armor.

God’s Organization, from the time of its establishment, had only managed to collect ten. There were two right here, and they sure looked mighty powerful.

Yake frowned. Things were definitely not going as expected. Han Jinzhi hadn’t appeared, and they had already lost three god-class creatures. Rudy and Gugia were suppressed now, as well.

Han Yufei was in shock. He had thought that Han Sen had killed Snake Witch, but he did not expect Han Sen to have two creatures with geno armor that might have done the task for him. And there they were now, suppressing Rudy and Gugia.

Ji Yanran was so happy. Little Angel and Golden Growler were attacking, and the dangerous fight looked like something petty that would soon be over. Stay Up Late looked at Little Angel and Golden Growler strangely. He already thought the Han family was weird, but this was weirder than even he had expected.

Stay Up Late could tell their geno armors were not their own, though. “Two beings that have been approved to use geno armor… If they could generate their own, could they be qualified?”

Little Angel and Golden Growler suppressed Rudy and Gugia. Yake’s eyes changed then, and his body began to transform. It seemed as if he wanted to fight and sort out this situation out himself.

Han Yufei knew Han Sen was not there. And he didn’t suspect the Han family might actually have a third geno armor to fight against Yake.

Han Yufei knew Yake was stronger than Rudy and Gugia, though. He was at an even higher tier in God’s Organization.

Han Yufei looked like he cared little for the fight. He kept watching Yake. And just as Yake was about to attack, Han Yufei gathered up a massive amount of power and punched him from behind.

The silent and powerful punch was driven right into Yake’s back.

Han Yufei hadn’t generated geno armor, and his fitness was similar to Buck’s. He had to find an effective way to assassinate Yake.

When Yake was about to strike, that was the time his guard would be lowered. He’d only have one chance of taking him out. And that chance would be gone for good if Yake thought about putting on his geno armor.

Han Yufei was not cocky enough to think he could defeat Yake when he was wearing his geno armor. Geno armors were not all the same, or on the same level.

Boom!

Han Yufei’s fist went right into Yake’s back. It was powerful enough to sunder a mountain, but his face swiftly changed.

Such powerful strength landed on Yake, and yet, Yake had suddenly donned a steel looking armor. His punch went against it, dealing zero damage. And it was like his hand had gotten stuck inside the metal. He couldn’t get it back out

“You have a problem.” Yake turned around to look at Han Yufei. His expression was murderous.

Han Yufei did not talk, and he simply threw another fist at his enemy’s body.

Yake grabbed Han Yufei’s hand, though, and proceeded to speak. “You think I’m like one of them? You are very wrong. Your skills might work against the likes of Rudy, but to me, it was a really dumb move. I have self geno armor, and that is a very different thing.”

After that, Yake used his hand to break Han Yufei’s arm. Han Yufei’s face turned white as his arm was twisted. He started to develop a cold sweat His fist could not reach Yake, and neither could he run off.

“Goto hell!” Yake’s other fist was fast-approaching Han Yufei’s head with power.
