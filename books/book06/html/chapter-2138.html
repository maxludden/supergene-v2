<h2>Endless Sky Path</h2>
<h3>Chapter 2138</h3>

<p>Han Sen felt the purple godlight wrap around him. He was
restricted, and just like before, he was unable to move a muscle.
Since Lone Bamboo was using the godlight as a Marquise, Han Sen
doubted that he would be able to last very long.</p>
<p>But if Lone Bamboo could keep it up for even just a second, that
would be enough time for him to defeat Han Sen with a single
attack.</p>
<p>Han Sen tried to struggle out of the light’s grasp or break it,
but all his attempts failed.</p>
<p>“I need to research the Purple Eye Butterfly’s sealing light. I
can’t depend on super god body to bail me out all the time.” Han
Sen thought about Purple Eye Butterfly, and then his mind raced
back to the beast soul he had received. He decided to give it a
look.</p>
<div class="tables">

<!-- Deified Beast Soul: Purple Eye Butterfly (Spectacles-type) --></div>
<p>“Spectacles? Is this some kind of lenses? Like an ordinary pair
of glasses that you can wear when you go out?” Han Sen thought, as
he prepared to summon the beast soul.</p>
<p>It was the only deified beast soul that he had. If he used it as
Dollar, and other people saw it, he’d be unable to use it as his
real self, Han Sen. If he didn’t absolutely have to use it, Han Sen
did not want to expose it to the public now and risk identifying
himself.</p>
<p>“Purple Eye Butterfly’s godlight is rather strong. I can’t
maintain it very long as a Marquise.” Lone Bamboo looked at Han
Sen, but he did not make a move.</p>
<p>“Then don’t waste time,” Han Sen responded suddenly. A gold
light enveloped Han Sen and turned his gold armor translucent, and
he stepped through the purple godlight like it wasn’t even
there.</p>
<p>“The purple eye godlight didn’t work?” The audience gaped.</p>
<p>Purple Eye Butterfly was one of Sacred’s ten generals. His power
placed him among the greatest elites, and that was especially true
of his purple eye godlight. It might have been the best sealing
power in the entire universe. If the deified elites did not have a
way of blocking or avoiding that light, they’d be restricted from
making a single move and rendered helpless.</p>
<p>Lone Bamboo was only Marquise, though, so the purple eye
godlight wasn’t very strong. But against someone of the same level,
there shouldn’t have been a problem at all.</p>
<p>But Han Sen had easily broken the purple eye godlight.
Witnessing something like that was incredibly scary.</p>
<p>“That is the power! That is Dollar!” Yisha, seeing Han Sen make
use of super god spirit, became infuriated.</p>
<p>When Han Sen entered super god spirit mode, his body exuded a
most terrifying presence.</p>
<p>Beneath the purple eye godlight, Han Sen pointed at Lone Bamboo
with his finger. A power gathered upon his fingertip.</p>
<p>It looked as if they were both partners in a dance, as Lone
Bamboo opened his Sky eye at the same moment. Then, blood washed
over his body like an ocean wave. It painted his entire form,
drenching him. It also combined with his purple armor and wings.
His entire body was purple and red now, as if he was standing in a
bloodlight.</p>
<p>Lone Bamboo lifted his finger as well, pointing it at Han Sen
like a sword. His body was red and purple, but the sword air was
devoid of color. It was invisible. If his sword air hadn’t been
under the red and purple light, the crystal-looking sword would
have been completely invisible to people, as well.</p>
<p>“…from Textless Book.” The Sky Palace leader noticed the sword
air amassing on Lone Bamboo’s finger and gasped. With eyes wide
open, he stared at his fingers.</p>
<p>“No way… How long has he been practicing? He has learned ?! Are
you sure…?” The woman with a black mask looked at the leader with
an expression of utter disbelief.</p>
<p>The Sky Palace leader laughed. It sounded like nonsense, but he
said, “Haha! Of course I’m sure. He is my student. He’s been
studying the core of from the Textless Book ever since becoming a
Marquise. He is a good student, and I’m telling you; there is no
one stronger than him in this universe…”</p>
<p>“He learned that at this age… Sky Palace is that fortunate…”
mumbled Burning Lamp Alpha. He was not looking good at all.</p>
<p>“Sky Palace has a bullshit amount of luck.” Many of the older
people that watched, when seeing this, became seething mad with
jealousy.</p>
<p>Textless Book was difficult to learn. By only learning twenty
percent of its contents, a student could rule the world. But
learning the core of was even more difficult. Not many of the Sky
had learned the Textless Book, and even fewer knew much about . The
handful of people who had learned it were King class.</p>
<p>The Sky Palace leader learned when he was a Duke, and people
believed he was the most impressive genius in existence for having
done so.</p>
<p>But now that Lone Bamboo had learned it as a Marquise, it was a
bit of an understatement to say that people were shocked.</p>
<p>Han Sen and Lone Bamboo were both building power. The red and
white powers were like two gods, burning with rage for one-another.
Even looking at them was terrifying.</p>
<p>Both of their powers peaked, and then they moved.</p>
<p>Han Sen looked like a god with his finger raised. It wasn’t a
beautiful technique to witness being performed, but it was
incredibly fast. It was as simple as it was violent.</p>
<p>Lone Bamboo thrust his finger forward, too. The sword air headed
towards Han Sen with all the power of a runaway locomotive.</p>
<p>Katcha!</p>
<p>The powers both went right by each other, and when they did, the
audience heard a sound like an egg cracking. Lone Bamboo’s armor of
red light shattered into dust, but Dollar was totally fine.</p>
<p>“I lost. Thanks.” Lone Bamboo nodded to Han Sen seriously, then
tore up his paper. He vanished from the stage of the Geno Being
Scroll.</p>
<p>“Impossible… How could lose? That was the essence of Sky Path.
You can time travel with it. How could anyone lose with it…” The
Sky Path leader stared at the Geno Being Scroll, at a complete
loss. He could not believe what he had just witnessed.</p>
<p>He knew precisely how powerful was, and that was why he was so
shocked.</p>
<p>"…lost.” Many of the old elites were shocked by this, too. They
looked upon the gold body inside the Geno Being Scroll with
trepidation.</p>
<p>“Human… Dollar…” Countless eyes stared at those two words,
transfixed. The audience was a huge wash of emotion, including
everything from jealousy to admiration to fear.</p>
<p>Boom!</p>
<p>The Geno Being Scroll’s river broke. And then, Dollar
disappeared from sight. After that, a video played across the
bronze scroll.</p>
<p>The video replayed Dollar’s fights. Every elite stared at
Dollar’s Geno Being fights intently, as each one was being replayed
consecutively, until the final one where he reached first
place.</p>
<p>No one had thought the final victor of the Marquise tier would
be a human named Dollar. Every Noble looked at the final result,
unsure how they should respond.</p>
