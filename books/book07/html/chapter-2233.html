<h2>Three Bai Sema</h2>
<h3>Chapter 2233</h3>

<p>“DIe!” Night River King looked murderous. His hatred for Han Sen
was burning, and he wanted nothing more than to grind Han Sen into
dust.</p>
<p>Ancient God Statue’s power was not unlimited. The statue Edward
had given him only provided the power to fuel one grand attack.
After one attack, the Ancient God Statue would vanish, but one
attack would be enough for Night River King. He only needed to use
the incredible statue’s power to break the Bai Sema. Even if Han
Sen wasn’t killed by it, Night River King thought he could lay
waste to them all within a short amount of time through his own
power when they were no longer protected by the Bai Sema.</p>
<p>His power was almost like a fully fledged deified’s power. It
didn’t give Han Sen the chance to dodge it. He watched the
blue-gold Demon Bug King Bai Sema get cut through like tofu by the
golden wheel.</p>
<p>Night River King looked excited as it occurred. He kept slashing
with his Moon Wheel Blade. As this transpired, a yellow and green
light manifested. It combined with the blue Bai Sema to make it a
tricolored Bai Sema, and those colors pushed back against the
hurricane of gold.</p>
<p>Katcha!</p>
<p>The golden wheel power, which was akin in strength to a
deified’s, went up against the tricolored Bai Sema. The golden dust
and the three colors spilled everywhere like a vibrant
firework.</p>
<p>The golden wheel cut through the tricolored Bai Sema, but at a
much slower pace. It was like a grinding wheel had gotten stuck
inside rocks made of steel. Its cutting speed was much slower.</p>
<p>“Die!” Night River King could sense the tricolored Bai Sema’s
might, and its presence had given him a fright. He used his own
power to sprint forward, wishing he could cut through the Bai Sema
and kill all of them inside it.</p>
<p>The giant golden wheel kept pressing down while Night River King
roared. It slowly cut the tricolored Bai Sema. Some of its exterior
was shredded open, as the scary gold wheel did not relent in its
pressing cut against the Bai Sema. It cut the space inside the Bai
Sema. Han Sen and the others were in the back of the Bai Sema,
their backs against its wall, but the gold wheel was still able to
cut in. It broke the tricolored Bai Sema and cut through the fabric
of space to get at them, continuing forward toward Han Sen.</p>
<p>Because the tricolored Bai Sema’s defense was so high, it did
make the golden wheel slower. Han Sen and Bai Wei also used all
sorts of power against the gold wheel, hoping they could do
something to help the Bai Sema repel the attack, but before the
deified power, even Han Meng’er, who had a very destructive
personality, could only deal damage that was the equivalent of a
tickle to the wheel.</p>
<p>In their opposition against the wheel, Han Sen and his
companions’ powers were like ants going up against an elephant.
They were very small, but right now Han Sen could not put away the
tricolored Bai Sema to do something else. The tricolored Bai Sema
was stopping the gold wheel. If the tricolored Bai Sema was gone,
the speed and impact of the deified power would not give Han Sen
room to escape. He probably wouldn’t even have the chance to
teleport away. He’d be killed.</p>
<p>Seeing the gold wheel grinding them, Han Sen knew they had no
way out. The gold wheel cut open the tricolored Bai Sema, and it
continued going forward.</p>
<p>“Han Sen, let us end this feud right here!” Night River King
roared madly. The Moon Wheel Blade pressed down like crazy. Now,
Night River King was like a god that could not be stopped.</p>
<p>Katcha-cha!</p>
<p>The tricolored Bai Sema made a blender-like noise. It sounded
like it was grinding rocks, and the noise grew louder and
louder.</p>
<p>Han Sen and his companions were against the Bai Sema’s wall, and
they kept trying to attack the gold wheel. The gold wheel was in
front of them, grinding the space before them.</p>
<p>There were many space cracks almost reaching Han Sen’s body. Bai
Wei looked hopeless. She looked to be in utter shock. No matter how
arrogant she was, at the end of the day she was just a teenager.
Facing death and being powerless to stop it made her be unable to
control her emotions. Her head was a mess.</p>
<p>Han Sen kept thinking about how he might deal with the
situation. The deified power was way too strong, and what he was
dealing with now was far outside the realm of his being able to
stop it.</p>
<p>Kat-Kat… Cha-Cha…</p>
<p>As this happened, the gold wheel slowed down. It was now so
slow, and the gold color began to dim. It looked as if it were
dying.</p>
<p>The gold wheel’s impact against the tricolored Demon Bug King
Bai Sema lessened. It was now like a broken cutter. It kept
stopping, unable to keep going in a steady motion.</p>
<p>“How… is that possible…?” Night River King froze He could not
believe what he was seeing.</p>
<p>The tricolored Bai Sema was about to be cut open, and if that
happened, Han Sen would have no place to hide. As he saw that all
of this was about to come to an end, Night River King’s Ancient
Warrior light also started to flicker. Many cracks formed across
The Ancient Warrior Statue’s gold armor. It was on the verge of
breaking.</p>
<p>Night River King knew what was going on. It was the sign of the
Ancient Warrior Statue reaching its expiry point. He could not
believe that the tricolored shield could withstand the brutal force
of a deified attack.</p>
<p>Bai Wei was just as surprised. She had already been impressed by
the Demon Bug King Bai Sema, but now it had managed to block the
attack of an Ancient Warrior Statue. She was amazed by its
performance.</p>
<p>Han Sen and Han Yan were happy, too. One Demon Bug King Bai Sema
was a half-deified treasure. Han Sen did not believe the combined
effort of the tricolored Bai Sema could block a deified attack, but
seeing the truth of the matter now, it really had blocked the
attack, even though it had been dealt a lot of damage.</p>
<p>Pang!</p>
<p>Night River King’s Ancient Warrior Statue light was
extinguished. The gold light shattered into dust. The gold wheel
was gone, too. There was just some black water power left.</p>
<p>The tricolored Demon Bug King Bai Sema was gone, and the beast
souls were damaged. It would take a while for them to recover. The
tricolored Bai Sema was still not strong enough to challenge a
deified power.</p>
<p>“I did not expect you had three of those shields. That defense
is so strong! It is a shame that it could not kill you. But now you
don’t have the protection of any shield, and so you will die.”
Night River King looked so ugly, and his eyes looked to be filled
with greed.</p>
<p>Han Sen’s shield could block a deified attack, and while the
powerful treasures hadn’t been destroyed, they could not currently
be used. That meant Night River King thought he could kill them and
take the shield treasures for himself.</p>
<p>Night River King looked very greedy and murderous. He used his
black water power and the Moon Wheel Blade to create a black water
wheel. There was no Ancient Warrior Statue to power-up the attack,
but it was still a King-class power.</p>
