  Qin Yuan’s back had the shadow of a black dragon on it. It looked like it was there, but it was not there. It was in the mist. It did not look real.

Han Sen waved the Demon God Sword Spirit and mustered an invisible sword air to come lashing out at Qin Yuan. That sword air was unavoidable.

Dong!

The sword air struck Qin Yuan, but it was blocked three feet behind him. He could not stick it through.

The shadow of a dragon wrapped around Qin Yuan. It looked like it was there, but it was not there. It blocked the Demon God Sword Spirit’s invisible sword air. In the meantime, the An Yang Ting members spoke spells aloud as if they were honest believers.

When a few hundred An Yang Ting members spoke out a mysterious spell to the black air, the whole of Jade Wall City lit up. The giant man-made city, ringed by a jade wall, had many of its buildings glow with a mysterious light. If one looked closer, one would find that those lights were mystical spells.

The whole of the Jade Wall City looked like a real, giant dragon was surrounding it. That real dragon released light. It combined with Qin Yuan’s dragon shadow, making Qin Yuan’s body scarier.

Han Sen could not help but frown. Qin Yuan’s body power was not his alone. The power he had was scarier than an Annihilation God Spirit.

In the kingdom, Qin Jing Zhen looked strange. He seemed surprised and excited at the same time. “The old alpha has been pushed to this limit and used the Black Dragon Promise. Wow, he really has been pushed right to the

edge.”

The whole of Jade Wall City was in shock. Many old people, who had lived a few generations in Jade Wall City, looked at the old buildings around in confusion.

Jade Wall City had many old buildings. Regardless of how much they developed the city, these old buildings were never torn down or displaced.

The old courtyards houses, broken old temples, towers made of bricks, mottled churches, old monasteries, lots of small stone houses, and the newly built buildings that did not fit in with the architecture of the old buildings glowed with a scary light.

On the old, broken plaza, every stone plate glowed with a god light and a god presence. It was like some scary creature was waking up from olden times.

An old man strangely looked at the monastery with god light. He said to himself, “The stories my great-grandfather told me about were true. That old monastery is a mysterious

place.”

The citizens of Jade Wall City observed the old buildings around them. It was hard to believe.

The buildings glowing with a gold light were where they used to play. They would even defecate in such old houses.

The Qin Kingdom had grown stronger over the past thousand years. They rarely had to use the Black Dragon Promise’s power. In the past few decades, even the people of Jade Wall City had not been able to see the black dragon at work.

In an old temple, some old people started to chant.

In an old house, ghosts started to cry.

In a monastery, women were heard praying.

In the church, priests were praying to God.

Every mysterious place had scary power exploding out of it. It made Jade Wall City’s draconic shadows amplify their brightness. Qin Yuan’s dragon shadow started to look a lot more real. It was like a real black dragon flying above him.

The Demon God Sword Spirit in Han Sen’s hands had already been swung 10 times, and each time it had been blocked by Qin Yuan’s black dragon. It was unable to slash it at all.

Qin Yuan looked as if he had an infinite power buff. He was too scary to imagine.

Han Sen thought, “The Qin Kingdom is one of the seven kingdoms. I do not know how many billions of years it has lasted, but it really is very scary. For Jade Wall City to have this sort of protection power, it must make it just as strong as the power in an Annihilation-class god temple. Clearly, I underestimated the seven kingdoms that have remained here for billions of years.”

“Han Sen, you lied to the king! You have made friends in secret. You are always jealous. You kill the innocent. You trick the crown prince. Now, you want to take the Qin Kingdom’s suppression treasure. Are you not aware of the fact that is a big crime? It is certainly not forgivable. Thus, you should be killed!” Qin Yuan stood on the nine skies. A black dragon was circling his body. He looked like a god looking down on Han Sen as his god voice thundered through the skies. It was like the sound of a punishment being bestowed.

The Jade Wall City civilians and its many nobles, who had been attracted by the weird scenes concerning the old buildings, saw and heard all of this.

Because Han Sen was already famous for being an evil officer, this was all over Jade Wall City. The ordinary citizens who heard Qin Yuan speak and behave like a god with a streak for doling out judgment already had an impression in their minds. They hated Han Sen, so they shouted out about needing to kill the evil officer.

The loyal officers who really hated Han Sen all shouted, “God has eyes! Kill the evil officer!” This kind of slang was shared by everyone in Jade Wall City. They all gathered, wanting to see the evil man be killed.

Although Han Sen knew Qin Yuan was not speaking the truth, Han Sen did not bother trying to explain. He only looked at Qin Yuan, who was in the sky.

Qin Yuan could not be looked at. He was too strong. His hair was as white as snow. A god light shone around him. A black dragon was circling him. He was like the Qin Kingdom’s battle god that could protect the kingdom.

“Han Sen, what do you have to say for yourself?” Qin Yuan looked at Han Sen from high above.

In the kingdom, Qin Jing Zhen looked at Qin Yuan up in the sky. He felt doubtful. He looked as if he was wrestling with indecision.

Qin Bai ran toward him, crying and pleading. “Father, please save Han Sen. He is not a bad guy. He has never done anything bad. It was my fault. I always drag him into doing crazy things. This was not his fault.”

Qin Bai knew how scary the old alpha was, and he had seen this kind of formation before. It made him terrified.

Qin Jing Zhen looked at Qin Bai. He did not speak, but his eyes started to solidify

“Bai, my son, carry me out of the palace.” Qin Jing Zhen stood up. His eyes looked like they were on fire. He slowly spoke, word by word, “Save… Han… Sen…”

He did not want to go out for Han Sen. It was for his only son, Qin Bai. If Qin Yuan was not killed after he died, Qin Bai would be unable to control the kingdom.

Qin Bai was delighted to hear that. He crawled up to hold Qin Jing Zhen. Tear tracks still scored his face.

The father and the son, the two of them, wore casual clothing to leave the palace. Only one officer followed them. They didn’t draw the attention of anyone.

Qin Jing Zhen’s wounds had not been healed yet, so he could not walk fast. He walked for a while before coughing into a towel. He quickly put the towel away. He did not want Qin Bai to see it.

“Father, are you OK?” Qin Bai asked with worry.

“It is fine. Your father did not secure this country for your reign yet. I am fine.” Qin Jing Zhen laughed and said, “Let’s go. We cannot save Han Sen if we are too late.”

Hearing the need to save Han Sen, Qin Bai immediately asked, “How do we save Han Sen? How can we stop Old Alpha?”.

“He is not the one we have to stop.” Qin Jing Zhen looked at the old temple. He had Qin Bai help him get there.

Qin Jing Zhen led Qin Bai to the old temple. He had Qin Bai kneel before the stairs. They bowed three times. Afterward, Qin Jing Zhen said, “I am the Qin Kingdom’s king, Qin Jing Zhen. I have brought my son here to greet you. Please, take away the dragon air, Alpha.”
