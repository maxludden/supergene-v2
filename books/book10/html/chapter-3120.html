<p>Han Sen looked at Bald Guy and asked, “What is this land pulse’s
plum tree weird scene?”</p>
<p>Bald Guy touched his big, bald head. He looked rather
embarrassed as he said, “Although I cannot tell what this weird
scene is, I am pretty sure it is an amazing one.”</p>
<p>Han Sen looked disdainfully at him. Bald Guy wasn’t really
making much sense. Although he had never learned god-pulse skills,
he could tell there was something odd going on there. Li Bing Yu
was shocked. Via her observational talents, she knew the planet was
not one of the key god pulses of the Gold Crystal System. It should
not have been able to produce a powerful weird scene.</p>
<p>But that plum tree was far too strange. It was hard for people
to imagine.</p>
<p>“Do not think about it too much. Let’s just dig it out of the
ground. There must be some good stuff here. Perhaps we will even
find a God Spirit Blood-Pulse.” After saying that, Bald Guy started
to dig. He did not plan on scoping out any other land pulses.</p>
<p>Han Sen and Li Bing Yu helped out. On the mountain, the terrain
was rocky everywhere. Below the plum tree, there was only soil. It
was much easier to dig there.</p>
<p>Han Seen only dug a little bit. The soil was harder than steel.
It was loose, but it was still difficult to dig up a lot of soil at
once.</p>
<p>Han Sen put a sprinkle of the soil into his hands to examine it.
He discovered that the soil had white dots on it. They were
metallic. They looked like metal from a mine.</p>
<p>They eventually dug nine feet deep when they found something
hard. They brushed away the soil around it. They found a root that
looked like a sea dragon.</p>
<p>The root was as black as ink. It was as if there were scales on
it. It looked extremely weird. Upon closer inspection, one thought
it looked like a dried snake.</p>
<p>The three of them kept digging around the root. Bald Guy kept
digging and said, “Be careful. I am unfamiliar with the situation
here. Do not dig too deep. It will not be good if you end up
digging into an evil spirit spring.”</p>
<p>More and more roots were dug up. Han Sen and the others noticed
there were more roots than there were branches on the plum tree.
The roots were like many dragons all tangled up into each other.
They were all over the place. They covered an area of at least 30
feet. They were much wider than the tree branches too.</p>
<p>Han Sen and the others had to widen their region of digging.
They ended up digging 90 feet away before reaching the end of the
roots.</p>
<p>They followed the roots and kept digging down. Lots of tree
roots were layered on top of each other like a lattice fence
outside a house. Bald Guy was hastily digging into it. He used his
shovel to dig into a tree root that was only the size of a finger,
but he did not even leave a white scrape on it. “It’s a very hard
tree root.” Bald Guy was shocked. His body combined with a very
powerful king-class gene race. The shovel was very unique as well.
Despite trying like that, no marks were left on the tree’s
roots.</p>
<p>Han Sen’s curiosity had been completely snagged. As he kept
digging, he said, “This plum tree is so weird. Whatever is down
there must be unique. We should keep digging.”</p>
<p>The three of them were digging for half the day before they
reached a depth of about 90 feet. One of the plum tree’s three
roots was visible. From what they saw, the big beard of roots
looked slightly like a ball. It covered the entire area and did not
allow the wind to affect</p>
<p>Bald Guy put down his shovel and wiped the sweat from his brow
as he said, “Stop digging. I do not think there is anything down
further. The good stuff is inside the roots of the tree.”</p>
<p>The metal, ore-like soil was too hard to dig. Although he had
the power to combine with a gene race, it was still very tiring for
him to dig for so long</p>
<p>Han Sen and Li Bing Yu agreed with Bald Guy’s assessment. They
had dug a hole that was 90 feet deep. If the gene egg was deep
inside, some weird scene should have been playing by now. Nothing
of the sort was going on. There was an 80 to 90% chance that
nothing more would happen if they went deeper. If there was
something good to retrieve, it had to be lurking within the
roots.</p>
<p>The plum tree’s roots did not grow normally. They crossed each
other to form a wall. It was as if they were all protecting
something.</p>
<p>Bald Guy used his shovel to dig around. He could not leave a
mark on the roots, so he looked to Han Sen, “Old Han, are you able
to break any of these roots to see what lies inside?”</p>
<p>“Ghost Kill, you give it a go,” Han Sen said to Li Bing Yu.</p>
<p>Li Bing Yu did not object. After all, she was as interested in
the plum tree as the others. Her body generated a flame and cat
ears. Her back sprouted a cat tail. Her fingernails extended like
five lethal blades. They were burning with flames.</p>
<p>“I have an adult god-class fire god claw cat,” Li Bing Yu said.
“Its fire element is very effective against creatures that are a
wood element. Perhaps it will work.” She then put her claws into
the tree roots.</p>
<p>Her nails displayed some fire blades. She slashed the tree
roots. Sparks flew everywhere, but the tree roots weren’t cut off.
They also did not burn. Li Bing Yu’s hands shook. The flames on the
nails were shaking. It looked like she had been shaken a lot.</p>
<p>“It’s very hard.” Li Bing Yu frowned. She really wanted to
summon her strongest gene race to test it, but that would expose
who she truly was. So, she denied that thought.</p>
<p>Han Sen used his hands to touch where Li Bing Yu slashed. Three
light marks had been created on the surface, but they were still
quite difficult to make out. The fire god claw cat’s power was
effective, but not by much. Without hesitation, Han Sen spread his
giant, gold peacock wings. The gold god light wings flickered. It
made the gold wings become a set of extremely sharp blades.</p>
<p>Katcha!</p>
<p>Cracking sounds penetrated their ears. Bald Guy was very happy.
He looked at the tree roots. He saw a dozen roots had been cut half
a foot, but they were not completely severed yet.</p>
<p>Han Sen was shocked. Li Bing Yu and Bald Guy might not have
known, but he did. Along with his power, the mutant ultimate-mode
god-class gene race could only cut half a foot deep. The tree roots
were scarily strong. But if he was able to damage the tree roots,
it was only a matter of time before he cut his way deeper. Han Sen
kept using the gold god wings. The peacock’s wings continuously
flashed. The gold light was flashing everywhere as he kept slicing
the tree’s roots.</p>
<p>After a few times of doing that, many of the tree roots had been
cut off. It revealed the shadow on the inside. Looking in from the
hole he had made, the tree roots were wrapped around ice. It gave
them all an instant chill.</p>
<p>The three of them looked at the ice. There was a white-clothed
woman frozen within the ice. The white-clothed woman sat inside the
ice without moving. She did not look dead. It looked more like she
was asleep.</p>
<p>Han Sen was shocked, but he was not shocked about there being a
woman inside the ice. He was shocked about the presence the ice
released.</p>
<p>“Jadeskin… No, it is the Cold Sutra.” Han Sen thought this was
weird. When he touched the ice, he almost screamed aloud.</p>
