<h2>Deified Fight</h2>
<h3>Chapter 2285</h3>

<p>“That guy seemed very spirited… What would make him run away in
such a hurry?” Han Sen looked at Yisha with confusion.</p>
<p>Yisha sighed and said, “Maybe its power takes a long time to
regenerate. That strike he unleashed might have cost him most of
the power he had gathered.”</p>
<p>Now Han Sen was able to understand. It was like the Red Mist
King that depended on the seven red mist minks for energy. It took
a very long time for such power to be gathered.</p>
<p>If Big King Bell had failed to bluff Han Sen and Yisha, it knew
it had to run once Fox Queen showed up.</p>
<p>“What do we do now, then?” Han Sen asked, looking at Yisha.</p>
<p>Yisha didn’t answer. She teleported to the backdoor.</p>
<p>Han Sen knew what she meant by that. He mounted the blood kirin
and followed after Yisha.</p>
<p>Big King Bell was a big phony, but he was familiar with the
surrounding area. Getting information from him could be quite
useful.</p>
<p>After they rushed out of the white whale, Yisha’s body flashed
away. The blood kirin was unable to catch up with her. It was like
a human having a foot race against a sports car.</p>
<p>“Half-deified” had the word “deified” in it, but they were still
King class beings at their core. Real deified beings were in
another league entirely.</p>
<p>“Han Sen!” Yisha had chased after Big King Bell, quickly
disappearing. Upon seeing Han Sen emerge from the white whale’s
belly, Fox Queen called out in surprise.</p>
<p>Before Han Sen could think of escaping, Fox Queen flashed before
him and the blood kirin to block their path.</p>
<p>“Good timing! Give me the relic, and I will spare your lives.”
Fox Queen narrowed her eyes at Han Sen, but it looked as if she was
smiling.</p>
<p>“Pretty Sister, you are giving me more trouble. I don’t have the
relic on me.” Han Sen looked troubled, and he said, “Did you see
that person that just ran off? That was my master, Knife Queen. I
gave her the relic.”</p>
<p>“In that case, let us see if your master or the relic is the
most important thing in your heart,” Fox Queen said coolly. Many
cords of power slid out of her, and they came slithering over to
wrap around Han Sen and the blood kirin.</p>
<p>But Han Sen patted his bird’s nest, which grew bigger to shield
him and the blood kirin. It blocked out Fox Queen’s cords of
power.</p>
<p>Even so, the cords of power locked tightly around the bird’s
best. And that meant Han Sen was now unable to escape.</p>
<p>“My good little brother, you think having this bird’s nest will
keep me from doing anything to you?” Fox Queen smiled, and then she
pulled something out from her waist.</p>
<p>Han Sen saw the item, and when he did, his heart fell.</p>
<p>Fox Queen had brought out a small jade flute. It was less than
one foot long, and it was a translucent, creamy color. It looked
very small and fragile.</p>
<p>“Fox Queen, are you proficient in sonic powers? The bird’s nest
might not be able to filter out noise, so I don’t know if it can
withstand sonic powers,” Han Sen thought to himself.</p>
<p>The bird’s nest was not a bai sema, and Han Sen couldn’t trigger
its full power. He used the bird’s nest’s power as a protective
force, but it was difficult to tell if he could block a sonic
attack.</p>
<p>Fox Queen brought the small jade flute to her lips. She smiled
at Han Sen, and then, she opened those red lips. The jade flute
began to produce sweet music.</p>
<p>The flute wasn’t particularly loud, but a very vague cord of
power came out of the flute. The cord was coming for the bird’s
nest.</p>
<p>Han Sen was shocked. He realized that the music of the flute
could seep through the dry grass of the bird’s nest, and that
realization made him depressed.</p>
<p>He had received the approval of the Undying Bird’s Nest, and so
he was able to make use of the bird’s nest. But that usage was
limited. Since he couldn’t activate the bird’s nest’s power, he
couldn’t utilize its defensive properties.</p>
<p>Fox Queen’s flute sounds were able to sink into Han Sen’s bird’s
nest, and there was nothing he could do to prevent it.</p>
<p>That music of the flute sank into the bird’s nest like silk
strands coming to tangle up Han Sen and the blood kirin. Han Sen
and the blood kirin did their best to free themselves, but they
were ultimately unable to get rid of the flute’s music.</p>
<p>Under the influence of the flute, Han Sen couldn’t control
himself. He lifted the bird’s nest and began crawling out like a
puppet on strings.</p>
<p>“Oh no! Oh no!” Han Sen felt terrible.</p>
<p>Seeing Han Sen slowly moving out of the bird’s nest, Fox Queen’s
expression was beatific. But when Han Sen saw the smile, he did not
feel good.</p>
<p>Just as Han Sen was pulled fully from the bird’s nest, Fox
Queen’s expression became surprised. She waved her jade flute.</p>
<p>Dong!</p>
<p>A purple knife air roared through the air. It was like a demon
coming forward to strike Fox Queen’s jade flute. That endless
purple knife air slashed the jade flute repeatedly, then struck Fox
Queen’s body and sent her flying ten kilometers away. Fox Queen
broke the knife air and stood still.</p>
<p>Yisha’s body flashed next to Han Sen, and her phoenix eyes moved
to meet Fox Queen’s beautiful eyes.</p>
<p>Fox Queen felt as if she could feel the spark between them.</p>
<p>“You are Han Sen’s teacher?” Fox Queen smiled like a flower, but
her eyes looked cold.</p>
<p>“Not bad,” Yisha answered coldly.</p>
<p>“Perfect. Han Sen said you possess the relic. Give it to me now,
and I will let you both walk free,” Fox Queen said coldly.</p>
<p>Yisha responded seriously, “I do not recall having a queen like
you to obey.”</p>
<p>Upon hearing those words, Fox Queen looked furious. She swung
her jade flute, and some sad sounds came at Yisha. As this
occurred, she hissed, “How dare you!”</p>
<p>Han Sen knew something very bad was about to happen. He didn’t
say anything and just maintained his hold on the bird’s nest,
moving toward the fallen white whale.</p>
<p>Two deified beings were now having a fight. Ordinary creatures
would not be able to endure the shockwaves. Han Sen didn’t want to
stay there and be reduced to dust.</p>
<p>Fortunately, the white whale was ownerless now that Big King
Bell had departed. Han Sen planned to hide inside and see if he
could operate the thing.</p>
<p>The white whale could block the attacks of a deified elite.
Yisha and Fox Queen had been unable to destroy its body. That thing
must have been very tough, so if Han Sen was able to drive it, the
whale would be far greater than a top-class battleship.</p>
<p>When Fox Queen came for Han Sen, she had given up trying to bind
the white whale. The white whale had fallen into the sea, and half
of it was just floating atop the surface of the sea.</p>
<p>The blood kirin dove and took them into the water. Han Sen
planned on going to the backdoor and making his way to the white
whale’s control room.</p>
<p>As soon as he entered, he noticed that Crime and Mister White
had followed him.</p>
