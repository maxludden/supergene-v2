<h2>One Arrow Shocks Ten Thousand Races</h2>
<h3>Chapter 2555</h3>

<p>Han Sen drew Wind String, and the predatory roar coming from the
bow grew ever louder. Nearby Kings felt their hearts pounding in
their chests. They felt as if their hearts were going to
explode.</p>
<p>As everyone drowned in this shock, they knew they had to leave
the area and watch Han Sen from a greater distance.</p>
<p>Autumn Wind started to look grim. Sweat trickled down his
forehead. Han Sen was going to pull the bowstring back as far as
possible. If he fired it now, Autumn Wind was genuinely unsure
whether or not he could dodge the arrow.</p>
<p>Wind String, at full strength, could harm a deified. Autumn Wind
was only half-deified. Even though it was his bow, he didn’t think
he could avoid an arrow fired by it.</p>
<p>Kat!</p>
<p>When Wind String’s bowstring reached the halfway point, Han Sen
felt as if something had gotten stuck. He couldn’t pull the string
further or let it go. As this occurred, a tornado-like substance
chain was released by the bow. It became a scary space tornado that
pulled Han Sen into it.</p>
<p>“Oh, no! Oh, no! Wind String is going to consume him.”</p>
<p>“Bad luck for Han Sen. Why did he have to borrow that cursed
Wind String?”</p>
<p>“Will Wind String cut off Han Sen’s head?”</p>
<p>“It is hard to say. Many people have been decapitated by Wind
String.”</p>
<p>Sweat ran down Autumn Wind’s forehead. If Han Sen fired that
arrow, he didn’t think he could dodge it.</p>
<p>As all the Kings discussed this, the tornado surrounding Wind
String suddenly disappeared. And Han Sen was still at the center of
the storm. He was holding the bow, with its bowstring moving again
as he drew it further back. He hadn’t been hurt by Wind String.</p>
<p>Wind String kept groaning in his hands. It looked as if it
didn’t want to be there, but it had no choice but to submit to its
new wielder. And as a result, it groaned.</p>
<p>“When I, Han Sen, want to fire an arrow, you have to open up no
matter what,” Han Sen proclaimed. Then he applied a massive amount
of strength from his fingers. The bowstring that wasn’t fully drawn
was suddenly pulled all the way. It was now as far as it could go.
It looked like a full moon.</p>
<p>Wind String shivered and shook, releasing an angry roar. But its
protests did nothing. It couldn’t stop Han Sen from firing an
arrow.</p>
<p>Everyone was shocked. Han Sen was using Wind String by force.
Even its powers of consumption didn’t prevent its new wielder from
using it. Seeing Wind String now was like watching a woman with a
man forcing himself on top of her.</p>
<p>Han Sen trained an arrow on Autumn Wind. Autumn Wind’s face went
grey. The sweat pouring from him had started to soak his
clothes.</p>
<p>Seeing that Han Sen on the cusp of firing an arrow, Autumn Wind
finally shouted, “No! Don’t shoot! I know that you can.”</p>
<p>Han Sen ignored his plight. It had been so hard to pull the
string of that bow; after all that work, he was definitely going to
fire it.</p>
<p>Whoosh!</p>
<p>When Han Sen released the bowstring, it broke the fabric of
space. The arrow flew out, disappearing from everyone’s vision.</p>
<p>Autumn Wind became a typhoon. He kept shifting position like a
wind that no one could catch.</p>
<p>But somehow, that feather arrow still appeared in front of him.
It was going to shoot right through his forehead. Autumn Wind was a
dead man.</p>
<p>Just as the feather arrow was about to puncture Autumn Wind’s
forehead, the arrow suddenly abandoned its target. It shot away
from everyone, heading toward a nearby planet instead.</p>
<p>Pang!</p>
<p>The arrow perforated the entire planet, and a second later, the
planet exploded. The shockwave washed over several other planets,
and the Kings around them were knocked off-balance by the
shockwaves.</p>
<p>Fortunately, they were far away from the planet. Otherwise, the
explosion would have hurt them a lot.</p>
<p>Autumn Wind’s face looked pale. If that arrow had hit him, his
body would have been annihilated. He would have been unable to
escape.</p>
<p>Even when he used Wind String, he couldn’t summon that much
power from the bow. After all, he wasn’t deified. He couldn’t use
the full potential of Wind String.</p>
<p>“Thank you for not killing me, Mr. Han.” Autumn Wind bowed to
Han Sen.</p>
<p>“Do I need to demonstrate with another arrow?” Han Sen asked,
looking at Autumn Wind.</p>
<p>“There is no need. I lost. I will keep my promise and pull the
rickshaw on your behalf. It will be an honor to do this,” Autumn
Wind said.</p>
<p>Han Sen returned Wind String and its quiver to Autumn Wind. The
bow’s master was Autumn Wind. Han Sen could use it, but he needed
the soul robe, Jadeskin, and the power of the Dongxuan Sutra to do
so. Firing that one arrow had tired him out more than an entire
fight could. No matter how good the bow was, it wouldn’t be easy
for Han Sen to use.</p>
<p>Plus, Han Sen had only said that he wanted to borrow it. He
always planned to return it.</p>
<p>Autumn Wind accepted the bow and returned it to his back. He
walked in front of the bronze rickshaw and stood next to Ji Yang
Sheng. He pulled the rope and said, “Mr. Ji, now that we are
coworkers, it is nice to meet you.”</p>
<p>“F*ck that. Look after your own *ss,” Ji Yang Sheng hissed
furiously. He was thinking about why elites like themselves had to
operate a rickshaw. And he wondered why Autumn Wind showed so much
enthusiasm for the lowly task.</p>
<p>When people saw Ji Yang Sheng and Autumn Wind pulling the bronze
rickshaw, they finally shook off their daze.</p>
<p>“God’s Daddy really deserves his title. He is too much of a
f*cking god. How could he force Wind String to submit to him
without ending up dead? Is he really a King? Are you sure he isn’t
a deified in disguise?”</p>
<p>“Nonsense! Deifieds can’t enter the core area.”</p>
<p>“Yeah, right. But when he used the bow, I think he generated a
substance chain.”</p>
<p>“That feather robe must be a powerful deified treasure. That has
to be how he was granted such a scary amount of power.”</p>
<p>“No wonder the Extreme King can’t capture him. He is way too
strong.”</p>
<p>There were some Extreme King princes and princesses there, but
none of them opted to attack Han Sen. No one was willing to try to
stop him. His performance with Wind String was so scary that it had
stunned everyone.</p>
<p>In the core area, not even the Extreme King wanted to confront
him. Unless they could bring deifieds to bear against him, Han
Sen’s power was simply overwhelming.</p>
<p>All the races researched the video of Han Sen firing his arrow.
The widely-accepted explanation was that the feather robe was a
mysterious treasure that helped him. It could some allow Han Sen’s
power to rival a deified.</p>
<p>“That *sshole! How does he have so much good luck? First, he
earned the Shield of the Medusa’s Gaze, and now he has that
mysterious feather robe. How many treasures does he have?” The
Sixth Uncle of the Extreme King saw the footage and moaned.</p>
<p>“It looks like we cannot capture him in the core area. We must
find him in the systems of chaos,” the Fourth Uncle Meng Lie said
in a hard voice.</p>
<p>“Spring Rain has been looking for him. I hope they will return
bearing results.” The Sixth Uncle didn’t harbor much hope for
Spring Rain’s success, though.</p>
<p>All the races now understood one thing: Han Sen shouldn’t be
provoked in the core area.</p>
