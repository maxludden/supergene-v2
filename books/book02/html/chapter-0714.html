    <p>
      The Light Son of God was firing on all cylinders, trying to catch Han Sen
      with his beams, but he couldn&#8217;t. No matter how fast he fired, Han
      Sen seemed able to predict his every move, resulting in a miss every time.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen knew this was his opportunity. He knew he could keep dodging the
      Light Son of God&#8217;s attacks, and all he would have to do was touch
      him to claim victory.
    </p>

    <p>
      The Light Son of God was ridiculously fast, and it was clear that the
      spirit&#8217;s primary trait was indeed speed. But this came at the cost
      of physical toughness; if the spirit was this quick, it wouldn&#8217;t
      have the defense of a super creature.
    </p>

    <p>
      He only wore a robe instead of armor, as well. This clue suggested that
      the spirit did not depend on vitality.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;I just need to hit him. If I do that, I&#8217;ll have a chance. I
      am only one step away from the Son of God&#8217;s reward! I have to risk
      it, no matter what. What if I am given a super beast soul, or even a super
      spirit?!&#8221; Han Sen gritted his teeth, dodging in a way to position
      the Light Son of God exactly where he wanted him to be.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;He can actually dodge the Light Son of God&#8217;s attacks like
      that? This is amazing! But still, dodging alone cannot secure victory. His
      attacks are too slow; he might not be able to hit the Light Son of
      God.&#8221; Hua Ping was full of both excitement and worry.
    </p>

    <p>
      He had watched many Second God&#8217;s Sanctuary Divinity&#8217;s Bouts
      over the years, and Dollar was the only evolver to come this far. He
      really hoped Dollar could win, and thus claim the Light Son of God&#8217;s
      position.
    </p>

    <p>
      But there was still a gulf of power separating the two. Even though Dollar
      could utilize his magic dodging moves to avoid the Light Son of
      God&#8217;s attacks, the speed of Dollar&#8217;s enemy kept them distanced
      from each other. He would most likely not be able to touch the Light Son
      of God, and that was enough for the spirit to maintain his throne.
    </p>

    <p>
      Everyone knew Dollar had opened his gene lock to fight, which meant his
      time was limited.
    </p>

    <p>
      Ordinary evolvers, in a fight this long, would already have exhausted
      their strength and had their gene lock shut down.
    </p>

    <p>
      Dollar was abnormal, it would seem. His fitness was much higher than the
      average evolver, and it seemed as if he could last far longer with an
      active gene lock.
    </p>

    <p>But it was not infinite, and no one knew exactly when it might fail.</p>

    <p>
      In fact, Han Sen&#8217;s ability to hold on this long was not solely down
      to his fitness; it was because he had Long Live and Jade-Sun Force. Energy
      replenished constantly, giving him what he needed to hold on.
    </p>

    <p>
      But Han Sen was still bound by his evolver status, and while he could
      indeed last a long time, he could not last forever. He would still have to
      beat the Light Son of God, sooner rather than later.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen&#8217;s eyes were so calm, and his body was so composed. Slowly,
      bit-by-bit, he was threading the subtle movements to lead the Light Son of
      God into exactly the right position.
    </p>

    <p>
      The Light Son of God, by this point, was madly attacking Han Sen like a
      rabid laser-dog. He hadn&#8217;t noticed up until now that he had been
      driven to the edge of the arena.
    </p>

    <p>
      The moment the Light Son of God backed into a corner, Han Sen made his
      move. Although he wasn&#8217;t as fast as the Light Son of God, he was
      quick enough that others could not even see his body.
    </p>

    <p>
      Even the spirit himself was spooked and taken off-guard by the sudden
      burst of speed from his opponent. He did not expect Han Sen to possess a
      speed like that, and he had unwittingly let him get close.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen&#8217;s eyes burst into flames. His heart pounded like a hammer,
      as his bones and flesh vibrated. A white light coursed through his body to
      give him greater speed.
    </p>

    <p>
      He simulated the Light Son of God&#8217;s own energy flow. His fitness
      prohibited him from being as powerful as the Light Son of God himself, but
      it was still effective. And this was a move that went beyond the
      audience&#8217;s wildest expectations.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen&#8217;s fitness was two hundred seventeen. The fitness of a super
      creature was around three hundred. The difference between them was 30%, so
      there was no chance the spirit could utterly, completely dominate Han Sen.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;How can he be that fast?&#8221; Many people stood up in reaction to
      Han Sen&#8217;s sudden, blazingly quick attack.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;With a speed like that, maybe he can&#8230;&#8221; Fang
      Mingquan&#8217;s excitement was through the roof.
    </p>

    <p>
      Hua Ping clenched his fist and stared at Han Sen&#8217;s next move with
      unblinking eyes. If this speed did not allow Han Sen to close the gap and
      touch the Light Son of God, there wouldn&#8217;t be another chance.
    </p>

    <p>
      A lot of people held their hands, in the hope that Han Sen could now hit
      his fearsome foe.
    </p>

    <p>
      The Light Son of God was already on the corner of the battleground, and he
      had been spooked by Han Sen&#8217;s sudden change of pace. When he
      realized what was going on, he quickly dodged Han Sen&#8217;s attack and
      went right past him. He managed to slip away from the corner.
    </p>

    <p>
      The audience could not help but sigh. They felt sorry for Dollar because,
      after all that, the Light Son of God had still managed to dodge the attack
      that had so much build up. His enemy was still too fast.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;If you want to compete with my speed, you have a long way to
      go,&#8221; the Light Son of God said with a mocking smile and disdainful
      look, as he passed Han Sen by.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;I do?&#8221; Han Sen stood where he was and coldly looked at the
      Light Son of God who had gone right past him. He opened his hands and
      tried to grab the Light Son of God.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;It is useless to compete with my speed; nothing in the Second
      God&#8217;s Sanctuary rivals me. You pitiful humans will never be able to
      achieve the same.&#8221; The Light Son of God sped up again and created a
      gap between him and Han Sen once more. Han Sen&#8217;s hand had not been
      able to even touch his clothes.
    </p>

    <p>
      Seeing Han Sen&#8217;s hands trying to grab him, the Light Son of God
      simply pulled away even further. The people who were watching were
      starting to once again feel weak and without hope.
    </p>

    <p>
      But then suddenly, the Light Son of God, who was quite far from Han Sen,
      had his whole body sucked towards Han Sen like a magnet. He was thrown
      through the air towards his human nemesis upside-down. When the gap
      closed, Han Sen grabbed his head.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Let&#8217;s try that again.&#8221; Han Sen raised his fist and
      brought a punch down directly on the Light Son of God&#8217;s
      suddenly-distraught face.
    </p>

    <p>Pang!</p>

    <p>
      The Light Son of God&#8217;s head suffered a terrible strike, which sent
      it backward. A large red mark painted the center of his pretty face, and
      his nose had been bent out of shape as it now oozed blood.
    </p>

    <p>
      After that heavy attack, the Light Son of God&#8217;s body did not slip
      away as he intended it to. He was sucked back into Han Sen&#8217;s hand.
    </p>

    <p>
      Without hesitation, Han Sen struck again, his fist unleashing the
      Elephant-Disc Punch upon his foe&#8217;s face multiple times. Punch after
      punch it raged, the skull of his enemy clanging like metal.
    </p>

    <p>
      Every punch was strong, and even the bones inside rattled and collided
      against themselves.
    </p>

    <p>
      The Light Son of God was in total shock. He tried to squirm his way free,
      to resist and fall back, but he couldn&#8217;t. Some strange force drew
      his body towards Han Sen; one he couldn&#8217;t escape. His speed had
      slowed down, and in this frenetic panic Han Sen had managed to catch up.
    </p>

    <p>Pang! Pang!</p>

    <p>
      The infernal fists crashed down on the Light Son of God&#8217;s face like
      a landslide. The sound of each punch was an audible pleasure. The
      boisterous Light Son of God was like anybody else now, with a bruised face
      and bleeding nose.
    </p>

    <p>
      The Light Son of God wanted to block the hits that kept pummeling him, but
      the force continuously sapped him of his speed. His moves were still being
      predicted, and Han Sen reacted accordingly every time. Han Sen punched him
      every time he made half a move. Being unable to dodge, all he could do was
      flail his hopeless hands.
