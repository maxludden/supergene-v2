  “Everything in this world has a uniqueness to its totality. The universe is a whole creation. A small creature’s body can be viewed as something complete. From their substances, a universe and the creatures that occupy it are whole in this world. That means the bodies themselves can be unique universes.” When Crape Myrtle spoke, his fingers moved. All of his fingers struck every part of Han Sen’s body.

Every finger that touched Han Sen was like a steel nail being hammered into his body. Han Sen felt the pain too unbearable to endure. He felt terrible.

The strangest thing about it all was the fact Han Sen’s clothes did not tear. His body wasn’t physically harmed either. Even so, Han Sen felt the sharp power of a nail perforating his body in mid-air. Even with the strength of his body, he could not get rid of the power’s restrictions.

“I practiced all my life, evolving and understanding the miracle that is this universe. Although I do not understand the miracle this is this universe, I did get a peek behind the veil. The power of this universe is indestructible. Even a sky full of God Spirits cannot keep it at bay. It does not matter how strong your body is because you cannot fight against it.” While Crape Myrtle was talking, he touched Han Sen 28 times with his fingers.

Where the 28 fingers pointed, a point of light flickered. It was like 28 stars were pinned to Han Sen’s body. They trapped Han Sen in space. That was especially true of the starlight on his forehead. The starlight on his forehead was so bright that he looked like an aurora borealis.

“How is it? Do you think I have what it takes to break your body?” After Crape Myrtle pulled his hand back, he looked at Han Sen, who was pinned in the air. He smiled at him.

In the beginning, Han Sen was able to move. Now, after 28 lights pinned his body, he was unable to. His power had been exhausted. It was like 28 nails had hammered him to a cross.

Han Sen was even more depressed about the fact that his body had not yet been activated. It was like the power that hurt his body did not exist.

Upon seeing Han Sen not answering, Crape Myrtle laughed. “What? Are you still not willing to concede? Do you really want me to kick you out of the 33 skies?”

Han Sen’s eyes looked at Crape Myrtle as if his eyes were on fire. He seriously said, “I just want to know if this is all the power you wield.”

“So, what? Even if it is all my power, so what?” Crape Myrtle looked at Han Sen with interest.

“Nothing. I just wanted to thank you for telling me the theory of the universe,” Han Sen said.

Crape Myrtle laughed. “There is no need to thank me. I did not become the universe itself, and what I said may not even hold true. Even if I believe my words to be the truth, I have not yet been able to take that step. Perhaps what I think is right may turn out to be wrong. If you listen to my words and follow them, and they are revealed to be wrong, you might end up even more astray. Perhaps you will want to scold me later.”

Han Sen behaved as if he did not hear what Crape Myrtle said. He asked, “Is this the last step? If I can feel the universe inside my body, does that mean I have walked that step?”

“Maybe,” Crape Myrtle said. “Judging from your body, it is a shame that you may never be able to take that step. That is because other people’s bodies have rules and orders whereas yours is just a mess. I am afraid you will not become a universe.”

Han Sen had to admit that what Crape Myrtle said made sense. In the past, he leveled up. His power was very similar to the rules of the universe.

Now, his body had no rules or order. How could he continue with a body like the one he had?

Han Sen thought, “If Crape Myrtle is the guy from the geno hall, then he is one of the very few guys that are so close to that step. The way he talks about becoming a universe must be that step Qin Xiu has been looking for. But he is right. With the current condition of my body, I do not think I will be able to walk that step.”

Crape Myrtle looked like he was smiling at Han Sen, but he was not smiling. “Are you disappointed in the prospect you will never be able to walk that step?”

“There is nothing to be disappointed about,” Han Sen said. “Life is just like that. No one will ever know what they will become. I have walked down many different paths and enjoyed many great vistas to see what others see. To me, they are the most precious forms of wealth I hold.”

Crape Myrtle looked at him with disdain. He laughed and said, “What you have just told me sounds like a loser giving an interview and saying they have walked all they needed to and are happy with their current condition. It is like friendship comes first and competition comes second. It is like as long as your heart has me, you can marry anyone you like. They are the words of the meek wanting nothing more than to comfort their wailing hearts.”

When Han Sen heard him say all that, he laughed and said, “You are right. Those are the words of comfort spoken to themselves by losers.”

Crape Myrtle looked at Han Sen and asked, “Aren’t you doing the exact same? You are saying you are happy by merely seeing what there is to see and reaching the end does not truly matter. You are just comforting yourself.”

Han Sen seriously said, “All I said was the views I admire are my rewards. I did not say the end goal does not matter. To me, the end and the view are just as important. I want it to be exciting, and I want to reach the end I want.”

“It is a shame you have no chance of reaching the end,” Crape Myrtle coldly said.

Han Sen shook his head. “No. I just cannot go to the end that is established by someone else like you. It does not mean I cannot reach an ending established by myself.”

“Oh, then tell me, how do you seek to reach your end?” Crape Myrtle looked at Han Sen with interest. He did not proceed to do anything else.

Han Sen did not answer him. Instead, he said, “To become the universe is a very strong finish, but that is just the end you set up for yourself. How do you know there is still no higher finish even beyond that?”

“When the body becomes a universe, that means you burn yourself and commit yourself to the universe,” Crape Myrtle said. “You will be at the same level as the universe. That is the universe. That is all. You cannot become greater than that.”

“If the universe is the end, then what resides outside the universe?” Han Sen asked.

“That is whatever philosophy claims it to be,” Crape Myrtle said. “There are no definitive answers.”

“Let’s say there is another end outside of the universe. That means the end of the universe is just a stop. If you choose to walk to that stop, then I will choose a different path. Just because I do not go to that stop does not mean I will not reach the end.” “It is a shame that all of this is just a theory. You are facing are some actual difficulties. If you cannot fix your current technical limitations, you do not have what it takes to continue and go further.” Crape Myrtle looked at Han Sen as if his eyes were on fire.

“Maybe not.” Han Sen’s eyes started to look bright. A power inside his body was coming to a boil.

The 28 lights on Han Sen grew brighter and brighter. The force that pinned his body in the air was like nails keeping a prisoner upright.
