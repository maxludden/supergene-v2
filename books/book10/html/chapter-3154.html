<p>Qin Bai looked frightened. He kept stuttering, unsure of what to
say.</p>
<p>Han Sen said, “Mister Crown Prince has been practicing sword
skills here.”</p>
<p>“I am addressing the crown prince. Since when were you permitted
to talk to me?” Jia Shi Zhen looked into Han Sen’s eyes with
flickering rage.</p>
<p>The way Han Sen spoke was like he was lying without blinking. It
enabled Jia Shi Zhen to confirm that he was a dog without any
boundaries.</p>
<p>The match of chess was only halfway done. There was no time to
put it away. Thus, to still tell her Qin Bai was practicing sword
skills was ridiculous. No one would have believed his words, let
alone Jia Shi Zhen.</p>
<p>as</p>
<p>“Teacher, I really was practicing sword skills.” Jia Shi Zhen
did not believe him, so Qin Bai felt as if he was been wronged. He
had suffered so much there, but Jia Shi Zhen believed he had done
nothing but play around. He felt awfully wronged.</p>
<p>Seeing Qin Bai lie without blinking, Jia Shi Zhen’s frown
tightened.</p>
<p>In the past, Qin Bai had always been naughty, but that was fine
because he never lied and always admitted to what he had done.</p>
<p>Now, Qin Bai’s behavior had obviously worsened. It was likely
affected by Han Sen, who was a dog.</p>
<p>Jia Shi Zhen was not a dumb fool who had no brain. She did not
want to immediately expose Qin Bai. She coldly asked, “How did you
practice? Did you run into trouble?” Qin Bai wasn’t too sure. He
looked at Han Sen. He had been tortured for two days, yet he had
not held a sword once. He had not combined with the nine-wave fish
either. That did not really fill him with courage.</p>
<p>Han Sen nodded at him. To learn a sword skill, the most
important thing was understanding. Skills and other things were not
really important. Bai Qin had been tortured for two days by
Bao’er’s simulation of the Wavy Sword Mind. No matter how dumb he
was, he should have at least learned something. Qin Bai was not
actually dumb. He was just very playful.</p>
<p>Qin Bai still looked frightened and desperate for help. Han Sen
coughed and said, “The crown prince has only been practicing sword
skills for the past two days. He has not practiced combining with
the nine-wave fish. Why don’t you test the crown prince’s sword
skills first?”</p>
<p>Jia Shi Zhen did not stop Han Sen this time. She coldly laughed.
“This is ridiculous! If there was no combining with the nine-wave
fish, he could not feel the water element power and wave power.
Without those two feelings, the Wavy Sword Skill cannot work. What
in the world has he been practicing?”</p>
<p>The skills of the universe of kingdoms had to be used when
combined with a gene race. Otherwise, a skill was just an empty
shell. Jia Shi Zhen was not inclined to hear Han Sen’s
nonsense.</p>
<p>She did not object. She told Qin Bai, “If you have practiced a
sword skill, then show me how you practiced it.”</p>
<p>Qin Bai’s heart did not really have any power in it. He looked
at Han Sen, but Han Sen just gave him a sword. He winked at Qin Bai
to make sure he could perform the Wavy Sword Skill.</p>
<p>Qin Bai gnashed his teeth. He accepted the sword and walked into
the field. He was going to perform Wavy Sword Skill.</p>
<p>Jia Shi Zhen did not say a word. She watched Qin Bai’s
performance. She was not going to be surprised if Qin Bai performed
it terribly. She wanted to use this as an opportunity to keep him
away from bad people and encourage staying in the company of good
people.</p>
<p>That was especially true of evil influencers like this dog, Han
Sen. It was best for everyone involved if they stopped staying in
contact with each other.</p>
<p>Jia Shi Zhen had even composed a speech and thought deeply about
how it could prove educational for Qin Bai.</p>
<p>Qin Bai was not hopeless when it came to sword skills. After
all, he had followed a few teachers for many years. He was not very
good, but he could use ordinary sword skills.</p>
<p>The Wavy Sword Skill was something he had not practiced much,
but he knew what it looked like.</p>
<p>He was now performing it. The skill was not done smoothly, so
everyone could tell that he had not spent time practicing it.</p>
<p>Jia Shi Zhen looked as if she had expected this result. She was
not surprised. She coldly looked at Han Sen. She saw that he was
behaving very chill. It was as if Qin Bai’s terrible performance
had nothing to do with him. She thought the guy had to be
incredibly shameless.</p>
<p>If the crown prince was not allowed to play freely, he could
have been spending the time practicing. On top of all this, it did
not appear that Han Sen felt guilty.</p>
<p>“People with an attitude like that must stop having contact with
the crown prince,” Jia Shi Zhen thought.</p>
<p>Seeing Qin Bai looking clumsily performing the Wavy Sword Skill,
Jia Shi Zhen could not bear to watch him much longer. If she did
not want Qin Bai to be embarrassed, she would have already stopped
him.</p>
<p>The formation of the sword skill Qin Bai performed a little
later started to surprise Jia Shi Zhen.</p>
<p>When he first started, Qin Bai was too nervous. He had no idea
what he was practicing and was freaking out. After trying it out a
few times, it was unknown why, but he had started to think about
the sword mind performed by Bao’er. It was the one that shocked the
sky.</p>
<p>It was like reading 300 poems from the Teng Era. Even if one did
not write them down, one could still remember them. Qin Bai could
not completely understand the will of the sword mind, but he had
been hurt by it. Now, he was performing it. It was kind of close.
The more he did it, the smoother it went.</p>
<p>Plus, Qin Bai was the sort of person to treat a dead horse as a
living horse. He just kept performing.</p>
<p>In the beginning, Jia Shi Zhen did not see the real thing. As
Qin Bai started to perform more, that changed. Although his sword
skills did not look experienced, within the sword skills, there
were elements of the sword mind of Wavy Sword Skill.</p>
<p>Jia Shi Zhen could not believe it. Things like sword wills were
very rare in the universe of kingdoms because it drew on power from
the outside. Not many people were able to practice like that, so
ordinary gene casters went for powers that combined. They did not
pay attention to the mind very much. Only some powerful elites
would turn their focus to the mind when they reached the zenith of
their body’s capabilities.</p>
<p>At Bai Qin’s age, he was not interested in studying. Even if he
was, there was no way he could learn the mind.</p>
<p>Now, Qin Bai’s sword skill featured the mind. Jia Shi Zhen was
shocked. She was unable to believe what she was witnessing.</p>
<p>Jia Shi Zhen had to double-check it more than a few times. She
eventually realized that she was correct. There was a sword mind at
work in Qin Bai’s sword skill. The wavy mind had to be correct.</p>
<p>Qin Bai kept displaying the sword skill and showing it to Jia
Shi Zhen. He was that Jia Shi Zhen looked surprised. He felt really
happy about it.</p>
<p>Jia Shi Zhen had trained him for a few years, but he had never
seen Jia Shi Zhen look like this. She used to be very mean to him.
She was always harsh and treated him like wood that could not be
carved.</p>
<p>This was the first time Jia Shi Zhen had looked at him this way.
His confidence was given a major boost. He felt as if he had just
eaten a life fruit. He felt as his body was surging with
energy.</p>
<p>Qin Bai was scared of Jia Shi Zhen. He was nervous, but the
nervousness seemed to suddenly vanish. His sword skills seemed
smoother. The Wavy Sword Skill’s mind was becoming more
prominent.</p>
<p>Jia Shi Zhen was becoming more shocked. She could not figure out
how Qin Bai’s sword skills had developed a sword mind.</p>
