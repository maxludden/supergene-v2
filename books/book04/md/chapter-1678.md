  “It’s over,” said Gu Qingcheng. After Han Sen and Ancient Devil got sucked into God’s Door, her face changed horrifically.

God’s Door was the path by which demigods could reach the Fifth Sanctuary. It was the path creatures took. The power inside would crush the person, rebuild their body, and rinse them clean.

It was built for the person that summoned the door. The rinsing and rebuilding would have to match with the element.

A person who had an attunement to a fire element would be washed and rebuilt with fire, once beyond God’s Door. Fire casters have the advantage that would allow them to finish the process and be rebuilt successfully.

If a water element person entered the fire element God’s Door, they would be rinsed and rebuilt with fire just the same. With a lack of proficiency with the element, though, they would not succeed. That was why Gu Qingcheng was in such shock, after seeing Han Sen get sucked inside.

No one knew what Ancient Devil’s element was, but whatever it was, it was complicated and extremely unique. It was very different from Han Sen. Since Han Sen had now been dragged inside, his chances of survival were low.

Normal demigods had a low success rate themselves. The ratio was something of a 1:1000 sort of figure. But Han Sen had stumbled into a door opened by someone else, which made the chances of survival even lower. And things were only made worse by the fact that the other person was a being as terrifying as Ancient Devil.

“Dad!” Seeing the door sucking Han Sen and Ancient Devil inside, Bao’er flew through the door just before it closed.

Boom!

The stone door closed tight, hidden in the air. Then, it was gone.

“Will the boss and Bao’er be okay?” Cheap Sheep asked, reeling from shock.

Gu Qingcheng did not answer. She pulled out Pure and leaped down towards the dying elders. The elders were all strong, but they had been brought to the brink of death by Ancient Devil. They wouldn’t be able to fight back.

Seeing Gu Qingcheng come, they were all terrified. They wished to run, but their bodies were in no shape to. That was because their strength and energy had been drained by Ancient Devil.

A sword came down, launching an elder’s head across the sky.

“If you kill me, the Yin will kill you!” Elder Yin shouted.

Gu Qingcheng did not care at that moment, and she cut Elder Yin in half.

Cheap Sheep and Green Cow came running out. They stepped on Elder Yin’s sundered corpse and proclaimed, “Bad idea to come and mess with Shadow Shelter, eh?”

“Let me step on it some more to avenge the misdeed done upon our boss!”

Pang!

An arrow came flying forward, piercing into another elder’s chest. Han Menger looked incredibly angry.

Han Menger then nocked another arrow and took aim at Sacred’s leader. Gu Qingcheng stopped her, though. Han Sen had told Gu Qingcheng all about Han Menger’s true identity, and Gu Qingcheng had made sure to look after her. She had to stop her from harming Sacred’s leader.

Sacred’s leader could be killed by anyone else, but not Han Menger.

Sacred’s leader managed to escape. Gu Qingcheng did not bother going after him, and she allowed his broken body to slither away.

Sacred’s leader had decomposed quickly, and there wouldn’t be much else he could do.

The important thing was that Gu Qingcheng had to leave a few alive. The sanctuary needed to know it was Ancient Devil’s work that had caused so much harm. The story had to spread. What had happened to the elders was not something done by Shadow Shelter.

They did not know if Han Sen was alive, however, and that meant the mirror could not currently be used. If a revenge attack came, they’d lose. They didn’t have the defense and security they did before.

Gu Qingcheng could only deal with a few elders, but she still had Red Pony and Han Menger for aid.

If you didn’t sound powerful and assert authority, people could easily bully you. And others might think they could bully Shadow Shelter without paying a price. If Shadow Shelter was turned into a scapegoat, there’d be much trouble in the times ahead.

The fight at Shadow Shelter shocked the entirety of the Fourth God’s Sanctuary, however, when news did spread.

All the tribes now despised Ancient Devil for the evil he was. And they were surprised to hear just how powerful Han Sen was, and how powerful Shadow Shelter had become. Most of the elites had been harmed by Ancient Devil in some way, and so no one dared bother Shadow Shelter anymore. That was because Gu Qingcheng and Death Goddess were too scary, and the elders slain by Gu Qingcheng did not respawn.

After the two battles, the structure of the Fourth God’s Sanctuary had changed. A time of peace arrived.

***

Han Sen and Ancient Devil had been sucked into God’s Door. Han Sen hadn’t counted on getting sucked in, as he thought the punch was something Ancient Devil would be unable to resist It was a one-hit kill sort of thing, he believed.

But the White Donkey had gladly given its life to accept that punch instead of its master, and that allowed Ancient Devil to open the door.

“I am surprised someone would be willing to sacrifice themselves for that abhorrent Ancient Devil.” Han Sen sighed.

But there was no time for Han Sen to feel anything right now. The moment he fell into the door, he felt as if he had fallen into a vat of oil. The cells in his body were fried, ravaging his skin.

All the feelings in the world were useless at that point. He had no vision, and not even his eighth sense. His body was rapidly decomposing.

Han Sen was in a weird mode. He felt as if his spirit and his body were now two separate entities. His body was decomposing, but something different was going on with his soul.

The power of God’s Door decomposed his flesh, bone, organs, and brain. All that was leftover was some gooey liquid inside. And Han Sen’s mind or soul was drifting amidst the molecules. The body disappeared, like it had nothing to do with him anymore.

Han Sen had only heard about a body being rebuilt, but he had never heard about the specifics.

Suddenly, Crystal Core, Real Blood, Dollar, and Bulwark Umbrella all flew out. They melted in the midst of those molecules, too.

The molecules surrounded the four geno cores, and Han Sen felt as if those geno cores were working to help rebuild his body.

At this time, the power of God’s Door changed. The decomposition power changed to one of construction. The power to rebuild a body fell on the geno cores and the molecules, but it caused damage to Han Sen’s molecules and geno cores.

The bad side about not matching elements had finally appeared.
