<p>“Sky Vine Radish’s god spirit? Are you the creature that killed
the god? Did you take Sky Vine Radish’s god spirit? I did not
expect that a lowlife creature could do that.” Evil Lotus God stood
up. He was still coughing up blood. His eyes were staring at Sky
Vine Radish, who stood before Han Sen. Clearly, he could see Sky
Vine Radish.</p>
<p>Second Uncle and the others were even more shocked. When the
god’s sadness happened, it made for a popular topic of
conversation. For it now to be revealed that it was a xenogeneic
that killed the god, it was pretty difficult to fathom.</p>
<p>Han Sen’s face still did not change. Sky Vine Radish’s god
spirit was still under his control. It had a scary green god light.
It was madly attacking Evil Lotus God, or rather, the evil lotus’s
purple, evil ghost spirit body.</p>
<p>It was different from Han Sen, who was using his mind control to
operate the god spirit. Evil Lotus God’s body seemed to exist
alongside the purple, evil ghost spirit body. Its movements
affected the purple, evil ghost spirit’s movements.</p>
<p>Han Sen was watching the fight from afar. Evil Lotus God had to
join the fight with all his might. If the purple, evil ghost spirit
was damaged, Evil Lotus God himself would be damaged too.</p>
<p>The purple, evil ghost spirit was fighting Sky Vine Radish like
mad. Its scary power was able to destroy everything, but this power
was too amazing. Aside from the purple, evil spirit, and Sky Vine
Radish, no other substance in that universe could be affected by
that power. Second Uncle and the others were not able to see the
god spirit.</p>
<p>From what they could tell, Han Sen was just floating in the air.
He was watching Evil Lotus God, and Evil Lotus God was an insane
lunatic flailing around in the air. He kept spitting out blood and
flying away.</p>
<p>“Who is Mister Holy Baby?” Londo mumbled. “He is so shockingly
powerful. He looks like more of a god than Evil Lotus God
does.”</p>
<p>“Maybe only the king knows where Holy Baby came from, and that
is why the king accepted him as a student. He can fight against the
gods. Only very rare true god class elites can do such a thing.”
Second Uncle looked at Han Sen, who was in the sky, with a complex
look.</p>
<p>Ger’s expression looked strange as he said, “Even Evil Lotus God
said Mister Holy Baby killed the god. Is that really true?”</p>
<p>No one had the answer. They all wanted to know the answer
too.</p>
<p>Although Han Sen was the aggressive one, Sky Vine Radish’s god
spirit power was not any stronger than Evil Lotus God’s god spirit.
Their powers were almost the same.</p>
<p>If Han Sen did not use the mistakes of Evil Lotus God and damage
Evil Lotus God’s purple, evil spirit in the beginning, he could not
suppress him now.</p>
<p>“A low race is a low race. Even if you have a god spirit, you
will only be used by others.” Evil Lotus God was suppressed, but he
still looked very prideful. His eyes were burning brighter than
ever. They even looked greedy. He looked at the Sky Vine Radish’s
god spirit with greed.</p>
<p>“It is enough to kill you.” Han Sen sensed that too. After Evil
Lotus God combined with the purple, evil spirit, it had more
agility. He directly used power more. It was not like he was using
his mind to control the purple, evil spirit. After all, it was
still not natural. Although he had the advantage, he could not beat
the purple, evil spirit.</p>
<p>In the fight, Han Sen was watching the purple, evil spirit, and
Evil Lotus God. He knew for sure that the purple, evil spirit was a
god spirit, but it was different from the Sky Vine Radish. Sky Vine
Radish’s green god light was obviously a plant power, and the
purple, evil spirit was of another element. Han Sen did not see
what the difference was.</p>
<p>I wonder if my body can be combined with the god spirit. Han Sen
was looking at Evil Lotus God, wanting to know how he could combine
with the god spirit to fight. He looked at him for a long time but
could not see anything.</p>
<p>Evil Lotus God suddenly and coldly said, “Ignorant lowlife
creature. Me, a God, will let you know what the true power of a god
spirit is.”</p>
<p>While he was talking, the purple, evil spirit suddenly had a
weird mark on its forehead. That mark was made of countless
universal rules. It was just a godly miracle, but it showed endless
miracles of the universe.</p>
<p>Han Sen suddenly felt bad. When that mark appeared, Han Sen
sensed that the purple, evil spirit body’s spirit power had
increased. It was like it had been buffed by the power of the
universe. It suddenly went through Sky Vine Radish and was wildly
increasing.</p>
<p>“By the name of Evil Lotus God, accept God’s punishment!” When
Evil Lotus God’s god voice sounded, the purple, evil spirit’s hands
clasped together to have him sit like a buddha. Beneath him was a
purple, evil lotus. When that evil lotus opened, Han Sen felt the
whole world was like a purple lotus flower that had opened. It was
like he had fallen into an endless lotus pool.</p>
<p>Han Sen looked at Second Uncle and the others. They had no
reaction. They were not able to see the purple lotus flower.</p>
<p>Han Sen had many questions to think over. He thought, It looks
like Sky Vine Radish and the evil lotus power are just like the
gods. They cannot affect other universal creatures, but why are
their bodies different from Empty God, Sky Armor God, and the
others? They can visit the universe and hurt the creatures of the
universe.</p>
<p>Evil Lotus God did not stop on the behalf of Han Sen’s pause.
Many purple lotus flowers opened. They exploded. The power blew up
Sky Vine Radish.</p>
<p>Evil Lotus God walked with the purple, evil spirit and the
purple lotus. It was madly attacking Sky Vine Radish.</p>
<p>The purple, evil spirit’s power was much better than Sky Vine
Radish, and it had the help of a purple lotus. Sky Vine Radish was
at a bad disadvantage. The purple evil spirit kept attacking. Soon,
the green light broke. A second later, an entire arm was
severed.</p>
<p>Han Sen was not injured because of that. He was different from
Evil Lotus God. Even if Sky Vine Radish was killed, it would not
affect him. Purple, evil spirit power did not affect his body.
However, if Sky Vine Radish was killed, Han Sen would have nothing
left to go against Evil Lotus God.</p>
<p>His eyes were like blades. Han Sen moved his body. He was going
into the battlefield. He knew that by depending on Sky Vine Radish,
the battle would be lost. He had to co-operate with Sky Vine Radish
if he wanted to defeat Evil Lotus God.</p>
<p>Han Sen moved. Evil Lotus God knew what he was going to do. He
looked disdained and said, “Ignorant lowlife creature. Do you think
a god body cannot hurt your body and you can ignore it? You are so
dumb.”</p>
<p>Evil Lotus God punched Sky Vine Radish and threw a punch at Han
Sen. The purple, evil spirit was doing the same thing and threw a
punch at Han Sen too.</p>
<p>Han Sen did not move. He threw out the suppressing plastic bag
and punched it to make it shatter. Lots of pottery powder came out
like a grey, dark mist.</p>
<p>“Holy Kirin is strong, but if you think the ash can hurt a god,
you are too naive.” Evil Lotus God continued with his punch. The
purple, evil spirit broke through the ash.</p>
