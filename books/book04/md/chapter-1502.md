  After Han Sen’s discussion with Sieg, he noticed something was wrong when he next tried to use his communicator to connect to Skynet. It came as an extreme shock.

While they only a single day had passed inside the Main Control Room, outside in the Alliance, ten years had gone by.

“It’s no wonder Sieg doesn’t recognize us.” Han Sen thought this fact was unbelievable. The crystallizer technology was also able to distort time. It was quite a frightening realization.

Han Sen took a look at The Story of Genes. He had initially found it difficult to believe it was a proper book you could learn to practice with. Now that he understood that the crystallizers were capable of playing with time, the possibilities the book suggested seemed a lot more convincing.

Han Sen planned to go home and practice with the techniques, and although his abilities were low for the book’s requirements, it wouldn’t do any harm to at least try out its teachings.

Han Sen rode Sieg’s ship to Mirror Planet. Han Sen was able to catch up on the news via Skynet, and learn what he had missed over the past ten years.

Many things had occurred. The Angel Gene Fluid had come a long way, as had many other types of medicines and formulas.

Many humans had become demigods over those ten years, as well. But in the Fourth God’s Sanctuary, humans were still very weak overall. Compared to spirits and creatures, humans were still nothing.

And the most important thing was that the shura had invented a geno fluid of sorts. With it, they could enter the sanctuary and not suffer damage for a period of time. They could move there freely.

They weren’t yet able to absorb geno points yet, though. And neither could they use beast souls or geno cores. Not every shura would enter via the First God’s Sanctuary, either.

According to the shura fighter’s rankings, first rank fighters would end up entering the First God’s Sanctuary. Their ranking number correlated with the sanctuary they would enter, one by one. Still, with all that being said, the shura weren’t gaining many advantages or boons from entering the sanctuaries just yet.

It was a development that affected humans, nonetheless, and fights had broken out between the shura and humans inside the sanctuaries.

When Sieg went away, Han Sen and Ji Yanran called their respective parents. When Luolan and Ji Ruozhen saw Han Sen and Ji Yanran, they started to cry. Even Ji Ruozhen’s eyes turned red, despite the fact that he rarely displayed emotion. He was exuberant to see that they had come back.

Ji Ruozhen was no longer the president. A few years prior, Angel Gene and Starry Group supported Wang Zhixuan to become president.

Han Sen knew who Wang Zhixuan was; he was Wang Mengmeng’s father and Wang Yuhang’s big brother.

Ji Ruozhen told Han Sen not to contact anyone else just yet or let the world know they weren’t dead. They should wait until they had returned home first.

Ji Ruozhen allowed them to stay with Sieg until they reached Mirror Planet. When they reached there, he would arrange passage for them to come home.

“Thanks, Sieg. You have our phone number now, and if there’s anything you need, feel free to give us a call.” When they reached Mirror Planet, they said their goodbyes and parted ways. They wished to pay Sieg a sum, but he kindly declined.

They saw an airship already waiting for them on the surface of Mirror Planet. It took Han Sen and his family all the way back to Planet Roca. Ji Ruozhen and Luolan were already there, waiting for them at home.

When Han Sen and Ji Yanran saw their parents, they didn’t feel anything. After all, for them, they had only been gone a few days.

But Ji Ruozhen, his wife, and Luolan felt a lot different. They came forward to greet them with much excitement.

Han Sen and Ji Yanran were still affected by their emotions, though, and they opened their arms for hugs.

“My baby, you are back! Grandma missed you. Why have you not yet grown?”

“Littleflower, why have you refused to grow? Will you start growing sometime in the future?”

Han Sen and Ji Yanran felt awkward, as most of their affection seemed directed towards Littleflower. They didn’t care much for Han Sen and Ji Yanran, and they ended up standing where they were with their arms frozen in mid-air having expected hugs of their own.

Once they were home, Han Sen and Ji Yanran explained everything to Ji Ruozhen. When their story was complete, the man frowned.

“Dad, do you know about the New Community?” Han Sen asked Ji Ruozhen.

Ji Ruozhen nodded and then shook his head. “Yes, I have heard about the New Community. They have only been active in the past few years. When incidents transpire, particularly those that involve humans and shura together, you can catch a glimpse of them. No one in the Ji family has yet been able to discover who the leader of the New Community is, though. We can’t even determine whether or not the leader is a shura or a human.”

“With the power they possess, they cannot lack strong backing,” Han Sen said.

“Ordinarily, organizations such as this cannot be so secretive, but the New Community is strange. Their ranks are composed of humans and shura. What’s more, some big families work for them. But not even they, through doing that, are able to uncover who the leader of the New Community is.”

Ji Ruozhen paused briefly, before going on to say, “You guys should lay low and let me investigate matters first.”

After talking business, Han Sen asked Luolan, “Mom, where is Little Yan?”

Luo Lan smiled. “Don’t worry, she has become a demigod and established a way to return to the Alliance. She is currently practicing back in the sanctuary, as we speak. We can’t contact her right now, but when she gets back, we’ll let her know. She’ll be delighted to see you’ve returned.”

That day had passed far too quickly, and he had learned even Little Yan had become a demigod. Ultimately, Han Sen let out a sigh.

For the next two days, he rested at home. When boredom finally hit, he decided to return to the sanctuary.

Luckily, Mask Shelter and Ling Mei’er were still doing fine. Moment Queen had helped bring Ling Mei’er’s geno core up to gemstone class in the time he had been gone. She was now allowed to visit Dark Spirit Shelter, and she had been there on a number of occasions.

Moment Queen had also obtained a gemstone geno core. But, she had very bad news to relay to Han Sen.

A woman approached Shadow Shelter many years ago, saying she was looking for him. But due to his absence, she claimed the shelter for herself. Now, the shelter belonged to that woman and still, to that day, she was waiting for Han Sen.

“Did she give you a name?” Han Sen asked.

“No. But she was a human; beautiful and strong,” Moment Queen said after a moment of thought.

“Gu Qingcheng? If that is her, she is coming after Elysian Moon. I wonder if Elysian Moon is still alive?” Han Sen then summoned the Elysian Umbrella. It was still under the control of Real Blood, and as a result, it was still colored red. The image of the green-clothed woman was atop it. She had yet to be refined.

Han Sen planned to go to Shadow Shelter. After all, the silver fox and the others were still there. If he didn’t go, there was the possibility they’d be held hostage.
