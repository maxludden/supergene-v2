<p>“I failed again?” Han Sen looked pale. His power buzzed feebly,
and his lifeforce was at a very low level.</p>
<p>Han Sen had cast all the Dongxuan Sutra power that he was able
to. He used all his energy trying to push the cogwheel and get it
moving, so he could open its area and ascend to King class. Getting
the cog moving should not have been this difficult.</p>
<p>Many Dukes that were weaker than Han Sen reached King class with
no trouble. Han Sen’s fitness and power let him fight most King
class elites, but when Han Sen cast his Dongxuan Sutra, his own
self-universe cogwheel would not move.</p>
<p>Han Sen thought about the potential reasons for why that might
be. The King area required its own universe cogwheel to spin within
the universal machine.</p>
<p>According to the theory, if he was powerful enough, he could
move his own cogwheel to shift all the cogwheels that were
connected.</p>
<p>Han Sen was powerful. He was likely the only one of his kind as
a Duke. So, his self-universe cogwheel was bigger than that of any
other Duke.</p>
<p>The other Dukes had self-universe cogwheels that might only
connect with one or two other cogwheels, but Han Sen’s
self-universe cogwheel might connect with hundreds or even
thousands of universal cogwheels. The more he was connected to, the
harder it was to get it moving.</p>
<p>Clearly, Han Sen’s power wasn’t enough to push all those cogs at
the same time. That was why it was so difficult for him to move up
to King class.</p>
<p>Han Sen decided to give up on his Dongxuan Sutra and bring his
Jadeskin up to King class instead, but he soon noticed that this
self-universe cogwheel was too strong, as well. It connected to too
many universal cogwheels. So, leveling up Jadeskin to King class
would be just as hard as ascending with the Dongxuan Sutra. The
scariest thing, however, was that the Dongxuan Sutra could see the
universal cogwheels. When Han Sen used Jadeskin instead, the
cogwheels seemed blurry and indistinct. He couldn’t really see
them, which actually made things harder.</p>
<p>“The Dongxuan Sutra. The Dongxuan Sutra has the highest chance
of letting me get my cogwheel spinning. Once I’ve ascended with the
Dongxuan Sutra, it will be easier with Jadeskin. But how do I push
the Dongxuan Sutra to get the cogwheels moving?” Han Sen thought
about it for a long time, but no ideas were coming to him. It
seemed impossible.</p>
<p>Being too strong had actually become a serious problem. Because
his body was tied to four geno arts, getting just one of the geno
arts to King class wasn’t enough to push his self-universe
cogwheel.</p>
<p>Han Sen only had one body, so it was impossible for him to use
all four geno arts to level up at the same time. It was a scary
thought, but even the conflict of his power and blood-pulse would
be enough to annihilate his body.</p>
<p>“It is fortunate that I only have four geno arts. If I had more,
I could never make it to King class. Not even the holy pills could
make my self-universe cogwheel move.” Han Sen tried to comfort
himself.</p>
<p>“Using my own power will never work. I have to use some sort of
external power. But if I level up to King class using an external
power, a single accident or loss of control could cause something
far worse than failure to happen. My whole body would be
destroyed.” All the time he had spent thinking hadn’t brought Han
Sen to a conclusion.</p>
<p>“I must find a reliable resource of power that is both stable
and destructive. In that case, I may have to ask someone deified to
help me. But what kind of deified elite would sacrifice something
to help me? And who could I even trust?” Han Sen wondered. He
couldn’t think of any reliable deified elites.</p>
<p>Of all the deifieds he knew, Han Sen trusted the little red bird
the most. But the little red bird’s power was a little too
volatile, and its ability to control its power wasn’t very refined.
It couldn’t perform such delicate work.</p>
<p>Out of the deifieds who had the necessary level of control over
their power, Han Sen thought Yisha would be the most reliable. It
was the first name that popped into his head when he thought about
who he trusted the most.</p>
<p>Yisha was actually his enemy, though. Even Han Sen was shocked
to recall that little fact.</p>
<p>But despite that regrettable fact, he couldn’t think of any
other deified that was as reliable as her.</p>
<p>“It is a shame Yisha is still in Narrow-Moon. She cannot be the
one to help me. I cannot leave King’s Kingdom,” Han Sen thought
with a wry smile.</p>
<p>“If I cannot ask for someone’s help, then I will have to borrow
someone’s power. That will be the only way.” Han Sen’s eyes wavered
with uncertainty.</p>
<p>Han Sen was good with Yin Yang Blast and similar techniques. If
he could borrow some stable and strong powers, perhaps he would be
able to push the self-universe cogwheel.</p>
<p>But doing this was like dancing on the edge of a knife. Han Sen
would be destroyed if things went south.</p>
<p>Han Sen needed to use a power that was stronger than his own to
push the self-universe cogwheel. He needed to maintain absolute,
perfect control over a power that didn’t even belong to him. A
minor mistake would be enough to cause a grand tragedy.</p>
<p>“What a headache!” Han Selt thought, rubbing his temples. He
still couldn’t come up with a solution to his woes, though.</p>
<p>“My Prince, Princess Ten Bai Ling Shuang wishes to see you,”
said Lilly’s voice from outside the door.</p>
<p>“Why is she here?” Han Sen frowned. Because the Extreme King had
been searching multiple planets for traces of Mad Sword, Han Sen
hadn’t collected the fifty King class xenogeneic genes he was owed
by Bai Ling Shuang. There was no sense in drawing attention to
their little deal. He hadn’t expected her to come and visit him,
though.</p>
<p>When Han Sen entered the living room, he found Bai Ling Shuang
there drinking tea. She looked very relaxed.</p>
<p>“Princess Ten, why have you taken the time to come and visit
me?” Han Sen asked casually, sitting down on the chair next to Bai
Ling Shuang.</p>
<p>“Because of the deal we struck. I have brought you the items we
discussed.” Bai Ling Shuang raised her hand, and the two maids
behind her presented Han Sen with a very large box.</p>
<p>“Brother Sixteen, you may count them if you wish, but there are
fifty King class xenogeneic genes. No more and no less,” Bai Ling
Shuang said with a smile.</p>
<p>“Sister Ten, you should have just told me. I would have gone and
picked them up. You didn’t have to come all the way here to
personally deliver them.” Han Sen laughed and opened the box. He
counted fifty King class xenogeneic genes.</p>
<p>“I am here because I have another big proposition for you,
brother.” Bai Ling Shuang waved her hand, and all the maids
dispersed.</p>
<p>When he saw Bai Ling Shuang’s gesture, Han Sen turned and
indicated that Lilly should depart, too. The hall emptied out, and
only the two of them were left sitting in the room.</p>
<p>“I have a reliable source who has confirmed that the exams will
not be continuing this year. They will use the Rot Bone Mountain
ranking. Brother Sixteen, you might be number one. In addition to
the deified xenogeneic treasure, you will be given permission to
enter Destiny’s Tower once. Do you plan to sell your admission
ticket?” Bai Ling Shuang asked, her beautiful eyes staring directly
at Han Sen.</p>
<p>“Really?” Han Sen asked happily. Receiving permission to enter
Destiny’s Tower would be great.</p>
