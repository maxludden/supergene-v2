<p>“Luckily, you only killed Dragon Thirteen. She was not one of the prestigious nine. Her death was inconsequential, so the grudge won’t be all that deep. Now that Yu Shanxin has interceded on your behalf, the Dragon shouldn’t bother you anymore. Do you think you can remove the spell on me now?” Xius had actually come up to Han Sen to get the spell removed.</p>

<p>“We’re still in territory belonging to the Dragon. Let’s wait until I’m out of it first.” Han Sen resumed walking.</p>

<p>“The Dragon won’t change their minds. Now that they’ve forgiven you and made a promise to Yu Shanxin, they won’t turn back on their word. Dragon territory is now the safest place for you. They wouldn’t dare let you die here. It’s hard to say what might happen after you leave. If something happens to you out there, whoever kills you might not even have any ties to the Dragon.” Xius rolled her eyes.</p>

<p>“So, you’re saying I should stay in the lands of the Dragon?” Han Sen lifted his lips.</p>

<p>“There is no need. Yu Shanxin helped you, and he represents Sky Palace. Before anyone thinks of attacking you, they’ll have to weigh the consequences. And no one will want to incite the wrath of Sky Palace. Unless there’s someone highly motivated by revenge, no individual will seek to kill you. At least not immediately, while things have yet to simmer down,” Xius said.</p>

<p>Han Sen looked at Xius. “Yu Shanxin killed so many Sky Palace students. Why was he allowed to remain there?”</p>

<p>Xius hesitated before speaking. “That’s complicated, and it’s not something the Sky like to talk about with outsiders. I know that his teacher was strong enough to be considered an elder. He was framed, and then he died. Then, his memory was tarnished with the crime of treason. But no one could have expected Yu Shanxin to react in such an insane way. They were going to kick him out of Sky Palace, but Yu Shanxin brought the coffin back and started killing people. Things eventually calmed down after he reached the leader. Anyone who was involved in the conspiracy, like the elders and students, were killed by Yu Shanxin.”</p>

<p>The reason Yu Shanxin was allowed to stay in Sky Palace has something to do with that. He couldn’t obtain the seat of an elder. He owned an island in Sky Palace, but no one knows what his job is,” Xius said, then looked at Han Sen. “That is all I know. And it’s all just hearsay. Outsiders aren’t told much about what happens there.”</p>

<p>Han Sen nodded. Yu Shanxin had come to save him, and whether it was an order from Sky Palace or something the man had done on his own whim, it did not matter. Han Sen now owed him a big one. But a man like him would probably never need help.</p>

<p>They walked to the spaceport, and when they reached it, he still hadn’t removed the spell placed on Xius.</p>

<p>When they arrived, all the ships refused to accept Han Sen as a passenger. The guards even mocked him, telling Han Sen to simply fly back to Sky Palace, and that there was no need for him to take their ships.</p>

<p>Han Sen was not mad, though. He looked at Xius. “Xius, you have your own ship, don’t you? You can take me.”</p>

<p>Xius had no choice but to take him herself. They went back to Sky Palace.</p>

<p>There was no danger along the way, and Xius successfully brought Han Sen back to Sky Palace.</p>

<p>“Without an invitation from Sky Palace, this is as far as I can go. Can you remove the spell now?” Xius patiently asked Han Sen.</p>

<p>Han Sen smiled and said, “You have a spell on me too. What’s the rush?”</p>

<p>“I’m not loafing around like you, with nothing better to do! I have business to conduct,” Xius said shortly.</p>

<p>After all that time and travel, her patience with Han Sen was running on fumes. She just wanted to be free of the spell and get as far away from Han Sen as she possibly could.</p>

<p>Han Sen touched the bite marks on his neck—the ones she had left behind. The bite marks hadn’t disappeared, so it was obviously not an ordinary power.</p>

<p>“I was thinking that we’ve been through a lot. And God only knows when our paths might cross again. Let’s keep a souvenir to remind each other of our time together. The next time I see these marks, I will think of you. You should cherish the souvenir I have given you, too.” After that, Han Sen flew back to Sky Palace.</p>

<p>“Han Sen, you *sshole!” Xius was mad, but Han Sen was already in Sky Palace. She could not go inside without permission.</p>

<p>Xius had no choice but to return to the Gana. She wanted to run some tests and find out what Han Sen had done to her body.</p>

<p>“If I can break the spell on me, I will make you die. Then, you can really see the power of a Gana’s kiss,” Xius thought furiously.</p>

<p>But Han Sen was so scary. Xius did not dare trigger the Gana’s kiss, in case they both ended up hurting each other.</p>

<p>Han Sen’s super god body could remove all spells, so he wasn’t afraid of the Gana’s kiss. In fact, he wanted to take a look at how powerful it was.</p>

<p>Back in Sky Palace, Han Sen was welcomed back by the students. Everyone had heard that he had killed Sharon and Dragon Thirteen and of his adventure in Return Ruin Sea.</p>

<p>To the Demon and the Dragon, this was a grand insult. But to Sky Palace, it was a thing to take pride in.</p>

<p>Han Sen handed over the silver Beginning of Ancient God and the xenogeneic genes from the Ancient God space. He received permission to visit the Holy House and collect xenogeneic genes.</p>

<p>Han Sen did not plan on learning any new geno arts. All he wanted to do was level up, and so he didn’t go.</p>

<p>Aside from those rewards, Han Sen was granted the title of Teacher. He could enjoy many benefits now. Some places that weren’t open to students were now freely accessible to him.</p>

<p>For example, Han Sen had previously been forced to hunt in Xuanyuan Cave. But with the title of Teacher, he could go to Rare Beast Island. There were many xenogeneics there, and it was a far better place than Xuanyuan Cave.</p>

<p>There were many more benefits, too, but teachers had responsibilities of their own. Every year, he would have to teach geno arts to students for ten days.</p>

<p>He could teach whatever he wanted, but nothing like Under the Sky. That was limited by level, and so he could not teach that.</p>

<p>Not many outsiders could earn the title of Teacher, but the people of Sky Palace had no problem with Han Sen’s promotion. They were actually excited to hear what he would tell them.</p>

<p>After all, Han Sen had killed Sharon, who was as strong as Lone Bamboo. The students were interested in his geno arts. And the stories of Han Sen’s battles were so outstanding. All the students believed he deserved the title.</p>

<p>Every year, teachers had to teach for ten days. But some busy teachers had no time, and so they were allowed to stack up their teaching requirements for up to ten years. Because of this, Han Sen was not in a rush.</p>

<p>Thousand Feather Crane and the Yun sisters met up with Han Sen. They went to practice in the White Jade Building. Han Sen planned to check out the buildings behind it, hoping that the Jade Airs there would take his Jadeskin up to Marquise class.</p>

<p>In combat, Jadeskin was much more useful than the Blood-Pulse Sutra.</p>
