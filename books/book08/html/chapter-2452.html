<h3>Chapter 2452</h3>

<p>Bao Qin’s long fingers strummed the harp in his hands, and the
notes he played were like waves of substance chains. They spread
out through the clouds, and the sea of blue clouds moved and
vibrated with the rhythm of the harp’s music.</p>
<p>The clouds weren’t the only things responding to the music,
either. Every substance, including sets of armor, weaponry, and
xenogeneic treasures, began to physically twist and warp under the
spell of the harp’s song. They became as limp as cooked noodles,
waving along with the melody of the harp.</p>
<p>The large bodies of the giant cloud dragons were deformed by the
music, and with every new, twisting note, more of their bones
shattered. Before long, the great dragons had been reduced to
boneless meat sticks. The sight made Han Sen’s scalp prickle.</p>
<p>He didn’t know what sort of sonic substance chain power Bao Qin
was wielding, but it was crushing every single thing in sight. It
was way too scary.</p>
<p>Even with that power, Bao Qin was far from having the upper
hand. That black form of the demon spirit kept flashing between the
sonic forces. Han Sen couldn’t see what sort of Area it had
employed, but the creature’s powers seemed to be protecting it
against Bao Qin’s deforming power. However, Bao Qin’s attacks were
slowly reducing the demon spirit’s speed and power.</p>
<p>The demon spirit’s eyes were like those of a ghost, and they
stared unblinkingly at Bao Qin. Bao Qin met the gaze of the demon
spirit many times, but Han Sen didn’t dare use his new beast soul
to jump into the demon spirit’s eyes.</p>
<p>Han Sen didn’t know how strong the Blood Eye Evil God’s power
truly was, and he didn’t know what sort of powers were able to
restrict it. That demon spirit had demonstrated frightening
abilities so far, and so Han Sen gave up on the idea of entering
its eyes.</p>
<p>As the fight went on, Han Sen quickly realized something
depressing: Bao Qin wasn’t the demon spirit’s equal. The monster
was slowly boxing him in.</p>
<p>Bao Qin made many attempts to escape, but try as he might, he
couldn’t shake off the demon spirit. The situation was growing
increasingly dangerous for the Extreme King.</p>
<p>Han Sen was hoping that Bao Qin and the demon spirit would end
up injuring each other equally, so that Han Sen could swoop in and
finish them both. But it had become evident that there was too much
of a power gap between the two fighters; Bao Qin didn’t stand a
chance of even injuring the demon spirit.</p>
<p>If Bao Qin was killed, the protection that his eyes offered Han
Sen would be destroyed. Han Sen would have to make a getaway. When
that happened, the demon spirit would probably target him.</p>
<p>Even if Han Sen wanted to make an escape now, his opportunities
to do so had mostly disappeared. All the cloud beast xenogeneics
had either died or run away. Bao Qin wasn’t going to be meeting the
eyes of another creature anytime soon, and so Han Sen couldn’t
escape using his Blood Eye Evil God beast soul.</p>
<p>That beast soul could only interact with the eyes of others. It
didn’t have mirror powers like the ones that Miss Mirror used. If
Han Sen wanted to escape unseen, he needed his host to make eye
contact with another.</p>
<p>Pang!</p>
<p>The demon spirit landed a blow across Bao Qin’s chest, tearing
his armor. The godly muscles of Bao Qin’s jade-like chest were
shredded, and blood welled within the wound.</p>
<p>But the godly blood didn’t spill out. The blood became black,
smoky dust that rose like steam. It billowed up into a small,
rather unsettling cloud.</p>
<p>Seeing the smoky, dust-like god blood, the demon spirit licked
its lips hungrily and teleported over to Bao Qin.</p>
<p>Ding!</p>
<p>One of the strings of Bao Qin’s harp broke, and a new burst of
blood turned into smoke and opened like a flower amidst the
clouds.</p>
<p>“Bao Qin isn’t going to survive this…” Han Sen made his
decision. He turned off the Wanjie Rubix Cube, and when the injured
Bao Qin met the gaze of the demon spirit, he jumped into the demon
spirit’s eyes.</p>
<p>“Please let this work,” Han Sen prayed desperately. The eyes of
the demon spirit were like the soulless eyes of a shark. They were
red like fire. They looked rather transparent. Han Sen didn’t know
if the Blood Eye Evil God beast soul could find refuge within
them.</p>
<p>In the next second, Han Sen realized that his vision had indeed
changed. When he realized that he was looking directly at the
injured Bao Qin, happiness and relief flooded through him. He knew
he was now residing inside the eyes of the demon spirit.</p>
<p>Looking out from the demon spirit’s eyes was different than Han
Sen had initially imagined it would be. Because the demon’s eyes
were so red, Han Sen had thought that looking through them would
provide a view that was tinted and murky.</p>
<p>But instead, the view from the demon’s eyes was actually
entirely black and white. Everything Han Sen could see was a blur
of various shades of grey.</p>
<p>It took Han Sen only a moment to realize that his eyes couldn’t
keep up with the eyes of the demon spirit. He used his Purple-Eye
Butterfly to lessen the disparity between his vision and the demon
spirit’s, and the images before him quickly resolved. Unless he had
the Purple-Eye Butterfly active, it was like looking out of a
high-speed train with an extremely narrow field of view. Everything
he saw on the outside zoomed by at incredible speed, and objects
became blurry and difficult to make out.</p>
<p>With the Purple-Eye Butterfly, though, Han Sen could see
everything. The demon spirit hovered in front of Bao Qin. Every
string on the man’s harp was broken, and the demon spirit’s
ghost-like hands then went through the harp to pierce right into
Bao Qin’s chest.</p>
<p>The smoke from Bao Qin’s deified blood was spreading. Bao Qin
gritted his teeth, and his body released a very bright light. The
man’s fingers reached for the stringless harp.</p>
<p>Then, some invisible strings appeared beneath his fingers. Every
string released a weird sonic power that tore through space to
create a giant space vortex. The vortex pulled in the nearby
clouds, and then it began to pull on the demon spirit and Bao Qin
himself.</p>
<p>In order to resist the force of the vortex, the demon spirit had
to teleport away. Bao Qin’s body, on the other hand, was sucked
into the space vortex. After a short amount of time, the space
vortex disappeared.</p>
<p>The demon spirit grunted coldly. It turned around and returned
to its Sea Demon Car. The giant cloud dragons were all dead, so the
carriage was simply hanging in place.</p>
<p>The demon spirit waved its hand, and the cloud sea began to
roll. The clouds became tornados that drew in and consumed even
more clouds. Soon, the tornados transformed into new cloud dragons
that flew over to the Sea Demon Car.</p>
<p>Han Sen was frozen. The powers and techniques of this demon
spirit were crazy. It was difficult for Han Sen to comprehend the
power it must have taken to summon so many cloud dragons so
quickly.</p>
<p>“I cannot let him find me. Even blinding him wouldn’t be enough
to let me escape successfully,” Han Sen believed.</p>
<p>The demon spirit was back inside the Sea Demon Car. The carriage
turned and headed for the deep sea of the clouds.</p>
<p>The xenogeneics and cloud beasts all around were now dead. All
that remained was the carriage that the demon spirit traveled in.
The Sea Demon Car had remained undamaged through the entire fight;
Han Sen couldn’t imagine what material it must have been made
of.</p>
<p>Han Sen wanted to use the eyes of the cloud dragons to leave,
but the cloud dragons didn’t dare to look directly at the demon
spirit. The demon spirit didn’t look at them, either, and so Han
Sen couldn’t find the opportunity he needed.</p>
<p>“There is no need to worry. As long as the demon spirit doesn’t
notice me, he will eventually look into the eyes of another
creature. Sooner or later, I will be able to escape.” As the demon
spirit continued to remain oblivious to Han Sen’s presence, Han Sen
finally began to relax.</p>
<p>Inside the stone carriage, the demon spirit stared forward
without closing its eyes. Perhaps the creature’s eye simply
couldn’t be closed.</p>
<p>As he looked through the eyes of the demon spirit, Han Sen could
see the interior of the stone carriage. Words were written across
the stone walls.</p>
<p>Because the demon spirit’s vision was completely black and
white, Han Sen couldn’t tell what the true colors of the words
were. Most things that Han Sen looked at were represented by grey
tones.</p>
<p>The words had been written in a tiny script, and each letter was
no bigger than a fly. But when Han Sen looked closer, he realized
that the words were all ancient and strong. It was like there was
an infinite, amazing universe residing within them.</p>
