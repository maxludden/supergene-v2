      “So, if that is a good thing, why are we fighting? Bleeding is no good,”
      Han Sen said with caution, stepping backwards as he kept up the lie.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Blood is all. We are proud of blood, and we use blood to celebrate. If
      you are an heir of the Qin family, then your sacrifice is even more
      welcome. When I become sovereign to the legion, I will handsomely reward
      your family.” Mister Li, as he spoke, came nearer to Han Sen.
    </p>
    <p>
      Not wanting to get too close, Han Sen leaped up towards where the
      Nine-Life Cat was crouching. Han Sen’s pendant had been acting up again,
      and it burned with great intensity when he neared the creature. It was
      directly reacting to the Nine-Life Cat, not the coffin.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Nine-Life Cat pendant was able to suppress blue blood, and the
      creature itself suppressed the coffin. So, if Han Sen was in need of a
      deus ex machina to wholly alter the situation, that one would be as
      appropriate as any.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mister Li looked at Han Sen and started to follow, but when he saw the
      Nine-Life Cat, he frowned, quit the chase, and looked at it. Han Sen was
      delighted by this reaction, so he made sure to stay as close to the cat as
      he possibly could.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mister Li’s eyes were fixed on the cat that hadn’t moved, and he said,
      “The coffin is open. Why aren’t you leaving? Do you really think I won’t
      kill you?”
    </p>
    <p>
      The cat heard this and squinted its eyes and moved its lips, as if the
      man’s words had elicited a smile. It jumped atop Han Sen’s head, which
      came as a surprise to Han Sen, but then looked down on Mister Li as if it
      were mocking him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Han Sen, acknowledging the cat had no intention of hurting him, thought to
      himself, “Wow, does the cat really hate the leader? What’s going on here?”
    </p>
    <p>Mister Li looked at the cat and jumped towards them both.</p>
    <p>
      Mister Li’s attention was unnaturally affixed to the cat now, but
      unfortunately for Han Sen, the cat was on his head. If he wanted his head
      to remain upon his shoulders, he had to evade each incoming blow as best
      he could.
    </p>
    <p>
      The pendant on his chest was burning hotter and hotter, though. It shone
      red, as it seared the skin it hung across, and soon after, his entire body
      glowed red. And all of a sudden, Han Sen felt as if he possessed the power
      to destroy the universe.
    </p>
    <p>Han Sen punched Mister Li and sent him flying.</p>
    <p>
      Mister Li was sent barreling through the air, arcing down towards the
      ground. When he crash-landed, he skidded through the tiled ground for ten
      meters, spilling blue blood from his mouth.
    </p>
    <p>
      “You do have the relic! Who are you?” Mister Li looked at Han Sen and
      asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      “I told you; I am the heir of Han Jinzhi.” Han Sen’s pendant augmented his
      power, fueling him with a strength he had never felt before.
    </p>
    <p>
      “If you truly are, then you should die.” As Mister Li looked dim and swung
      his fist towards Han Sen.
    </p>
    <p>
      Feeling overwhelmingly confident in his newfound power, Han Sen did not
      even try to dodge this time. He threw a punch to meet with the incoming
      fist.
    </p>
    <p>Pang!</p>
    <p>
      Mister Li had no hope of matching with that strength, and again, he was
      lifted off the ground and sent spinning through the foggy atmosphere of
      the shelter. Han Sen leaped into the air and landed on a rooftop directly
      before Mister Li, for whom the tables had turned.
    </p>
    <p>
      Han Sen unleashed a barrage of punches on Mister Li, with the speed and
      ferocity of a tornado. Each hit was the lash of a spiraling wind, and the
      power he delivered in each strike was unlike anything he had ever felt
      before.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mister Li was able to dodge a few strikes, but when the next ones landed,
      they were devastating. His defense was broken, and his body was next in
      line.
    </p>
    <p>
      Like a boxing bag propped up for training, Han Sen unleashed all the power
      he could on Mister Li. His body was twisted and disfigured.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Alu-Alu-Alu!” The excitement of this ability to punch with manic speed
      and wretched power was a thrill like no other, and Han Sen imagined
      himself as Xie Qing King, pummeling an unfortunate foe into oblivion. To
      destroy with nothing but one’s fist instigated a primal ecstasy.
    </p>
    <p>Boom!</p>
    <p>
      Mister Li was sent flying once more, and he crashed against the coffin.
    </p>
    <p>Han Sen wished to fly over there and finish him off.</p>
    <p>
      But Mister Li, with his body being little more than a sack of bruised
      organs and broken bones, stuttered to say, “Han Jinzhi broke my legion,
      and now his heir breaks my mission? Curse your foul lineage! I am on the
      precipice of becoming a god, and you dare do this to me? The right is
      mine!”
    </p>
    <p>“A god? You seek to become a god?” Han Sen was shocked hearing this.</p>
    <p>
      “You are Han Jinzhi’s heir. Have you not learned a thing from your
      predecessors? Blood Legion’s entire purpose is to assemble a faction of
      godhood,” Mister Li coughed up more blood.
    </p>
    <p>
      “What kind of god could you hope to become?” Han Sen asked with a frown.
    </p>
    <p>
      “You must break through the vacuum and reach the Fifth Sanctuary. Then you
      become a God. As much as I would have liked this, it seems you have the
      highest chance of success.” Mister Li said.
    </p>
    <p>“And why could Han Jinzhi not do this?” Han Sen asked.</p>
    <p>
      “It was nothing more than a fantasy for him. Like me, he was too weak to
      achieve such greatness,” Mister Li mocked.
    </p>
    <p>
      Han Sen wanted to kill Mister Li, but there were a number of questions he
      wished to ask first. So, he asked, “Why does Blood Legion feature spirit
      members? Who created the organization, initially?”
    </p>
    <p>
      Mister Li wiped away the blood oozing from the corner of his lips and
      said, “Are you really his heir? It seems to me that no one has told you a
      thing.”
    </p>
    <p>“Does it matter?” Han Sen responded.</p>
    <p>
      “Ultimately, I suppose it does not.” Mister Li paused to regather some of
      his composure, then went on to explain, “Blood Legion was formed through a
      union between humans and spirits. There is no contradiction.”
    </p>
    <p>“What does that mean?” Han Sen frowned.</p>
    <p>Mister Li smiled and said, “Where do you think we come from?”</p>
    <p>
      Han Sen’s heart jumped against his ribs, and he blurted out, “Was Blood
      Legion’s creator from the sanctuary? Did he then go to the Alliance, like
      Asura?”
    </p>
    <p>
      Mister Li shook his head and explained, “You’re half right, but Asura? He
      was nothing. He was a petty but fortunate individual that was able to slay
      a damaged god. Our creator was the one who did manage to break through the
      vacuum and reach the Fifth Sanctuary.”
