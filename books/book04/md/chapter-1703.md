The crystal armor on Ji Yanran became the crystal shoes again. They started running towards Han Sen. Without the crystal shoes, though, Ji Yanran started to fall from the sky. She wasn’t strong enough to participate in the fight in her ordinary condition.

Zach, seeing the crystal shoes leave, raced over to Ji Yanran with the express desire of killing her.

Golden Growler roared. He suddenly made himself as big as a battleship and absorbed the hit Zach was going to deliver. In doing so, he managed to save Ji Yanran and Bao’er both.

A gaping hole was left in Golden Growler’s armor and body as a result, though. Fortunately, it didn’t hurt as much when he was that size. As Golden Growler roared, Ji Yanran and Bao’er were able to get to safety with Luo Lan.

Since Ji Yanran had now lost her crystal shoes, Little Angel and Golden Growler were fighting Zach and Zagu desperately. Fortunately, their opponents had already been damaged by Ji Yanran and Bao’er. If this wasn’t the case, things would have been far worse for Little Angel and Golden Growler.

The crystal shoes landed right before Han Sen. He put them on. At the same time, the glove armor returned to just being a glove again.

*Boom!*

The officer stabbed a number of holes into the ground. He was breaking the planet, but he wasn’t managing to hit Han Sen. The crystal shoes and their power pulled Han Sen away, preventing him from being stabbed.

“How is that possible?” The officer was in shock. He looked at Han Sen and the crystal shoes in much confusion now.

The crystal armor was something special, and ordinary people could not make use of it. Once the shoes recognized someone as their master, they would never betray that master or be used by someone else unless the owner was killed.

The reason the officer hadn’t killed Ji Yanran was because the shoes would have selected Han Sen as their new master once she was dead. He had the Northern King Glove, after all. It was highly probable that the shoes, given a choice, would select Han Sen as well.

But the officer did not expect the crystal shoes to willingly follow Han Sen and not strictly remain with Ji Yanran.

Han Sen had been very worried about his family being put in danger during his absence, so he had left the shoes with Ji Yanran. The shoes really did help the family, too, while they were in danger with him gone.

The crystal shoes never truly obeyed Ji Yanran. When they sensed that Han Sen was in danger, they went over to their master and slipped themselves onto his feet

Han Sen didn’t like wearing them, but fashion principles weren’t much of a concern at the moment. He had an enemy he needed to defeat.

The crystal shoes didn’t become crystal armor around Han Sen, though. They became shoes and the glove remained a glove. Neither item shielded him in the shape of an armorset.

“It’s useless! Even if you have the crystal shoes and the glove, you are still so very weak!” the officer said savagely, swinging his sword once more.

The fiery wings of the officer sent him flying towards Han Sen with the sword.

Han Sen felt the shoes’ powers dragging him back a few thousand meters. It was too fast for Han Sen to decide how to react himself.

The crystal shoes on his feet provided him speed. They were much stronger than when they were taking the shape of an entire armor. And the shoes were far faster now than they were when Ji Yanran was making use of them.

But the officer was still able to catch up. The fiery wings on his back could go faster than the crystal shoes.

Seeing the sword approach, Han Sen remained calm. He went towards it.

Han Sen had the crystal shoes and the glove. He had nothing shielding his body. He had a geno armor inside his Sea of Soul, but he could not use it while he was wearing those other two items.

Even if he could put it on, it still wouldn’t be very good against the Western King Sword.

Now, all Han Sen hoped he could do was use his gloved fist to hit the sword. If he missed, he expected he’d be cut in half.

Before this, Han Sen had failed many times. He couldn’t block the sword no matter how many times he tried, and neither could he evade it. Now that he had no armor, this was his last chance.

The officer looked cold, and he didn’t think Han Sen could block it. Just like all the other times, he expected he’d be able to deliver a cruel blow to Han Sen. And furthermore, Han Sen’s body had no protection because there was no armor on him. He could kill Han Sen and take the crystal shoes and glove all for himself.

Stay Up Late and the others all turned to look at Han Sen now. He and Han Yufei both knew that if he was unable to successfully block the next strike, he would die.

“Look at his eyes! Look at his eyes!” Stay Up Late shouted out, despite expecting such a call to be practically pointless.

Heart Eye was a technique that was very difficult to teach. When Stay Up Late learned it from the officer, he had practiced the skill for a very long time. After many repeated failures, Stay Up Late managed to wrap his head around it and learn it successfully.

Stay Up Late had learned it in the course of training, however. The officer had taught him by using the technique slowly.

months of training with it, Stay Up Late found success and managed to learn it It resulted in others calling him a genius.

Han Sen was in the midst of genuine combat, and there was hardly any respite. He couldn’t dedicate much of his mind to learning new things right now.

The sword and fist collided with each other, but the sword was like a shot that slipped by. It didn’t touch Han Sen’s fist and was instead going straight for his chest.

“He didn’t block it!” Stay Up Late’s face changed.

“It’s over!” Han Yufei looked ill.

Ji Yanran and Luo Lan were unable to see the situation, and they had no clue Han Sen was in danger.

“It’s over!” The officer could feel his sword tearing through fabric and penetrating flesh. It made him feel very good.

After this, he would receive all the crystal king armors. If he could combine them all together, he’d have no issue surviving out there.

Seeing the skin on Han Sen’s chest start to break, he added more strength. He had to ensure that he killed Han Sen in a single hit, without giving him any chance of survival.
