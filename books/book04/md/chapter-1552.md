Han Sen wanted to kill the little Ice Seahorse, but Bao’er seemed to like it. This prompted him to drop the idea.

“I never thought the chimenea would bear a creature like that. I wonder what it is,” Jade Little Lion said.

“It’s alive, so it cannot be the relic.” Little Fairy looked annoyed.

“I don’t know if it is the relic or not, but it would be best if we don’t provoke it. The Black Seahorses are super creatures, but it can snare them with those chains with ease. They were completely unable to resist. The creature in the chimenea must be strong. I don’t think we can fight it,” Han Sen said, and then walked forward.

Everyone was of the same mind. Giving up on the chimenea, they then opted to try somewhere else.

The little Ice Seahorse followed after Bao’er. At first, the creature missed its group of seahorses, but after a while of playing with Bao’er, its mood turned happy again.

Han Sen spent the next few days traversing the ruins, but he couldn’t find anything.

Of course, Han Sen did not care too much if he did not get a reward for the current endeavors, as he was spending a lot of time practicing the skill he learned from the Destiny’s Tower. Once he was done, he was going to return there with Starsea Beast and see if he could take the treasure out of the tower with him.

( .c om ) The seven items in there had the possibility of being the relics that they were all seeking.

Little Fairy and the others searched in the ruins, as well. Han Sen, in the meantime, just took it for a nice trip and nothing more. He didn’t expect to find anything else that was decent.

One particular day, after two weeks of traveling and searching, everything seemed to be the same for Han Sen. He sat on Starsea Beast’s back and practiced the skill he was in the midst of learning. But suddenly, he felt his Life Door shake, and the pumping of his blood accelerated.

The blood in his body wasn’t being driven by his heart anymore. Its rush was sustained by the Life Door now. And with each fresh pump, new changes came along with it. It was a brand-new cycle, and it brought changes to the way Han Sen’s body operated.

The changes did not just apply to his blood. The blood was simply the catalyst for everything else. Han Sen’s cells and genes were undergoing direct changes.

Han Sen’s appearance mostly did not change. All the changes were internal, save for his black eyes that became red.

Aside from his eye color, though, Han Sen seemed exactly the same. There were a lot of changes to his insides, however.

Han Sen felt as if his bones and flesh had been wholly rebuilt. His entire body actually felt much heavier, by a few multiples. And yet, his body and bones were like a bird’s. His blood was not carried by vessels, as it was directly entwined with his bones and flesh.

These changes made Han Sen’s body feel far more sensitive. He was able to control himself better, and even his base power seemed to be much stronger.

When Han Sen looked at Starsea Beast and Jade Little Lion, though, he was given a shock. His vision had been altered with his new red eyes. With that red vision, Han Sen could see the blood that coursed through their bodies.

Or at least, that was what Han Sen thought at first. After a closer examination, Han Sen noticed it wasn’t the blood he was observing.

If the blood was flowing, then its course must have been dictated by the heart. But this was not what Han Sen saw. A red force was inside their bodies, just flowing, and there was a saturation depicted in different areas on them. There was no set route to the flow he was seeing.

“Is that their lifeforce?” Han Sen guessed, although he was not sure.

Han Sen wanted to get a closer look, but he felt a pain in his head and his body started to twitch. It was like he was getting stabbed by a number of needles.

Han Sen stopped the skill immediately, and when he did that, the pain and needle-like sensation went away immediately. The changes in his body reverted back to how they were before he practiced the skill, and the blood began pumping from his heart, just like it used to.

( .c om ) Han Sen could feel his body was now rather weak, and he thought to himself, “This skill costs a lot of energy. I only had it activated for a few minutes, and already my body felt as if it was on the verge of collapsing. I wonder what my strength is like when I use this transformative skill? And was the red flow I saw their lifeforce?”

Han Sen rested for the next half-day. His body soon returned to normal, and there were no lasting effects or issues.

“It’s time to go back to the white metal tower to collect the treasure there.” Han Sen had also thought of a way in which he might get Little Fairy and Jade Little Lion out of his hair for a time. He told them it would be best to split up and search separately. So, Han Sen ended up just bringing Bao’er, Little Silver, and Little Star with him to the white tower.

The Little Ice Seahorse followed Bao’er, determined not to leave. As a result, Han Sen had no choice but to allow him to come.

Jade Little Lion was still, by all accounts, an outsider. And Little Fairy could be a touch suspicious. As a result, he didn’t want them to come with him.

Starsea Beast brought Han Sen to a glacier mountain, the one that was populated by deadly flowers.

Starsea Beast was super class, and casting its traveling skill no longer cost it as much energy. It brought Han Sen right to the doorstep of the white tower.

Han Sen was excited, and he hastily threw the door open. He scrambled up to the top floor and saw the seven pedestals of treasure were still intact and untouched. He breathed a sigh of relief.

“It looks like God’s Retribution really couldn’t learn the skill. If he could, he would have come back here before me. Either that, or he can learn it and just hasn’t finished yet,” Han Sen thought.

Seeing the seven treasures sitting neatly on the stone pedestals, Han Sen cast the skill. His body engaged with all those weird changes again, and then he reached his hand out to see if he could go past the Space-Vortex Shield and grab the treasure.

Han Sen did this very carefully. His hand approached the prizes slowly. But when his nails brushed the end of the platform, the tips of his fingernails disappeared.

Han Sen’s face changed. He pulled his hand back and said, “This skill doesn’t even let me go past the Space-Vortex Shield?”

Han Sen had spent a lot of effort in coming here, and after all that, this was the result. It was dismal, and it sent a chill running through his heart.

As this happened, though, Han Sen heard a loud sound come from outside. It rocked the construct itself. Then, he heard the crying noises that were all too familiar to him.

Han Sen’s face changed. He went up to the window and pushed it open.

Han Sen looked down from there, and it was just as he thought. Eleven Black Seahorses were situated right outside Destiny’s Tower. They were blocking the entrance, too.

The eleven Black Seahorses repeatedly cried at the tower, making extremely loud screaming noises.

“Shit! Those Black Seahorses are really p*ssed, and they even brought the chimenea with them. If I knew they’d come after me, I wouldn’t have brought the little Ice Seahorse.” Han Sen thought the Black Seahorses had come there to rescue the small creature. The notion made him feel depressed.
