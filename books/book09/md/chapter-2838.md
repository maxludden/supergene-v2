  In the Extreme King's garden, Han Sen was sitting reading books. The lady who looked like Wan'er was sitting nearby watching him.

Han Sen's eyebrows noticeably rose. After a while of enduring the gaze, he could not help but ask Wan'er, who was actually God in disguise, "Can you not look at me like that?"

God had been looking at him for a long time. Even as a God, the being should have been tired of watching all of that.

After agreeing to bring God home, Han Sen had no choice but to bring God to the Extreme King. God had also noticed the fact that Han Sen had become smaller.

God smiled and said, "Only you are interesting here. If I don't stare at you, what else can I look at?"

"Extreme King elites are everywhere, such as Bai King and those elders. They are very interesting elites. Feel free to stare at them." Han Sen obscenely sold out the Extreme King.

"I am tired of looking at them," God said.

Han Sen was speechless. If Bai King learned someone had said that about him, he wondered what he would think.

"The universe is so big. Powerful nobles and xenogeneics exist everywhere. You can go check them out." Han Sen felt sad as he spoke.

"I am not invincible. It is not like I can watch whoever I want. I, at least, need to find some interesting creatures. Then, I can go see them," God patiently explained.

Han Sen did not know what else to say, so he casually said, "If you like seeing other creatures that much, it would be nice if there was a geno being scroll fight to watch. You could watch them all."

When God heard what Han Sen said, it nodded and said, "Your suggestion is not bad. We can have another geno being scroll fight, but the geno being scroll fights are fairly boring. The creatures that fight aren't even god class. There should be a god fight instead."

"Are you serious?" Han Sen looked at God with shock.

Han Sen had never heard of the geno being scroll opening on a whim. In the past, it was supposed to be once every 100 years, and the highest rank allowed in were kings.

The last geno being scroll bouts ended a few years ago. There was still a long time to go until 100 years had gone by. The geno being scroll should not have been able to open again so soon.

Yet God wanted there to be a geno being scroll fight now and one for beings that were god class. Han Sen really didn't believe it.

If God could randomly start geno being scroll fights, then why, in the past and across all of time, had nothing like this happened before?

"As a god, never lying is one of the most basic rules," God said. The being reached out a hand and brought a notebook out of nowhere. Then, God started writing in it.

Han Sen leaned his head over to take a gander at what was being written, but he noticed the paper in the notebook was blank. The pen was not writing down anything.

While Han Sen was confused over what God hoped to do, he suddenly heard the thunder roll through space.

Suddenly, the entire universe went dark. Every creature in the entire universe was shocked. The sky was pitch-black. One could not even see their fingers. Suddenly, a big boom sounded. He didn't know what was happening.

Some low-life creatures that had not developed were madly running around. They did not know what was happening. They thought it was the end of the world.

Suddenly, there was a crack in space. An ancient temple appeared. It looked like the geno hall. It inched its way out of the crack.

"What is happening? Why has the geno hall suddenly appeared now? Did another god just die? But no way! I did not see another god's sadness."

"Did someone trigger a lantern fight?"

"I don't think so. I do not see anyone triggering a lantern fight for ownership of a race lantern."

Many deified elites across several different races were confused. They were looking at the geno hall, which was floating in space.

This time, when the geno hall appeared, it was different from how it usually appeared. When the geno hall revealed itself completely, the gate slowly opened.

The light inside the gates was very bright. People could only see bright, godly lights manifest from beyond the gate. One could not really see what was inside the god hall.

Inside that very bright godly light, something came out from the god hall. When everyone clearly saw what it was, they were knocked into shock. It was a scroll.

"Is that the geno being scroll? It does not quite look the same. The geno being scroll fights happened a few years ago. Why is it happening again so soon?"

"What is happening here?" Bai King stood atop his god tower. He frowned and looked at the scroll unfurling in the sky.

On an unknown small planet, an old man who was a fortune-teller frowned while looking at the scroll. "What the hell? Why would a geno being scroll appear now?"

Inside the palace of a red dwarf star, there was a man who looked like a king. He was looking at the scroll in the sky with interest.

Inside a black hole, the Demon alpha—who had been practicing with his eyes closed—suddenly opened them. He stared at the scroll in the sky.

At the peak of Empty Mountain, a green-haired beast and a woman looked at this weird scene unfold with shock.

The scroll slowly opened up. There was shiny text on it. No one was able to read the words, but every creature was somehow able to understand the meaning. Even the people from the undeveloped races were able to understand what the words meant.

The feeling was like someone was standing aloft in space and reading it, but no one heard the sounds.

A godly voice that could not be heard echoed throughout the universe. "The geno god list is open. All god class creatures are eligible to join. The first 100 can be kept inside the geno god list and be handsomely rewarded."

Han Sen was frozen. He could not believe that something he had randomly said could instigate universe-wide changes. When he saw the rewards, his heart jumped.

That was especially true of the reward for those in the first place. If there were a chance, Han Sen would fight for his life to claim that prize.

Han Sen thought, "I believe that prize would tempt the deified elites of the entire universe."

It was not just his heart that was jumping. Every deified elite in the entire universe was going crazy. The rest on the list did not matter much, but the first-place reward was a god's personality. They could become god spirits. That was the dream of most deified elites.

Unfortunately, entering the geno hall was too hard. Approximately 99% of true gods died while attempting to go in. No one dared to try to go in on a whim.

Now, they just needed to win first place in the latest fights to become god spirits. The difficulty had been significantly reduced.

Even if people did not achieve the first place, the rewards behind it were still quite good. It made the elites who were not deified very tempted.

Boom!

Seeing the empty geno god list shine, countless amounts of starlight flew across the universe. Han Sen saw starlight come before him. It was an invitation to the geno god fight. Pretty much every deified in the universe received the same starlight.
