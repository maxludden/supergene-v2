<h2>Requiem Tree Egg</h2>
<h3>Chapter 2429</h3>

<p>“Trees make babies? Is this requiem tree a xenogeneic?” Han Sen
asked in confusion.</p>
<p>Miss Mirror shook her head. “I don’t know if the requiem tree is
a xenogeneic, but it doesn’t produce babies. The tree egg is
essentially a collection of the tree’s resin. The more energy a
requiem tree takes in, the more resin it can produce. That resin
gathers inside the tree hole to become an orb. It looks something
like an ant egg. They are called tree eggs.”</p>
<p>“I was told a story of a man who managed to get a requiem tree
egg that was around the size of a fingernail. He was only a
low-tier King, but he used the requiem tree egg’s power to advance
all the way to deified. Ever since then, requiem tree eggs have
become the most sought after treasure in the entire universe. But
the ability of requiem tree eggs to help a King class being rise to
deified is only of secondary importance. People are more interested
in them because they can be used to help deified individuals
ascend.” Miss Mirror paused and went on to say, “But considering
the battle that happened here, I’m afraid the requiem tree egg
inside the tree hole has already been taken away.”</p>
<p>“Maybe it’s still here. Let me see,” Night Wind said. Then he
launched himself into the air and flew up to the tree hole. He
hovered right in front of it, putting his eyes right near the tree
hole to peer inside.</p>
<p>“This tree hole is strange. I’m looking right into it, but I
cannot see anything inside,” Night Wind said to Miss Mirror.</p>
<p>“Requiem trees are resting trees for the Ancient God. They have
unusual powers, so not even deified elites can see what is inside
the tree hole. Luckily, requiem tree holes aren’t dangerous. Just
put your hand inside,” Miss Mirror said.</p>
<p>Night Wind hesitated, but he did as he was instructed. Just in
case, he shrouded his hand in night power that would defend against
anything evil that might have taken up residence inside the tree
hole. Then he placed his hand into the hole.</p>
<p>She said the tree hole wasn’t dangerous, but who knew if some
toxic bug had decided to make its home there or something. This
entire city felt cursed, and so by Night Wind’s reasoning, bizarre
toxic bugs weren’t out of the question.</p>
<p>Seeing Night Wind place his hand in the hole, Han Sen felt
nervous on his behalf. If there was something weird inside the tree
hole, and it pulled Night Wind inside, that would actually be kind
of scary.</p>
<p>But after Night Wind plunged his hand into the hole, a grin
crossed his face. He shouted, “There is something in here! It is
circular, and it feels like a stone. I don’t know if it is a
requiem tree egg, however.”</p>
<p>“Touch it with your hand. If it is a requiem tree egg, your hand
will smell like resin,” Miss Mirror said.</p>
<p>Night Wind touched the item and then pulled his hand out of the
hole to sniff it.</p>
<p>He didn’t actually need to bring it up to his nose. Even at the
bottom of the tree, Han Sen and Miss Mirror could smell that
pleasant, grassy fragrance. Just the smell alone was enough to make
Han Sen feel like his body was waking up after a long winter. He
felt so relaxed, it was like his cells were coming alive.</p>
<p>“Not bad! That is the smell of a requiem tree egg. I can barely
believe that the requiem tree egg is still there. Pull it out!”
Miss Mirror said.</p>
<p>Night Wind immediately reached into the hole again to pull the
tree egg out. But when he tried to draw his arms back out, they
stopped abruptly. He couldn’t seem to get the egg out.</p>
<p>“The egg is too big! I can’t get it to fit through the hole,”
Night Wind said. He pulled out his sword of darkness to slash the
tree hole in an attempt to widen it.</p>
<p>But when the sword of darkness hit the bark of the tree, it only
left a small white scratch mark behind. There wasn’t the faintest
semblance of a firm dent.</p>
<p>“Trying to cut it is useless! The requiem tree is the resting
place of many members of the Ancient God. Even a tiny requiem tree
is impervious to most powers and gear, and this tree is enormous,”
Miss Mirror said.</p>
<p>“Can he not crack the egg into pieces and bring them out like
that?” Han Sen said.</p>
<p>“The egg will be harder than the requiem tree itself. How is he
supposed to break it?” Miss Mirror rolled her eyes at Han Sen. Then
she turned to Night Wind again. “How big is the tree egg?”</p>
<p>“Very big…” Night Wind said, his voice strangely distracted.</p>
<p>“How big is very big? Big like a brain?” Han Sen asked with a
laugh.</p>
<p>A fingernail-sized requiem tree egg turned a King into a
deified. If there was a brain-sized requiem tree egg, it would
probably start a war that would consume the entire universe.</p>
<p>“If your brain is one meter across, then yes, it is sized like
your brain,” Night Wind said quietly. Han Sen noticed that the
man’s eyes were very wide.</p>
<p>“What? That large?” Han Sen asked hoarsely. His eyes almost
popped out of his skull. He could scarcely believe how big that
was.</p>
<p>“Are you sure that is a requiem tree egg and not something
else?” Miss Mirror asked with shock. Not even she could believe
it.</p>
<p>No one had ever heard of such a giant requiem tree egg before.
Even small eggs were considered priceless relics among deified
elites, but this…</p>
<p>The thought of a one-meter long requiem tree egg was enough to
make people’s blood boil and their hearts leap in their chests. The
power of something like that was beyond imagining.</p>
<p>“I don’t know. You should confirm it yourself, Miss Mirror.”
Night Wind came down from the tree hole. He still looked somewhat
shell-shocked as he spoke to Miss Mirror.</p>
<p>It was weird to see such an expression on Night Wind’s face. But
when seeing a requiem egg such as that, even a deified was bound to
have difficulty managing their excitement.</p>
<p>A requiem tree egg could strengthen deifieds. A requiem tree egg
the size of a plum could increase a deified’s level by quite a bit.
If a deified refined a tree egg of this magnitude, they could
easily become a god spirit.</p>
<p>Miss Mirror flew up to the tree hole. She put her hand in and
began feeling around the tree hole. Seconds later, her jaw hung
slack in wonder.</p>
<p>“It really is a requiem tree egg. I cannot believe that such a
large egg exists.” Miss Mirror finally said after ten minutes of
fiddling. Her expression said that she wasn’t entirely sure how she
should feel.</p>
<p>“It really is a requiem tree egg,” Han Sen and Night Wind said
together.</p>
<p>“Yes, and it is also circular. It is somewhere between a meter
and two meters across.” Miss Mirror couldn’t help but sigh. “It is
a shame that the tree hole is only the size of a fist. If it was a
small requiem tree egg, we could take it out. Now we know that
there is a tree egg inside and that it is something that would
change the universe as we know it. However, we don’t have a way to
remove it.”</p>
<p>“Wait! Maybe there’s a way to get it out.” Night Wind suddenly
sounded exhilarated.</p>
<p>“What? You have a way to expand the tree hole?” Han Sen looked
at Night Wind. Miss Mirror looked at him as well, a single eyebrow
raised.</p>
<p>Instead of answering, Night Wind used his finger to point at the
tree excitedly, and spoke, “Look over there.”</p>
<p>Han Sen and Miss Mirror followed his finger. A deep scar ran
across one side of the tree. It was a three-foot-long gash, and it
was three fingers deep, at least.</p>
<p>“That is a sword mark.” Han Sen’s eyes brightened.</p>
<p>The sword mark was old, and even though the tree had healed,
there was a scar. But based on the angle of the scar, it looked as
if it had been delivered by the big sword they had found
earlier.</p>
