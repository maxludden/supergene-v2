<p>“Who are you people? How dare you come to the Feng family! Are
you not afraid of the Qin Kingdom’s law?” Feng Fei Fei was
protecting Feng Yin Yin and Bao’er as she shouted at Rocky Dee.</p>
<p>“Beautiful lady, if this was a normal day, I could spend all day
discussing the law and other knowledgeable things with you. Alas,
today is not a normal day. I have come here for her. Therefore, I
am sorry.” Rocky Dee used his cane to point at Bao’er.</p>
<p>Feng Yin Yin protected Bao’er, but the dragon maid stared at
her. A scary sort of power suddenly whelmed and suppressed her. It
affected Feng Fei Fei too. She and Feng Yin Yin were pinned to the
ground and unable to move.</p>
<p>Boom!</p>
<p>Fire blazed as a small white fish appeared in front of them. The
power of the dragon maid vanished. It was like her power had been
burned to a crisp by the fire.</p>
<p>“You can play with the small fish,” Rocky Dee coldly said.</p>
<p>The dragon maid nodded. Her body expanded, tearing the black
maid outfit she was wearing. She turned into a black dragon
standing on all fours. Everyone in the Feng family’s castle
trembled as the dragon’s breath came bearing down on the little
flying fish.</p>
<p>The small flying fish spewed white fire that struck the big
black dragon’s dragon breath. It created a scene in which neither
of the two could win. One white and one black, two different fires,
collided and erased each other out.</p>
<p>Rocky Dee circled the battleground and walked toward Bao’er at
the back. His face had a gentleman’s smile as he said, “You are a
cute little princess. You should not be afraid. Uncle is going to
take you to a beautiful castle where you will be a privileged guest
there.”</p>
<p>“Really?” Bao’er asked with a weird blink.</p>
<p>“Bao’er, do not trust that man. He is a bad guy.” Feng Yin Yin
grabbed Bao’er and retreated.</p>
<p>“I am not exactly a bad guy,” Rocky Dee said with a smile as he
started walking toward Bao’er. “That is because I am not human. I
am a god. You can call me a bad god or an evil god. One of those
two will work. My name is Rocky Dee, and my god title is Paper
God.”</p>
<p>“Let’s go.” Feng Fei Fei tried her best to protect them. She
wanted to run away with them.</p>
<p>Rocky Dee waved his hands. Two paper pieces flew out of his
hands. One of his hands looked like it was a crane holding a cold
blade. The two sheets of paper were suddenly cut into two paper
persons.</p>
<p>The two paper men stood up. According to their actions, Feng Fei
Fei and Feng Yin Yin no longer had control of their bodies. They
behaved as the paper men did. Unable to do anything about it, they
let go of Bao’er and walked to the side.</p>
<p>“Do not worry, you two beautiful ladies,” Rocky Dee said with a
smile. “I am an honorable God Spirit. I wouldn’t dare dream of
killing a woman. “He walked past both of them and approached
Bao’er.</p>
<p>“Beautiful little princess, do you want to come to my castle as
an esteemed guest?” Rocky Dee lowered his body to perform a
gracious gesture.</p>
<p>“OK,” Bao’er laughed and said with a nod. She put a small hand
in Rocky Dee’s hand.</p>
<p>Rocky Dee smiled, but Feng Fei Fei and Feng Yin Yin looked as if
they were in a desperate rush. Unfortunately, they could not move
or speak. They had to watch Bao’er be taken by Rocky Dee to the
castle’s door.</p>
<p>“Let go of Lady Bao’er.” A calm voice sounded from in the
castle.</p>
<p>Rocky Dee looked back. He saw a middle-aged man holding a tea
set going toward them. Judging from his clothing, one was able to
tell that he must have been a servant at the castle.</p>
<p>When Rocky Dee saw that person, his eyes froze. He looked at the
middle-aged man and called out his name. He did so slowly and word
by word.</p>
<p>“Jian… Bu… Gu…”</p>
<p>“Please let Miss Bao’er go.” Jian Bu Gu stepped forward with an
expression that did not change.</p>
<p>Rocky Dee was holding Bao’er by the hand. He did not let her go.
He smiled and said, “Jian Bu Gu, the oath you made has yet to see
you released. So, what? Are you really going to stop me by fighting
me? Are you going to break your oath? Or, are you just going to do
nothing and watch me walk away?”</p>
<p>Jian Bu Gu coldly said, “I did make an oath. Of course, I will
not break it.”</p>
<p>“What is the point of you stepping forward now?” Rocky Dee asked
with a lift of his lips. “So, what? Does it matter that you are
Jian Bu Gu? A Jian Bu Gu that cannot wield a sword is no better
than a gutter rat.”</p>
<p>Jian Bu Gu did not answer. He walked toward Bao’er. He put the
tea set in front of Bao’er and said, “Miss Bao’er, this is a gift
for you.”</p>
<p>Rocky Dee was scared of Jian Bu Gu, but he did not do anything.
He looked at what was on the tea set.</p>
<p>It was a sword. It was a short sword made of wood. It was only
one foot long and looked like a toy for children.</p>
<p>Rocky Dee and the others could tell the wooden sword was not a
gene race or a sacrifice. It was like an ordinary decoration that
had been made from wood.</p>
<p>“What is this?” Bao’er picked up the sword and asked with
curiosity.</p>
<p>“This is a wooden sword I always carry around with me,” Jian Bu
Gu said. “My father made it for me when I was young. It was a
birthday gift.”</p>
<p>“This is so important. I cannot take this from you.” Bao’er
shook her head. She wanted to return it to Jian Bu Gu.</p>
<p>Jian Bu Gu put away the tea set and smiled. “Do not worry about
it, Miss Bao’er. My father was just an ordinary man who did not
have a God Spirit Blood-Pulse. It did not matter what type of wood
or the craftsmanship, the wooden sword he made for me is just a
common thing. Please, do not think of it as useless. Take it.”</p>
<p>“I love this gift,” Bao’er said as she held the wooden
sword.</p>
<p>Rocky Dee looked at the wooden sword and coldly asked, “Jian Bu
Gu, do you think that wooden sword is going to stop me?”</p>
<p>He could not tell what was so amazing about that wooden sword.
It was just as Jian Bu Gu said. It was an ordinary wooden sword
with nothing remarkable about it. The material and craftsmanship
were decidedly average. It seemed that if he wanted to, he could
crush it with ease.</p>
<p>“No.” Jian Bu shook his head and said nothing more. He walked
away with the tea set in his hands, making no effort to stop Rocky
Dee.</p>
<p>Rocky Dee looked weird. After watching Jian Bu Gu return to the
garden, he turned his gaze back to Bao’er’s new wooden sword. There
was nothing special or powerful about it.</p>
<p>“Princess Bao’er, let’s go.” Rocky Dee was confused. If Jian Bu
Gu was not going to fight, then he did not worry. He did not think
a wooden sword could do anything much to him.</p>
<p>Bao’er nodded and said to Feng Fei Fei and Feng Yin Yin, “Sister
Fei Fei and Sister Yin Yin, I will go to his home to play. I will
be right back.”</p>
<p>Feng Fei Fei and Feng Yin Yin were worried, but they could not
move or speak. They could only watch Bao’er hold Rocky Dee’s hand
and head for the castle’s gates.</p>
<p>The castle’s gates were twisted by some power. After they went
through the gates, they vanished.</p>
<p>The dragon maid still had the form of a big black dragon. She
spat out a dragon breath that shook the little fish back a bit. She
soon returned to her image of a dragon maid. After that, she fled
through the castle’s gates.</p>
<p>When the little flying fish followed, the door into space
returned to normal. The little flying fish went outside, but it
could no longer see Rocky Dee or the dragon maid.</p>
<p>Feng Fei Fei and Feng Yin Yin were given back control of their
bodies. When they ran outside of the castle, they could not see
Bao’er.</p>
