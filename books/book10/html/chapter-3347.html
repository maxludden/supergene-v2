<p>“Killed Break World beast: Gold Wing Big Bird. Found Break World
gene.”</p>
<p>In Dust Sky, without their powers to boost them, lives were very
weak. The Gold Wing Big Bird had its neck broken, and that was
enough for it to die.</p>
<p>If they had fought outside, even cutting the creature in half
would not have worked to slay the beast.</p>
<p>Han Sen turned to lie on the ground. His body was very tired
after the brawl. In a place like Dust Sky, he felt as if he had
gone to high land. He felt like a commoner, unable to adjust to the
air. He felt tired.</p>
<p>After resting for a while, Han Sen started to pick up the body
of the Gold Wing Big Bird. He dug into its body and pulled out the
Break World gene.</p>
<p>It was a tear-shaped, gold crystal. It looked beautiful. Han Sen
did not hesitate. He swallowed the Break World gene. He suddenly
felt an amazing power surge through his body. It wiped away his
tiredness. His body felt alive and vibrant again.</p>
<p>“Break World genes plus 10.”</p>
<p>An announcement sounded in his brain. The Gold Wing Big Bird was
special. It had given him ten break world genes.</p>
<p>He chopped some wood out and cut the thighs of the Gold Wing Big
Bird. He cleaned it and cooked it. The flesh would not give him
Break World genes, but it still tasted good. The Gold Wing Big Bird
was a Break World beast with a high Break World rate. It was more
of a benefit than ever.</p>
<p>Fortunately, this was Dusk Sky. Otherwise, cooking the meat of
the Gold Wing Big Bird would have been difficult. Being there made
Han Sen realize that his life was a brittle thing.</p>
<p>“How can this body leave Dust Sky? To stay here, Bury Path God
is sure to find me. If that happens, I am definitely going to be
killed.” Han Sen looked into the campfire and thought things
over.</p>
<p>After a while, Han Sen raised his head. He wanted to see if the
Gold Wing Big Bird’s leg was cooked. He needed to see if he needed
to turn it over and cook it some more.</p>
<p>When he had a look, he froze.</p>
<p>The fire he had been cooking with had no food cooking. All he
seemed to be cooking was a bone. Only a few scraps of meat remained
to the bone, which stopped it from falling.</p>
<p>Han Sen felt a chill. It was so close to him, yet something had
quietly eaten the thigh meat he had been cooking. If that thing
wanted to eat his neck, Han Sen did not know what might happen.</p>
<p>Han Sen looked around. He did not see any creatures around.
There was nothing but pitch-black darkness all around the dark
forest he was in. Han Sen was just a commoner now, so he could not
see too far. He could not discern what was lurking in the
woods.</p>
<p>He gnashed his teeth and chopped the next thigh off the other
wing of the Gold Wing Big Bird. He placed it above the fire and
resumed cooking. The forest around that place was dangerous, so
venturing into it was ill-advised. He wanted to put more meat on
the fire to see if he could draw the creature out. If he did that
and snared it, it would increase his chances of winning a
fight.</p>
<p>Fighting enemies was better than fighting sneaky enemies.</p>
<p>He put it to the fire to cook. This time, he stopped thinking
about other stuff. All he did was stare at the bird’s leg. He
wanted to see what ate his last thigh.</p>
<p>While the fire was up, the bird’s leg soon started to smell
nice. The oil sizzled as droplets began to roll off the skin like
honey. The smell and color were very enticing.</p>
<p>Han Sen remained on alert. He looked all around. Aside from the
“sha-sha” noise of the blowing breeze and the birds screaming
through the night, there was nothing else.</p>
<p>“Is that thing afraid of being seen? Is that why it is no longer
coming out?” Han Sen thought of that and felt safer.</p>
<p>If that thing felt fear, it would not be a beast that was too
scary. To him, it was pretty good news.</p>
<p>After that pause, Han Sen sat back a little. Just like earlier,
he lowered his head and pretended to think. From the corner of his
eyes, he kept his attention on the thigh.</p>
<p>The thigh, by this point, was being cooked very well. It smelled
delicious, so it was almost done. Despite that, nothing showed
up.</p>
<p>“Is that thing already full after eating a thigh?” Han Sen did
not think that was possible. He then felt as if his clothes were
being ruffled behind him.</p>
<p>Han Sen felt a chill. He shivered. He quickly turned around.
When he turned around, he didn’t see anything. It was empty. In the
distance behind him, around 90 to 120 feet away from his position,
Han Sen sensed that there was nothing.</p>
<p>Han Sen looked back at the fire and the meat that was cooking,
but his face made a ghastly wince. The cooked thigh had been eaten.
There were only the scraps of a thigh bone hanging.</p>
<p>There was nothing else around that place. There was not even a
shadow.</p>
<p>“What is this? This is Dust Sky. Aside from Bury Path God, other
creatures should be subject to the rules of this world. They should
not be able to use powers. Can ordinary creatures be that fast?
Even with my full attention on the thigh, it was taken.” Han Sen
could not believe it.</p>
<p>His body was powerful. It was the greatest in the universe. If
someone at the same level was suppressed, not many people could be
faster than him.</p>
<p>“That thing can obviously kill me if it wants to, so why doesn’t
it? He just wants to eat the thigh. Is he not interested in me?
Does he really only want the thigh? Does it actually want to play
with me? Does it want a game of cat and mouse?” Han Sen was frozen.
He frowned. He surveyed the area, but there was nothing to be
found.</p>
<p>The fact that the night was so quiet made people feel pressure.
The forest around was like an abyssal hell. It was very dark. One
did not know what scary monsters might be lurking in wait.</p>
<p>As a normal person, that mental pressure would likely break
their hearts. Han Sen fetched some more bird meat and went back to
cooking it.</p>
<p>This time, he did not want to lure that creature out. He
collected the meat the moment it was done. He was going to eat
it.</p>
<p>He suddenly saw a cold light flicker. It swiftly flashed near
Han Sen’s mouth. The bird meat in Han Sen’s hand flew away. Han
Sen’s teeth sank into nothing.</p>
