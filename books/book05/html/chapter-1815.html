<h2>Maxing Out Genes</h2>
<h3>Chapter 1815</h3>

<p>“Xenogeneic Gene Consumed: Baron Geno Point +1”</p>
<p>Han Sen cooked a few of the bananas over a fire. As they cooked,
the bananas quickly softened from their previous crystallike state.
Each banana increased one Baron gene. Before he had finished eating
them all, he reached one hundred Baron genes.</p>
<p>“Baron geno points at max. Point collection can no longer
continue. The geno body requires a special fruit”</p>
<p>Han Sen ate another banana, and the same announcement
played.</p>
<p>In the sanctuaries, when your geno points maxed out, you could
evolve via the evolution pools. In the geno universe, things didn’t
behave like that. He had no clue how to break through and
ascend.</p>
<p>“Does this mean I have to initiate the breakthrough myself?” Han
Sen kept thinking, but this was the only possibility that came to
mind.</p>
<p>It was pointless to keep eating the same geno fruit, so he
packed it up and went back to the sanctuary.</p>
<p>When Xie Qing King saw Han Sen, he ran up to him, pounding his
puffed-up chest.</p>
<p>“Old Han, I can generate geno armor. Take me to the geno
universe and I will use my handsome body and awesome comics to
conquer that place.”</p>
<p>“Me, too,” Little Angel said calmly.</p>
<p>“Me, too,” came Zero’s soft voice.</p>
<p>“Me, too. Me, too.” Many people kept saying they were done and
ready to go. If Luolan and Ji Yanran reached that level, they’d
probably want to go, as well. Especially so, with the prospect of
searching for Littleflower.</p>
<p>“Stop! Stop! What do you guys think that place is? It’s not like
moving to a new house. You might die out there. At least give me
some more time to prepare a nice, safe place for you to settle
into. Little Silver, you can ascend and come to the geno universe,
too.”</p>
<p>Han Sen went back to Planet Kate, now having to think about a
serious matter.</p>
<p>Because he had brought back many xenogeneic genes, many of his
people could generate their geno armor. A lot of them were dying to
come, and he knew it’d be impossible to stop them forever.</p>
<p>This was especially true for Xie Qing King and Gu Qincheng. They
would undoubtedly try something stupid if Han Sen did not bring
them soon.</p>
<p>“I need to find a safe place to build a base for us. If I do
that, they can come. But where can I find such a safe place?” Han
Sen took Little Invisible toward one of the nearby cities. After
two days of travel, they reached it.</p>
<p>Little Invisible was the chameleon’s new name. The creature
seemed happy with it.</p>
<p>Fortunately, there was no fighting going on in that city. It was
still under the full control of the people of Kate. There, Han Sen
was able to buy a phone with which he could contact Qiao and Lan
Se.</p>
<p>Qiao told Han Sen that Gran City had fallen and that they had
joined Seven Mirrors. They were on a ship headed there. She told
Han Sen to come to her, because he could join the land reclamation
operations instead of just fighting all the time.</p>
<p>Han Sen thought the idea wasn’t too bad. If he could find a
place without higher races running around and hunting down
xenogeneics, that would be perfect for his companions to get their
foot in the door and grow.</p>
<p>But the city he was in did not have a ship heading for Seven
Mirrors. He couldn’t go.</p>
<p>On the streets of Mississippi City, everyone was hurriedly
minding their own business. No one really concerned themselves with
others. The place hadn’t been invaded by the Taurus yet, but the
people knew that it was only a matter of time before it
happened.</p>
<p>Planet Kate was in freefall, and everyone had to think about
where their future would lead and what they could do. Many ships
there were still transporting refugees into space.</p>
<p>The crowds were huge, and they could not all fit. Most of them
would have to wait for some time before they could make it off the
planet</p>
<p>On that miserable street, there was someone who didn’t quite
look like the rest of those dreary people. The man was walking down
the street without armor. He wore clothing made of real cloth, and
he also held a small banner in his hands.</p>
<p>There were some strange words written across it, but it was not
of a common language. Han Sen, however, would have recognized them
if he had seen them.</p>
<p>While the man was walking, a tall woman with white bunny ears
approached him. She was wearing a mask. She pulled out a knife and
placed the blade against the man’s neck.</p>
<p>People continued walking by, and the man and woman were suddenly
covered by a strange power. It isolated them on the busy street,
making it seem like they weren’t there at all.</p>
<p>“My Queen! What do you want?” The man was not afraid of having a
drawn knife against his neck. He looked at the woman with surprise,
though.</p>
<p>That woman was the Knife Queen of the Rebate. It was Yisha, whom
Han Sen had almost killed.</p>
<p>Yisha looked at the man with cold eyes and said, “Do you want to
live? Or do you want to die?”</p>
<p>“I haven’t lived enough, so yeah! I want to live.” The man
laughed.</p>
<p>“If you want to live, give me a reading,” Yisha said coldly.</p>
<p>The man looked at Yisha, smiled, and said, “My Queen, might I
ask if my previous prediction was accurate?”</p>
<p>“Huh.” Yisha hummed and did not answer the man. She went on to
say, “Predict my future and that of the man named Dollar. He who is
a human.”</p>
<p>Yisha had been waiting outside Demon Grave for a very long time.
Even after a storm started on the inside, Dollar still hadn’t come
to the exit point.</p>
<p>She did not believe Dollar would find himself trapped in Demon
Grave for any long stretch of time, but she had tried everything in
search of him. She just couldn’t locate the man. So, she had come
here to ask the man for help in finding the elusive Dollar.</p>
<p>“You will meet him when fate decides your paths will intertwine.
For now, you should let it go.” The man smiled.</p>
<p>“I don’t believe that. Find him for me, unless you want to die!”
Yisha said angrily.</p>
<p>The man gave a wry smile as he shook his head. “My Queen, you
are being stubborn. If you do not believe in fates, then why do you
wish to hear what I can predict?”</p>
<p>Yisha frowned. She did not want to believe what the man was
telling her, but she had already received a reading from him before
she went to Demon Grave. The reading had turned out to be truthful,
so she felt strangely compelled by what he told her.</p>
<p>Although she did not want to believe that this man could foresee
the future and perceives destinies, she did.</p>
<p>“I am asking you if you’ll do it or not” Yisha coldly looked at
him, with the knife still raised to his neck.</p>
<p>“Of course. But you cannot challenge fate. Even if I did know
where he was, you couldn’t meet him. And then you would blame me
for not being accurate.” The man sighed.</p>
<p>“Are you saying you won’t do it?” Yisha looked as if she was
ready to slash.</p>
<p>“You can’t challenge fate. You cannot force me. Everyone here
has their own destiny. Their lives are small, but not even God can
change the roads they follow. They cannot be made a queen like you.
But I am just a clairvoyant,” the man said.</p>
<p>“Who says you cannot challenge and change fate? If I wanted to,
I could make even an ant into a giant beast,” Yisha said
coldly.</p>
<p>The man smiled and said, “If you have such confidence… How about
we make a bet?”</p>
