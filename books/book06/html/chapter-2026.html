<h2>Strange Scary Bug</h2>
<h3>Chapter 2026</h3>

<p>Han Sen’s body was hampered by both the Sky Heart Locks and the
Ancient God space itself. His speed was very slow, but fortunately,
his rabbit shoes weren’t affected. He could still move with the
speed of a Duke.</p>
<p>The moment he dodged the silver light, a gold ant pattern
appeared on Han Sen’s body. It increased his power. He slashed
towards the silver, glass-like bug.</p>
<p>Dong!</p>
<p>The knife and sword powers came against the silver glass bug. A
transparent silver light appeared. Han Sen’s attack did not break
the light at all.</p>
<p>Han Sen was shocked. His body was like an ordinary Marquise, and
he had the Ant King mark’s buff. It shouldn’t have been difficult
for him to bring down a Marquise. But his full-strength strike was
unable to break the silver glass bug’s armor. It was a scary thing
to comprehend.</p>
<p>Han Sen used the rabbit shoes and their speed to fight with the
silver glass bug. He kept striking its shielding aura, but nothing
seemed to work. The aura was far too tough, and not even his knife
and sword powers could break through it.</p>
<p>Han Sen was at a very bad disadvantage.</p>
<p>Han Sen’s speed was aided by the rabbit shoes, but Sky Heart
Lock and Ancient God’s hampering were still in play. Under the
pressure of this tough of a fight, he was starting to feel tired.
His body was sore, and he felt awful.</p>
<p>“This cannot continue.” Han Sen wanted to leave, and as he made
the decision, he noticed Hai’er was already long gone.</p>
<p>The silver glass bug was not slow at all. It kept chasing after
Han Sen, spitting out silver light.</p>
<p>Han Sen clenched his jaw and ran towards the waterfall cave.
That was the only way to go back, and there was no place he could
hide. He would rather take his chances in a wider space.</p>
<p>The silver glass bug was flying. And so Han Sen flew like a
phoenix to swoop around and strike its back while airborne. But the
knife and sword power still couldn’t break the silver armor.</p>
<p>This was the first time Han Sen had encountered a xenogeneic
with extremely high defense. Han Sen believed it had to be a mutant
Marquise xenogeneic that was simply aligned with defensive
attributes.</p>
<p>Han Sen continued to fight, retreating all the while. He ran
into the belly button of the silver statue. If he was going to run
off, he was not going to run off empty-handed. He wanted to find
the statue’s Beginning of Ancient God. He could not kill the bug,
but he still thought that the Beginning of Ancient God might be up
for grabs.</p>
<p>Luckily, the statue had many different paths to take. So, Han
Sen used the unique geography to kite the silver glass bug around.
It made things better, but it also cost Han Sen a lot of power. He
was getting slower and slower as time went by.</p>
<p>Since there were no other people around, Han Sen summoned his
Dongxuan Armor. The Dongxuan Armor started absorbing the energy in
the atmosphere to keep Han Sen fueled up. That way, he could keep
on fighting and not wind up failing due to exhaustion.</p>
<p>It looked like the xenogeneic silver beetles he had encountered
earlier were all there were. After he killed the ones on the
outside, there were no more to be discovered on the inside of the
cave.</p>
<p>Han Sen kept heading down the same tunnel, and two hours later,
he found the Beginning of Ancient God embedded in a wall. It was a
silver metal slab with an irregular, haphazard shape. There was a
trilobite symbol on it, though, flashing with a silver light.</p>
<p>Han Sen was pleased to have found it, and he ran over to it and
pried it free.</p>
<p>The silver glass bug was furious, and its desire to kill Han Sen
was even greater now.</p>
<p>A bug and a human were fighting inside that cave. Han Sen could
not break its armor, and he was hit by the silver light a few
times. The Dongxuan Armor was also slashed open in a place or
two.</p>
<p>Han Sen planned to wait until the silver glass bug had exhausted
all its power. Perhaps by then, its aura would weaken too. But
after fighting for ten hours, Han Sen felt ready to fall apart. The
aura of the silver glass bug, however, was still the same.</p>
<p>It was too late for Han Sen’s body to dodge the next strike. The
silver glass bug’s silver light pierced through him.</p>
<p>Han Sen’s body exploded like a water balloon. It was just a
clone he had generated with Moon, though.</p>
<p>And while the bug was distracted with the Moon, Han Sen took off
running down a smaller passage. He used the Dongxuan Sutra to hide
his presence, and then he stopped moving.</p>
<p>The silver glass bug was flying angrily around the cave, making
horrible screeching sounds.</p>
<p>After a while, the silver glass bug flew away from the cave.
When it did, Han Sen emerged and started making his way back out
from the way he had come.</p>
<p>The silver glass bug was too strong; especially its silver
armor. Unless he used Super Spank, he didn’t think he could break
it.</p>
<p>Super Spank’s power might have broken the armor, but it also
might destroy the body completely. That would rob him of potential
gains. If he wouldn’t receive any benefits, Han Sen wasn’t going to
bother.</p>
<p>Han Sen came out of the crevice, and he found Hai’er standing
just outside. Han Sen switched to his Spell armor.</p>
<p>“You run fast.” Han Sen looked at Hai’er and smiled.</p>
<p>Hai’er smiled and said, “I am just a Pirate. I am not good at
anything else. I run fast to secure survival. I had faith in you,
though. I knew you would come back alive.”</p>
<p>Han Sen sat on the floor. He was really tired. The weight of the
Sky Heart Locks and Ancient God space’s force had hindered him
quite a bit, and he was ten times more tired than he should have
been. He had almost exhausted his entire reserve of energy, just to
make it out.</p>
<p>“Where do we go next?” Hai’er asked Han Sen, sitting opposite
him.</p>
<p>“I think our co-operation ends here. After this, we will go our
separate ways and have no further engagement,” Han Sen said.</p>
<p>“You are too cruel! We have defied death together.”</p>
<p>“Hang on, you just left me to die. Don’t try to butter it up,”
Han Sen exclaimed, stopping her.</p>
<p>Hai’er rolled her eyes and said, “How about I hire you to hunt
xenogeneics, then?”</p>
<p>“I am not interested.” Han Sen lay down on the floor and closed
his eyes. Sweat was dripping from him and his muscles were all
sore.</p>
<p>“Someone is here,” Hai’er said suddenly.</p>
<p>Han Sen sat up, and he looked in the direction that Hai’er was
indicating. A few people were coming, but their faces could not be
seen clearly. A bald head in their midst did stand out,
however.</p>
<p>“Buddha!” Han Sen was shocked.</p>
<p>“Run! I will see you again.” Hai’er turned around and ran,
forgetting all about her pleas for co-operation.</p>
<p>“She really is good at running.” He felt poorly. He wanted to
leave, as well, but he was far too tired. He would rather preserve
his energy for a fight than run off.</p>
