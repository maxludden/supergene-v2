  “Alu-Alu-Alu!”

The insane storm of punches was difficult to comprehend. Xie Qing King’s eyes gleamed with a fiery silver. The silver punches he threw were indestructible. Odoga had a snowflake’s chance in trying to repel those wild hits headed his way.

Odoga waved his six arms to protect himself as light, dark, and chaos powers worked together in an attempt to devastate Xie Qing King.

But the raging Xie Qing King cared little for what his opponent was attempting to do. His fists were the ones in control now, and there was only one thing they wanted to do: attack. He wanted to pulverize Odoga, to pound him so hard that he’d be indistinguishable from the mud of the ground. Ignoring Odoga’s attack, he went forward and allowed himself to be hit.

Xie Qing King and Odoga were both fully committed to the assault, though. The cruelest and bloodiest fight of the Geno Being Scroll was only just beginning.

Odoga’s six fists, with scary powers, came raging at Xie Qing King. And as this occurred, Xie Qing King used his own power to repeatedly pummel Odoga.

Armor was broken, flesh was tom, blood was spraying; the two of them were using the most primal and primitive methods to fight with each other.

Odoga’s six fists had the advantage, unfortunately. But this did not at all mean that Xie Qing King, who only had a natural pair of fists, was weak. And the more damage he incurred, the stronger he became.

His fists moved like lightning, and the shadows they cast were of spilling blood and breaking bone.

Odoga raged and screamed at his unrelenting opponent. His body was severely wounded by the wrath of his nemesis, and he couldn’t help but let out a shout due to the insufferable pain.

Both of them were accumulating wounds. Blood sprayed through the air like flower petals, but neither showed a sign of backing off. Their repeated strikes only looked to be getting crazier and crazier.

“Oh God! This is no longer a competition. This is a bloodbath!”

This is far too cruel. This is far too violent.”

“Ha… Ha… This is what a real fight should be like. Oh, I love this!”

“This is rather interesting, I must confess. It’s more satisfying to watch such a raw fight.”

“F*ck yeah! Kill him. Go on!”

The audience was ravenous for more. The violence of the fight drew an insatiable bloodlust from them, driving their excitement The adrenaline levels of the audience were through the roof.

Pang!

Odoga and Xie Qing King flew away from each other. One of them crashed into a mountainside, whereas the other dropped into an open field.

They were both severely injured. Odoga’s six arms had all been broken. Some of them had been tom off completely, whereas others hung on by the thread of their tendons. Only two were still completely attached, but even they were sorely injured.

The three faces were swollen and distended, and one eye had been squelched. Blood was soaking the Earl’s entire form.

Xie Qing King was not faring much better than his foe. His legs had been broken, his right shoulder had been dislocated, both of his eyes had been shattered, and all of his ribs had been snapped or cracked. With the amount of blood soaking him, there was only one thing you could call him: a blood man.

But Xie Qing King’s lifeforce, despite all that, was none the weaker. In fact, its glow had increased. He picked himself up from the soil pit and shone with a silver light. That light enveloped his entire body like a hungry fire.

Odoga looked gloomy, by comparison. After lifting himself up on the field, he generated a power. Light and dark energies gathered at the knuckles of his fists, giving each of them a swirling mixture of black and white lights.

As Odoga’s power increased, the black and white powers were like taichi. A strange power was keeping them both in perfect balance.

Seeing Odoga and Xie Qing King collecting their strength, the audience knew that whatever was next would be it. Their final strikes were coming.

With the condition the two of them were in, generating that much power meant that it had to be the final attack.

You are strong, but you are still weaker than me. You may concede now, if you want to live.” Odoga’s fist, channeling all that energy, was reaching max capacity as he spoke.

The scary powers made everything around him vibrate. The dimension of the space he occupied seemed to distort and twist under the black and white powers he carried.

“I am sorry, but I am afraid that I do not know what you are getting at. My vocabulary seems to be lacking a few words, and I think what you’ve just said may be among the missing ones.” Blood streamed from Xie Qing King’s eyes. He had a strange smile, and a silver flame propelled him forward.

“Light, dark, and chaos. Together, they are the most stable elements one could ever hope to possess. They combine together to create the Destroyed Light. It is the most powerful godlight in the entire geno universe. When this strike falls upon you, you will be nothing more than a memory. I like you, truth be told, and I would favor the prospect of allowing you to live and not killing you. Furthermore, if you pledge to join the Destroyed, I will allow you to win,” Odoga slowly said.

“The only way I can allow myself to win is if I annihilate every enemy that stands in my way. Show me everything you’ve got. Don’t hold back, and come and fight me,” Xie Qing King said. His silver flame was like the final swell of a volcano ready to erupt.

“If you want to die, then so be it.” Odoga’s power exploded. The attack his fist unleashed came soaring over to Xie Qing King.

Black and white powers blended together. It looked as if it could obliterate anything in its path as it headed toward Xie Qing King. Everything that came into contact with that swirling power would likely be destroyed.

Just the shockwave of that power was enough to tear up the land for miles around and sunder the skies into ruin.

“The last Xie Qing cannon.” The armor on Xie Qing King’s body shattered under the swelling of his own power. He stood upon the battlefield with his upper body naked, bearing an evil grin. His eyes were bleeding, and while he could not see, he could still sense the location of his opponent. His punch was unleashed, headed for the godlight possessed by the Destroyed man.

The silver fist became an orb of light. It came forward to strike the black and white powers simultaneously.

Boom!

The two scary powers collided with each other, and what resulted was akin to the detonation of a hydrogen bomb. The giant explosion looked like a sun going supernova, consuming everything in its proximity. It was too bright for anyone to actually see anything inside it, though.

When the lights finally dimmed, a giant chasm was all that remained. Inside that deep crater, one person was left standing. The other person writhed around on the ground, struggling to get up.

Xie Qing King looked at Odoga trying to get up off of the ground. Slicking back his silver hair, he coldly said, “You are strong, but you are weaker than I. And since you now seem to understand my power, I will spare your life. Go back, practice for a few hundred years, and then get back to me. Perhaps by then you will stand a 0.0001 percent chance of defeating me.”

“I’ll be back.” Odoga could not get up. He ripped up his paper and disappeared from the field of battle.

“I am invincible, no matter where I go!” Xie Qing King ran his fingers through his hair and disappeared from that corner of the dimension.

Pang!

As soon as Xie Qing King was teleported back out of the Geno Being Scroll, his injured body collapsed. The will to win and the accompanying adrenaline were the only things that had kept him going.
