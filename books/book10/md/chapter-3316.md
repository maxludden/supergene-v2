“Just because you can’t do it now does not mean you can’t do it later. Plus, you are a man. How can you say you can’t do it?” Big sky demon looked at Han Sen and smiled.

“You can’t try to provoke me. You are not going to tell me anyway.” Han Sen looked like a dead pig that was not afraid of hot water.

Big sky demon sighed. “You are so hard to deal with, but you are my little lover. Therefore, I can tell you the password. There is something you should know, however. If the password is written down on the geno tablet, the whole geno tablet will reset the 33 skies. The entirety of the 33 skies will change. All of the creatures in the 33 skies will be affected. Unless using it is an absolute must, you should think long and hard before deciding what to do with it.”

“What kind of effects are we talking about?” Han Sen asked.

Han Sen did not really care about other creatures, but he was in the 33 skies too. He might end up being affected.

“I have never tried it before.” How am I supposed to know? I will tell you the password, but it is up to you whether or not it is used. If something goes wrong, you can’t take it out on me.” Big sky demon’s words were said to shirk all responsibility.

“You don’t know? In that case, how do you know anything will be affected?” Han Sen looked at her untrustingly.

Big sky demon slumped her shoulders and said, “Mister Leader told me. He is the one who told me the password and informed me about what would happen if it was used. If you really want to know the specifics, you should consider asking the leader himself.”

“How am I supposed to know where to find your leader?” Han Sen had a wry smile.

“That is no concern of mine,” big sky demon said. She put out her finger and drew 24 symbols in the air.

“These 24 symbols are the passwords needed to unlock the geno tablet’s Return to Origin. You can put it down anywhere on the tablet. It can be in any order as well. But you must remember that the order of your writing of it cannot be changed. Otherwise, the password will not work.”

After big sky demon said that, she waved her hand to erase the 24 symbols.

It was just 24 symbols, so Han Sen was able to recognize them all with ease. The order in which he remembered them would not be wrong either. Even so, Han Sen did not dare risk believing big sky demon. Who knew if the geno password, those 24 words, would be as useful as she was claiming them to be?

“I have told you the password,” big sky demon said. “It is now up to you how you use it. My wounds have not yet recovered, so I will be requiring more rest.” She was like a nightmare entering Han Sen’s body. She then vanished.

“Did she really just leave like that?” Han Sen frowned.

People like Ancient Devil and big sky demon would not really force anyone to do anything, but most of the time, one had to do what they said anyway. That was why they were such scary people.

Han Sen was not planning on using big sky demon’s password since he did not know what would happen.

If what big sky demon had told him was true, the geno tablet would give him backlash. With Han Sen’s Super God Spirit mode and the power of The Story of Genes, he was not afraid of a gene message invading his body.

Still, it was always a good thing to harbor doubt. Plus, Han Sen did not think he required the password just yet.

Han Sen sat against the geno tablet’s bottom. He kept using geno arts to recover his power.

He waited to see if the words would fully disappear. He wanted to see if he would get backlash. Plus, if he did not keep drawing symbols on the geno tablet, Sky King might end up being able to open the holes in space again.

Time went by. As his mark started to lighten, its lights grew dimmer. Before the geno spell wholly disappeared, Han Sen understood that Ancient Devil was right.

When the geno spell’s symbols were not clear, the universe had black dots again. It was the black holes reawakening.

“This is bad. Me being fully recovered, power-wise, aligns perfectly with the time it takes for the spell to fade and my need to renew it comes. Does that mean I will be trapped here unable to do anything else?” Han Sen frowned.

That was not what he was worried about the most. Even if he wanted to keep the geno spell in place, there were still a few days he had to freely go around. He just had to come back and top up the geno spell every few days. If he did not get into a fight or spend any energy, Han Sen would be fine.

Big sky demon had mentioned something to him about a backlash. It made Han Sen nervous.

While the geno spell had not gone yet, Han Sen used his Super God Spirit mode. He drew a geno spell on the stone tablet. He then cast a geno art to recover power. He was going to accept the backlash if it came for him.

“I hope The Story of Genes’ Forever Solid power can prohibit the invasion of genes in my body,” Han Sen thought.

An hour went by. The first geno spell finally disappeared. Han Sen did not feel as if there was a gene invasion. He thought, “Was big sky demon just yanking my chain?”

While he was thinking, where Han Sen had written down the geno spell on the geno tablet spell lit up. The light was like a fairy leaping out from the tablet. It flew to Han Sen.

Han Sen gathered up power to hit the light spell, but the light spell was like something unreal. His power was unable to touch it. The light spell was very fast. It landed on Han Sen’s forehead. He had been unable to avoid it.

Han Sen was very shocked. He only required one thought to instantly travel very fast. He could go a thousand miles in the blink of an eye, yet his reactions had not been fast enough. He had a very bad feeling. He cast The Story of Genes and had his whole body run its Forever Solid power.

According to theory, Forever Solid meant one’s gene messages could not be altered. In front of that mysterious geno tablet, Han Sen was not so sure it would still apply.

The light spell landed on Han Sen’s forehead. It looked as if it melted into his skin.

Han Sen felt his entire body burn with what felt like fire. His blood started to boil.

“The backlash is real…” Han Sen felt his cells burn like steel. They were melting. A weird power was going into him. He could not describe it. It made Han Sen feel either upset or pain.
