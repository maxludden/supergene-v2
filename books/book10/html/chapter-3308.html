	<p>The nine-headed monster’s arms, which were going to hit Ning Yue and Sheep, had a sword air come out from it. An
		arm was cut off. The nine-headed monster squealed. Its broken arm bled like a fountain of bloody, red water.</p>

	<p>“I am going to kill you!” All of the nine-headed monster’s heads roared together. Nine different powers gathered
		together. Another fist deployed nine evil lights. They madly punched at Ning Yue.</p>

	<p>Ning Yue let the little green sword go. He allowed the little sword to float in front of him. He did not look at
		the scary power that came from the little green sword. A man and a sword did not move.</p>

	<p>As the nine evil lights were coming closer, Ning Yue did not move a muscle. The little green sword made a buzzing
		noise. It released a strange sword cry. It turned into a green peacock that went straight for Ning Yue.</p>

	<p><em>Boom!</em></p>

	<p>The nine evil lights detonated on Ning Yue. Everything around seemed to rise up. The nine evil lights shattered.
	</p>

	<p>Sheep was hiding behind Ning Yue. His eyes were wide open. Within the nine lights, a green color kept spreading.
		The nine god lights could not get closer.</p>

	<p>As the nine god lights faded, Ning Yue was still standing where he had been. He looked unharmed, but his body was
		adorned in beautiful, green feather clothing. He was like a proud, green peacock.</p>

	<p>Ning Yue looked into the sky. He lifted his lips to smile and said, “I am back…”</p>

	<p>“What nonsense are you talking about?” The nine-headed weird beast roared. He threw more punches at Ning Yue, one
		after another.</p>

	<p>Ning Yue calmly looked at the nine-headed monster, whose futile strikes could not accomplish anything. His
		feather clothing had many peacock feathers coming out. They turned into many green sword lights.</p>

	<p>The nine-headed monster’s nine god light came again. It was pierced by a green light. No matter how many nine god
		lights the nine-headed monster unleashed, the same results happened every time.</p>

	<p>On top of that, Ning Yue’s body was decked in more and more peacock feathers as time went by. The nine-headed
		monster was unable to stop it. A green sword light suddenly pierced through its head and broke it. That couldn’t
		be stopped either.</p>

	<p>The head immediately grew back.</p>

	<p>The nine-headed monster madly roared, “You cannot kill me! I am going to rip you apart!”</p>

	<p>After that, the nine-headed monster raised its head. It was going to jump on Ning Yue.</p>

	<p>Ning Yue squinted his eyes. The feathers on the peacock’s train were lined up straight behind him. He became a
		sky full of sword lights going for the nine-headed monster.</p>

	<p>Pang! Pang! Pang! Pang!</p>

	<p>The nine-headed monster tried its hardest to swing its fists, but there were more and more sword lights piercing
		through its body and head. Suddenly, its body and nine heads were broken.</p>

	<p>The nine-headed monster’s giant body turned into a blood mist. It did not heal itself.</p>

	<p>“Holy crap! This person, who is not a guy and not a girl, is so strong.” Sheep’s mouth was agape in awe of the
		spectacle. He could not believe Ning Yue, who was such a noble-looking peacock, was the same Ning Yue as the one
		that was always a wimp. He just couldn’t picture it. He was too used to seeing him cry all day long.</p>

	<p>“Let’s go. We now have extra big trouble.” The feathers on Ning Yue’s body had become wings. He prepared his body
		to fly up. Suddenly, he turned into a green light and disappeared into the sky.</p>

	<p>Sheep realized what was happening. He looked in Ning Yue’s direction and shouted, “Wait for me! Do not leave me!”
	</p>

	<p>A green peacock feather floated down. It scared Sheep. He thought Ning Yue was going to kill him.</p>

	<p>The peacock feather stopped near Sheep. It bent into a curve to carry Sheep up and away at a speed to break
		through space. Suddenly, he flew into the sky.</p>

	<p>Very High and Mirror Lake was host to many elites fighting for their lives, but Outer Sky had more and more Break
		World beasts showing up. They could not control it anymore.</p>

	<p>Yu Shanxin stepped forward. His feet moved like they were stepping on a lotus flower. He stepped on the back of a
		phoenix-like Break World beast. No matter how that weird bird flew, Yu Shanxin was practically attached to its
		back. The beast couldn’t shake its rider.</p>

	<p>Although Yu Shanxin could not beat the Break World beast, the Break World beast could do nothing to hurt Yu
		Shanxin.</p>

	<p>“It looks like it is my fortuitous time as the silkworm is now done,” Yu Shanxin said with a sigh.</p>

	<p>He felt as if chains had been unlocked within his body. It made Yu Shanxin’s body harder to touch. He followed
		the phoenix-like Break World beast that was flying in the sky.</p>

	<p>In the seven kingdoms, there were many Break World beasts. The number of Break World beasts was less than the
		number invading the geno universe. Even so, the seven kingdoms were incurring significant damage.</p>

	<p>Fortunately, the seven kingdoms had Break World elites to safeguard their realms. Furthermore, they believed in
		God Spirits. They had the protection of the God Spirits. Things there were not as bad as they were in the geno
		universe. The fights were not so devastating.</p>

	<p>Han Sen had initially planned on flying back to the Space Garden, but he didn’t move. Ancient Devil suddenly
		arrived before him.</p>

	<p>“Han Sen, are you interested in going to the 33 skies?” Ancient Devil knew Han Sen was there, which was why he
		looked for him.</p>

	<p>“I do not have the time for that right now.” After saying that, Han Sen readied himself to leave.</p>

	<p>Ancient Devil asked, “If we do not put the main and the reverse universal tracks back together, how many Break
		World beasts do you think you will be able to kill? Plus, the targets of the life souls are not just
		xenogeneics. They might even possess your family and friends. Are you going to kill them too?”</p>

	<p>Han Sen looked at Ancient Devil and asked, “What do you mean?”</p>

	<p>He knew Ancient Devil was right. No matter how strong his power was, he could not kill all the life souls
		singlehandedly. He would not be able to keep everyone he cared about safe.</p>

	<p>Ancient Devil looked at the black hole in the sky as he said, “If I have guessed things correctly, Sky King must
		have woken up.”</p>

	<p>“What is Sky King’s history?” Han Sen guessed this might have something to do with Sky King. He had only just
		broken the world, yet he could use many of the weapon gene races located in the Soldier Knife Sky. Plus, Qin Xiu
		needing him so badly had to mean something. It was enough for Han Sen to make some predictions and judgments.
	</p>

	<p>“Back then, God Chaos Party brought down the geno hall,” Ancient Devil said. “In the end, the last god hall
		leader successfully rebooted the universe. The results of doing that were far from perfect, but it was not as if
		it had been a useless thing to do. The universe of kingdom’s universal rules are very broken. The buffer zone
		between the two universes was split into 33 skies. That did not happen suddenly. The old leader prepared for
		this a long time ago.”</p>

	<p>“What does that mean?” Han Sen asked with a frown.</p>

	<p>Ancient Devil smiled. “To break the supremacy of the God Spirits, a new order must be built to take over. The 33
		skies are the new god world the old leader wanted. After the geno hall was destroyed, the 33 skies were to
		become the center between both universes and control the process of reincarnation between all living things. It
		was to be beyond everything.”</p>
