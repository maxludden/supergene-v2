<p>“If I said I was lost, would you believe me?” Han Sen asked.</p>
<p>Barr raised his eyebrows at the answer. He gave Han Sen a weird
look and said, “You are lost out here?”</p>
<p>“What is this place?” Han Sen asked.</p>
<p>“We’re in an underdeveloped, barren area. It isn’t far from a
large barren system. As for precisely where we are, I can’t really
tell you. After all, this place is mostly unexplored. There are no
maps here,” Barr said.</p>
<p>Han Sen was shocked. He thought to himself, “A big barren
system? That means it most likely belonged to Sacred in ancient
times. It is an entrance to the sanctuaries. This was the place
that Old Cat brought Littleflower.”</p>
<p>“What are you doing in such a dangerous place?” Han Sen asked
Barr.</p>
<p>“This place isn’t a large barren system, so it isn’t too
dangerous. It is just a poor system with few resources, but a small
race here discovered a xenogeneic space. They claimed they found
something awesome here. That is why I have come out here to look.”
Barr looked at Han Sen and said, “Are you interested in visiting
this xenogeneic space to check?”</p>
<p>Han Sen didn’t answer. The few deified elites that were
accompanying Barr approached him. One of them smiled and said,
“Barr, why don’t you introduce us to this friend of yours?”</p>
<p>“This is the human called Dollar. He was the Marquise winner of
the last Geno Being Scroll,” Barr explained to the deified, his
voice carrying a modicum of respect. He was quite polite to this
other Destroyed.</p>
<p>After that, Barr pointed at the deified elite and said, “Dollar,
this is the Destroyed’s transmutation deified. He is Elder
Nader.”</p>
<p>Barr didn’t introduce the other people around Elder Nader. He
only said they were students of Elder Nader.</p>
<p>They were all just Kings or half-deifieds. Barr himself was
already deified, and he couldn’t be bothered to introduce them
all.</p>
<p>Elder Nader could see that Barr was being very friendly to Han
Sen. He thought Han Sen had to be an elite from some big race, but
he was just some scion of a smaller race. The man swiftly lost
interest, and he only addressed the occasional casual remark toward
Han Sen.</p>
<p>Dollar had reached first place in the Marquise Geno Being
Scroll, but Marquises were very different from deifieds. Nader
thought he had no reason to take a deified that came from a small
race seriously.</p>
<p>Although it was difficult to become deified, the smaller races
occasionally got lucky. They might stumble upon a treasure or get
their hands on a resource from a stronger race and become
deified.</p>
<p>But deifieds like that always had a bad base. They lacked
knowledge and practical skills, and they were likely to cause
trouble.</p>
<p>The Destroyed had previously adopted a few deifieds like that,
but showing such benevolence had never worked out well for the
Destroyed. The deifieds did little to benefit the Destroyed, and
instead, they were a frequent pain in the *ss for their host race.
Ever since then, the Destroyed had stopped recruiting deifieds from
smaller races. They would rather raise their own elites.</p>
<p>If Han Sen had been from a big race, Elder Nader would have
liked to talk to him. But after learning who Dollar was, he was no
longer interested.</p>
<p>Elder Nader might not take Han Sen seriously, but Barr knew
about Dollar through Dia Robber. Even Dia Robber really admired the
elusive Dollar, so Barr would never think about underestimating
him.</p>
<p>“Brother Dollar, if there is nothing else for you to do here,
how about you come with us to explore that xenogeneic space?” Barr
said, inviting Han Sen along again.</p>
<p>“We can explore together, but if we get something good, how will
we split it?” Han Sen wasn’t really interested in a xenogeneic
space, but he didn’t know much about this system. Following Barr
and the others might save him from some trouble in the future.</p>
<p>“Elder Nader is a transmutation deified. He has the most power
here. He will take 60% of the goods. How about we split the other
40% between you and me?” Barr suggested after a moment of
silence.</p>
<p>Elder Nader wasn’t very happy about that proposition. In his
eyes, Dollar was just a primitive deified. Twenty percent was too
much, he believed. Dollar shouldn’t receive any more than ten
percent.</p>
<p>But since Barr had already made the offer, Elder Nader wasn’t
going to embarrass the man by stepping on his toes. He remained
quiet.</p>
<p>Han Sen shook his head. “That isn’t very fair. Never mind.”</p>
<p>“Brother Dollar, how would you suggest we split it? You can tell
us.” Barr knew this adventure would be dangerous. Having an elite
like Dollar would benefit their mission quite a bit.</p>
<p>“I’m always very fair. If this is a co-operation, I think we
should split the rewards 50/50. The Destroyed get 50, and the
humans get 50,” Han Sen said seriously.</p>
<p>Fury swept through Elder Nader and his students, and they wanted
to burst out crying and laughing at the same time.</p>
<p>He had already been a little upset about the prospect of Han Sen
receiving 20%, but he knew that discovering a new xenogeneic space
could be a dangerous and weird adventure. Enlisting the help of an
extra deified was a good idea. He wouldn’t have agreed to the 20%
offer if he hadn’t understood that having Han Sen along could prove
useful. But now, Han Sen wanted 50% of the total goods. That was
too ridiculous.</p>
<p>“Small races have their diminutive status for a reason. After
becoming deified, they do tend to become full of themselves. I’m
afraid he doesn’t even know the difference between a primitive
deified and a transmutation deified. And he wants to split the
goods 50/50?” Elder Nader was angered by the suggestion. He looked
at Han Sen and snorted. “If you were a larva deified, I would
consider 50/50.”</p>
<p>“I am primitive. I will only accept 50/50.” Han Sen stood his
ground.</p>
<p>Even though he was only primitive, his body was incredibly
strong, and he had studied many geno arts. Even ordinary
transmutation deifieds couldn’t really defeat Han Sen. So, Han Sen
believed 50/50 was fair.</p>
<p>But Elder Nader was not of the same opinion. After hearing Han
Sen, he laughed. “Your stomach is too big. We can’t feed you.”</p>
<p>“In that case, I have to go,” Han Sen said. Then, he turned to
Barr and told him, “Brother Barr, do you have a star map I can
purchase? I would really appreciate it if you could sell one to
me.”</p>
<p>“It is just a star map. It isn’t worth much. Just take it, if
you need it.” Barr opened his communicator and sent the star map to
Han Sen.</p>
<p>“Thanks a lot. We will meet again, Brother Barr.” Han Sen
accepted it and nodded his thanks.</p>
<p>Seeing Han Sen leave, one of Elder Nader’s students laughed. “He
really doesn’t know his place. He thinks that becoming deified has
made him invincible in the universe. A deified like him, who
doesn’t know his place, is as insubstantial as smoke. There is
nothing for him to be cocky about.”</p>
<p>“Yeah, he is just a primitive deified. Our master could squeeze
him to death with one hand. Why be so polite to him?”</p>
<p>“I am afraid he doesn’t understand how much difference there is
between a primitive and a transmutation. That is why he was so
confident. Master, you should take this into your own hands and
show him who the boss is.”</p>
<p>“Who gave him the confidence to suggest going 50/50 with the
master?”</p>
<p>The students kept talking and judging Han Sen. They sounded as
if they were all stronger than Han Sen. They had clearly forgotten
that they were all Kings and Han Sen was deified.</p>
