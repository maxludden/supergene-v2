    <p>Han Sen was very eager to read the contents of the diary.</p>
    <p>
      Although it was a diary, the entries weren’t dated. And furthermore, each
      page only contained a sentence or two. The entries were not a continuous
      thing, either. It was a casual, random recording of stuff.
    </p>
    <p>
      “3480, why is he so dumb? I can’t believe he got killed by a Jade Bone
      Beast.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Has 5079’s brain filled up with water? With his power, he might as well
      have a death wish by going to the Galaxy Sea.”
    </p>
    <p>“He died. What a dumb*ss.”</p>
    <p>…</p>
    <p>
      The diary was full to the brim of complaints, but Han Sen wasn’t sure what
      the numbers meant.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Are the crystallizers practically the same as humans? Were they in the
      sanctuary to hunt creatures? Are the numbers the names of their friends?”
      Han Sen thought to himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      There were many complaints, but Han Sen made sure to read every single
      word. He didn’t want to accidentally skip over an important detail and
      lose a potential lead.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ultimately, the results were disappointing. Han Sen had managed to read
      half of it, but the content up until then had been unchanging. It was like
      the person who had been writing the diary was a very bored recorder. It
      sounded as if they watched people fight all day.
    </p>
    <p>
      Han Sen managed to hold back the urge of skipping to the last page,
      though, and he went through the diary page by page. After going through a
      bunch more, however, his eyes finally came across some text that roused
      him back to full consciousness.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Forty-four days to go before returning. There is still no one who is
      qualified. It looks like the mission has failed.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Returning? What does returning mean? And qualified for what? What does
      that mean?” Han Sen was confused. He kept on reading, hoping to find an
      answer.
    </p>
    <p>
      But right after, it led back to more typical complaints. Han Sen read
      through another dozen pages, though, and he came across something else
      that stood out.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Mission failed. Unable to track Number 4. We can finally get out of here.
      There is no longer a need for us to suffer in this place anymore.”
    </p>
    <p>
      After that page, the diary was empty, and it looked like the owner of the
      diary left and no longer felt the urge to write inside it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Han Sen’s heart jumped, and so he flicked back through the pages. He
      remembered seeing the writer complain about a Number 4 earlier, but at the
      time, he might not have noticed it.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the diary owner left, they mentioned Number 4. To be featured on the
      final page, Number 4 had to be a person of some importance.
    </p>
    <p>
      Han Sen then gathered all the complaints and entries he could find that
      made mention of Number 4.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Number 4 is not bad. Her sword is good. She has reached kindergarten
      level.”
    </p>
    <p>“Number 4 wants to kill Blood-River God. She must have a death wish.”</p>
    <p>“Damn! Number 4 did it. That was some dogshit luck.”</p>
    <p>…</p>
    <p>
      After Han Sen read them all, he noticed that the author really had paid
      attention to Number 4.
    </p>
    <p>
      The diary’s owner, when complaining about the others, did so differently.
      It was as if she was an absolute superior, and her comments were written
      like the observation notes on monkeys in a zoo.
    </p>
    <p>
      Even though the diary’s owner seemed to complain about Number 4 the most,
      it was different. It felt like they shared something, and that Number 4
      wasn’t regarded as a lower-tier being.
    </p>
    <p>After Han Sen read all the complaints, he came to a few conclusions.</p>
    <p>
      Number 4 was a female. He did not know if she was a crystallizer or what,
      but she was a female.
    </p>
    <p>
      She used a sword and she was very strong. There was one mention of Cruel
      Chi, and he had heard of its existence as a demigod super creature. Normal
      super creatures wouldn’t dare provoke that beast.
    </p>
    <p>
      The complaints said Number 4 managed to kill the monster. Although the
      diary said her sword skills were not great, like that of a little kid, the
      progression seemed smooth. Number 4 must have been able to kill the
      creature with ease.
    </p>
    <p>And there was a point in which she was mentioned to be beautiful.</p>
    <p>
      One of the complaints stated, “Why is being pretty something to be proud
      about? Being pretty can often lead to arrogance. D*mn Number 4!”
    </p>
    <p>
      Han Sen connected a few more of the complaints to paint a clearer picture.
      He learned a baby creature managed to approach Number 4 and follow her.
      That was why the diary had a line that read like that.
    </p>
    <p>
      Han Sen’s ultimate conclusion was that Number 4 was pretty. She had great
      sword skills and could slay super creatures.
    </p>
    <p>
      Han Sen combined all those clues and threads, and eventually, he had a
      clear idea of who she was in his mind.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Gu Qingcheng! Could that really be her?” That seemed a little impossible,
      as Han Sen figured that he could probably make a rough guess about the
      book’s age. And it was a crystallizer thing, written by and about those of
      their own kind.
    </p>
    <p>
      And it wasn’t as if Gu Qingcheng was the only woman who was pretty and
      wielded a sword. There were many spirits and humanoid creatures like that,
      too.
    </p>
    <p>
      Han Sen read a bit more of the included content, and aside from Number 4,
      there were no other special things. The other numbers did not seem to be
      half as important. They were usually single mentions, and after a
      complaint, they were never mentioned again.
    </p>
    <p>
      “I need to ask Gu Qingcheng if she was the one who killed Cruel Chi.
      Depending on her answer, I’ll be able to find out if this was really her.”
      Han Sen thought the possibility of this was low, but he still wanted to go
      back and ask.
    </p>
    <p>
      Han Sen poked around the bedroom some more, and aside from a few various
      oddities and bottles, there was nothing else to investigate. The beetle
      was silent the whole time, too.
    </p>
    <p>
      Aside from those two rooms, there was no other way out, either. There was
      nothing worth taking, so he exited by the way in which he entered.
    </p>
    <p>
      The items, bottles, and the diary were all placed inside the Cruel Bottle
      by Han Sen.
    </p>
    <p>
      When Han Sen exited the room, however, he was given a shock. Six Paths was
      standing right outside like a blood man. Han Sen almost didn’t recognize
      him.
    </p>
    <p>Crash!</p>
    <p>
      When Six Paths saw Han Sen, his body collapsed. He spilled blood as he
      tumbled backwards.
    </p>
    <p>
      Han Sen immediately went to pick him up. He placed him on his back and
      thought to himself, “Why were you so stubborn? This was just a path. It
      does not determine your future.”
    </p>
    <p>
      Han Sen forgot about the fact he was the only one who had walked to the
      end. The answers for what he was looking for would not affect him, but
      he’d continue looking.
    </p>
    <p>
      Little Lion King and Yu Miao saw Han Sen carrying the unconscious Six
      Paths, and their faces looked strange.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Boss! You are so strong. Even Six Paths could not reach the end, but you
      did,” Jade Little Lion said.
