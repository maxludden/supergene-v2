<p>Aside from providing him with healing geno fluids, she gave him
other kinds of geno fluids as well. They could help with all sorts
of things involving his body and his practice. They were fluids
synthesized by the Very High themselves. Due to the wealth of
resources available in Outer Sky, Han Sen was being given access to
resources that few Kings could ever hope to get their hands on.</p>
<p>The Very High didn’t have a large population. They didn’t have
many people devoted to producing healing geno fluids, but they also
rarely used healing geno fluids themselves. So, most of the time,
the Very High created the geno fluids quite slowly. They kept
enough on hand for ordinary use, but as Han Sen stubbornly
continued to fight the Red Blood Demon, he had created a situation
that the Very High were uniquely unprepared for.</p>
<p>Within a month, Han Sen had almost cleared out their geno fluid
reserves. If he wanted more, he would have to wait for more to be
created. That meant one every few days.</p>
<p>“Why are there no more healing geno fluids?” Han Sen saw the
geno fluids Exquisite had brought him, and he noticed they weren’t
the same geno fluids he usually used. Rather than the healing
fluids that he really needed, these other geno fluids would merely
reinforce his genes and physical power.</p>
<p>“Even if there was a whole warehouse full of healing geno fluid,
it wouldn’t be enough to support the amount you keep consuming,”
Exquisite said. She pointed toward a box with six red geno fluids
and went on to say, “This is a high-class healing geno fluid. They
only offer it to deified fighters. Since there are no more of the
weaker fluids available, you are being gifted these. Do not go
through them willy-nilly. If you use up these, you won’t be granted
any more for the next two weeks.”</p>
<p>Exquisite didn’t know that Blood Marrow Geno Fluid had the
xenogeneic genes of the Red Blood Demon in it. After all, few
people knew exactly what was inside a medicine when they took it.
The Red Blood Demon’s xenogeneic genes were just one element of
these fluids. They weren’t even the primary ingredient.</p>
<p>Even if Exquisite had known the xenogeneic genes were in the
fluid, she wouldn’t have known about the potential side effects in
this situation. Liyu Zhen and Li Xue Cheng knew about this because
one of their elders had used a large amount of Blood Marrow Geno
Fluid before going into the Jail Demon Hall to kill the Red Blood
Demon. The Red Blood Demon had instantly gone into a fury.</p>
<p>Luckily, the man had been a larva class deified. Despite the Red
Blood Demon’s rage, he had been able to kill it. Only a few people
who were close to that elite knew about this. Exquisite and Li Keer
didn’t know much about that elite, so they didn’t know how taking
the geno fluid would affect the monster inside the hall. Liyu Zhen
and Li Xue Cheng wouldn’t have come up with this plan if the
creature’s reaction to the geno fluid was generally known.</p>
<p>Hearing that there was an even better geno fluid that he could
use, Han Sen was more than pleased. If he could recover faster, he
could spend more time fighting the Red Blood Demon.</p>
<p>Although he was unable to beat the Red Blood Demon, he was
honing his talents as he fought the creature. That was because the
Red Blood Demon had been continuously suppressing him. Han Sen had
gained a huge amount of experience by being so determined.</p>
<p>“This kind of wound really hurts.” Han Sen looked down at his
chest and saw his exposed heart, which had come close to being
shredded. He had a wry smile.</p>
<p>If Han Sen had lacked his impressive abilities of recovery, such
a strike would have likely killed him.</p>
<p>Opening a Blood Marrow Geno Fluid, Han Sen quickly gulped it all
down. He felt a warm sensation race through his body. A numb, itchy
feeling passed over his wounds, and Han Sen’s injuries began to
heal. He watched in amazement as his wounds sealed closed.</p>
<p>“This is good stuff. No wonder this is considered a superior
item usually reserved for deified elites. The effects are ten times
stronger than what I was using before.” Han Sen grinned widely when
he saw the wounds heal so quickly.</p>
<p>His wounds would have taken half a day to heal previously, but
now they took less than an hour.</p>
<p>But the Apollo Set hadn’t recovered yet, so Han Sen had to keep
waiting. Without the Apollo Set, his body wouldn’t last.</p>
<p>Han Sen didn’t waste a single second of his free time, though.
He practiced Very Real Body and God’s Wander for a bit. Those two
geno arts were very beneficial for him to practice with. They could
be used at any time.</p>
<p>When the Apollo Set had finally recovered, Han Sen decided it
was time to enter Jail Demon Hall again.</p>
<p>But to Han Sen’s surprise, the Red Blood Demon was sitting on
the stairs staring at him when he entered. It didn’t attack him as
soon as it saw him.</p>
<p>“What is this?” Han Sen wondered. It seemed odd that on this
random day, the Red Blood Demon’s temper had improved so much.</p>
<p>While Han Sen wondered what it was doing, the Red Blood Demon’s
body flashed with a bloody light. Its bug wings opened. The strange
horn on its head flashed with a crimson that looked like a sun.</p>
<p>“Holy shit! What is going on with this guy? Why has it suddenly
exploded with a scary power like this?” Han Sen was very confused.
He had fought the Red Blood Demon for a very long time now, but he
had never seen it so enraged. And it had suddenly gained a
frightening amount of power.</p>
<p>Before Han Sen had time to consider his situation, he saw the
Red Blood Demon’s evil-looking crimson eyes light up like
lightbulbs and turn to stare at him. Han Sen didn’t say anything.
He just wanted to teleport away from Jail Demon Hall.</p>
<p>Han Sen couldn’t fight the Red Blood Demon at its normal power
level, but now, it was a raging version of itself. For all he knew,
this thing could destroy his body in one punch and cripple him,
leaving him no chance of teleporting away.</p>
<p>But the moment Han Sen ripped space open to leave, he saw all of
the markings across Jail Demon Hall light up in a single, brilliant
flash. The whole of the Jail Demon Hall was covered in a holy
light.</p>
<p>Pang!</p>
<p>Han Sen bounced out of space and almost hit the ground. He
descended into a nice roll, which was how he managed to maintain
his balance.</p>
<p>“What is this? Why have Jail Demon Hall’s restrictions flared up
and sealed the entire structure with me inside?” Han Sen’s face
changed. He looked around frantically, and he found that wavy beams
of light covered every surface of the hall. The whole building was
sealed up tight, and there was no getting out now.</p>
<p>Han Sen realized that he was in a scary and dangerous situation.
Jail Demon Hall was sealed, and he couldn’t use God’s Wander to
leave. He was trapped inside with the beast.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the Red Blood Demon had become far more dangerous
than usual. When Han Sen had fought the Red Blood Demon previously,
he could only last a few minutes. But now, the Red Blood Demon was
in a scary mode.</p>
<p>Thinking of this, Han Sen turned his attention back to the Red
Blood Demon. The Red Blood Demon’s eyes were giving off red light.
It looked like a small flashlight—the beam of which landed on Han
Sen.</p>
<p>“What is this… I thought we were friends! I’m just taking a
break here, you go and do your stuff… No need to worry about me…”
Han Sen forced a smile at the Red Blood Demon as he spoke.</p>
<p>The Red Blood Demon actually smiled back at Han Sen. But that
smile sent a chill down his spine. The jagged, razor-like teeth
that lined its maw were particularly menacing to see. It was like a
demon that could destroy and devour anything.</p>
<p>The next second, the Red Blood Demon let out a strange screech.
Its body was like a red shadow, and it was coming straight for Han
Sen. Han Sen’s eyesight couldn’t read its movements, either. He saw
the flash of a red shadow, but the Red Blood Demon remained where
it was. Then, another Red Blood Demon appeared in front of him. Its
sharp claws were already digging into his chest.</p>
