<p>Who would have suspected that Han Sen’s reaction would end up
surprising Mister Yang? He was not angry. He actually laughed.</p>
<p>Han Sen pointed at the overbearing bug and asked, “I don’t need
to be your servant, but if I kill it, can I have its body?”</p>
<p>After that, he looked at Mister Yang and asked, “Old Yang, can
that gene race be food for Small Cat?”</p>
<p>“I suppose it could be…” Mister Yang’s expression looked weird.
Using a king-class gene race to feed a newborn gene race seemed
excessive. While it was possible, it might end up just being a
waste. “Of course, you can.” The white-clothed young man hastily
nodded.</p>
<p>Peaceful looked awfully glum. She wished to protest, but all she
could really do was mumble under her breath and not say anything
audibly.</p>
<p>The white-clothed young man looked at Peaceful and rushed her to
get started. “Peaceful, hurry up and get your overbearing bug to
attack him. I want to see if he can really kill the overbearing bug
with his bare hands.”</p>
<p>Peaceful’s eyes twitched. She seemed to be struggling with the
request. In the end, she adhered to what the young man in white
clothes told her. She commanded the overbearing bug to attack Han
Sen.</p>
<p>This overbearing bug was different from Shibo’s overbearing bug.
Its carapace was black, but it had a golden sheen. Its power and
speed were far greater than Shibo’s overbearing bug.</p>
<p>“Do you want to use my overbearing bug as cat food? You can go
to hell!” Peaceful was secretly furious. She hoped the overbearing
bug could swallow Han Sen in one gulp.</p>
<p>The overbearing bug’s body was very big, but its speed was quite
scary. It was just like a flea. Its body became blurry a little as
it teleported in front of Han Sen.</p>
<p>Its mouth was full of long teeth that were going to try
swallowing Han Sen, but Han Sen raised his arm high and threw a
punch down.</p>
<p>Boom!</p>
<p>The overbearing bug’s head was punched into the ground. Brain
juice went everywhere. It was murdered outright.</p>
<p>Peaceful’s eyes almost popped out of their sockets. Before, Han
Sen had been able to punch a juvenile overbearing bug, but her
overbearing bug was an adult. Still, Han Sen was able to obliterate
its brain. It was extremely hard to believe.</p>
<p>The white-clothed young man was astounded as he watched from
nearby. He clapped and said, “Very interesting. You can really kill
an overbearing bug with your bare hands. How are you so
strong?”</p>
<p>Han Sen looked at the young man and asked, “Will you uphold your
promise?”</p>
<p>“Of course. Peaceful, give him the body of your overbearing
bug.” The white-clothed young man walked over to Han Sen. As he
walked, he asked, “Your name is Han Sen, right? Were you born with
a Blood-Pulse? If so, what Blood-Pulse do you have? How can you be
so powerful?”</p>
<p>After that, the young man in white clothes reached out his hands
to touch Han Sen’s muscles. He looked curious as he did so.</p>
<p>“Mister… No…” The white-clothed young man had yet to touch Han
Sen when a shadow appeared in front of him. He could not get close
to Han Sen.</p>
<p>“Did I not request that you guys not follow me? Why are you
here?” The young man in white clothes did not look happy. He madly
looked at that person.</p>
<p>“My bad.” The man kneeled before the young man, but it did not
look as if he was going to budge. He lowered his head and said,
“This person is too dangerous. Please, do not put yourself at
risk.”</p>
<p>The white-clothed young man coldly shouted, “I just wanted to
talk to him! Why would it be dangerous? Go back now!”</p>
<p>“Mister, please just think about it.” The man remained in front
of the young man as if he was not going to leave.</p>
<p>“I am taking the overbearing bug.” Han Sen sensed that the
white-clothed young man was someone special, but that did not
matter to him. He waved at the white-clothed young man and walked
over to the overbearing bug. He picked up its body and planned to
leave.</p>
<p>“Annoying asshole! Get out of my way.” The young man in white
clothes looked very irritated. He kicked the kneeling man out of
the way and walked over to Han Sen.</p>
<p>“Han Sen, if you are willing to return with me, I can promise
you great wealth,” the young man in white clothes passionately
said.</p>
<p>“Why do you want me to come with you so badly?” Han Sen asked as
he continued to walk.</p>
<p>“My big sister has a very powerful gene race,” the white-clothed
man said as he gritted his teeth. “I keep losing and end up getting
bullied by her. I want you to help me beat her gene race so I can
exact my revenge.”</p>
<p>Han Sen rolled his eyes. “I am human. I am not a gene race.”</p>
<p>“I know, but there are no rules suggesting humans cannot compete
in an arena,” the young man seriously said.</p>
<p>“I am not going,” Han Sen said. He didn’t even turn around to
look at the young man as he spoke.</p>
<p>“I thought you wanted the bodies of gene races,” the
white-clothed young man quickly said. “If you can kill my big
sister’s gene race, you can have the body.”</p>
<p>“Not interested.” Han Sen did not even think twice about
rejecting the offer. He did not really need gene races.</p>
<p>“I will give you 10 gene eggs… No… I will give you 20…” The
young man kept making offers. He looked as if he was not going to
give up.</p>
<p>Han Sen kept ignoring him and continued walking away.</p>
<p>The white-clothed young man did not want to give up. He kept
following Han Sen, trying to convince him.</p>
<p>Peaceful and the guard were following the young man. They were
on alert. They stared at Han Sen. They were afraid Han Sen might do
something bad to the young man.</p>
<p>Han Sen was getting annoyed by the young man. He pointed to
Peaceful and casually said, “Fine, if you want me to go to that
arena, then make her become my slave.”</p>
<p>Peaceful was furious and asked, “What did you just say?”</p>
<p>Upon hearing this, the young man looked very happy. He looked at
Han Sen and asked, “Do you mean it?”</p>
<p>“Yeah, I am serious,” Han Sen said with a laugh. “Peaceful, do
that for me,” the young man in white clothes said to Peaceful.</p>
<p>The expressions on Han Sen and Peaceful immediately changed. Han
Sen thought, “Jesus Christ, what kind of landlord’s stupid son is
this? He really agreed.”</p>
<p>Peaceful was the granddaughter of Dragon Song City’s leader.
Ordinary people would not have agreed with Han Sen’s condition.
Even Big Qin Kingdom’s king would not have humiliated his
children’s subordinates.</p>
<p>Yet, the white-clothed young man had immediately agreed to give
Peaceful to Han Sen as a slave. How stupid was he to say something
like that?</p>
<p>Peaceful kneeled and said with simmering anger, “Mister… Please
grant me death…”</p>
<p>Even the guard looked at the white-clothed young man strangely,
but he held his tongue.</p>
<p>Upon hearing Peaceful wanted to die, the white-clothed young man
froze. He wished to say something more, but the guard suddenly
shouted, “Careful, Mister!”</p>
<p>After that, the guard’s body shone with a strange light. Wings
appeared on his back, and strange horns were on his head. He threw
a punch into the sky.</p>
<p>A bolt of lightning came down from the sky. It burned the guard
into a crisp. He fell to the ground and died.</p>
<p>Han Sen turned around. He saw a beautiful woman with white wings
wearing a white dress come forth with lightning crackling around
her. She descended from the sky like a wrathful angel.</p>
