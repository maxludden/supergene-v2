<h3>Chapter 2770</h3>

<p>Barr was a primitive deified elite. With his full power, he
could devastate a planet with a single punch. But he couldn’t
resist those branches that reached out and began to wrap themselves
around him. The branches tied him up like a cocoon, with only his
head poking out above the leaves.</p>
<p>Barr wasn’t the only one to be caught; even the transmutation
class Elder Nader was unable to escape. He released his power in a
massive surge, but under the force of the branches, his power was
like snow melting under a spring sun. His attempts to protect
himself dissolved into nothing, and then the branches bound him
firmly.</p>
<p>No creature upon the plank bridge was exempted from this. They
were all tied up in cocoons of various sizes, and soon they were
all dangling helplessly from the bridge.</p>
<p>As Han Sen looked at them, he was struck by how much they looked
like caterpillars. He had often found those insects hanging from
the trees near his old house. They would hang from the branches,
motionless unless a wind caught them and waved them back and forth.
The sight before him was eerily similar.</p>
<p>Han Sen kept observing the captured creatures, falling back as
he did. Even Elder Nader had been unable to resist the ensnaring
branches. Han Sen didn’t think he was much stronger than Elder
Nader. If he got close, he might end up suffering the same fate. He
didn’t want to end up snared by the branches, too.</p>
<p>Dragon One and Bao Lian seemed to share his opinion. They all
made sure to retreat with haste.</p>
<p>The squawking of a bird sounded clearly throughout the sky.
Within a second, Han Sen felt a very frightening presence
descending on the strange realm. It rushed down from the sky in a
blur, moving too quickly for them to react. It was like watching a
plane crash. Although the bird itself remained in the sky, the
weight of the bird’s aura hit the ground, instantly crushing
anything on the surface.</p>
<p>Han Sen found that his body had been slammed down into the dirt,
and he couldn’t get up. The scary pressure was slowly pushing him
into the ground like it was made of quicksand. His face had almost
been crushed. He couldn’t get out.</p>
<p>Han Sen’s face was on its side, trying to discern where the
sound of that bird came from. Far away, up in the sky, he saw a
large bird burning with a white flame. It was soaring through the
air, and the very scary pressure came from its body.</p>
<p>Han Sen couldn’t be certain what kind of bird it was. It looked
elegant, proud, gorgeous, majestic; it was like a god from the sky.
It was like the legends that described the god phoenix. But Han Sen
had never seen a real phoenix before, so he couldn’t be sure if he
was seeing one now.</p>
<p>The big bird was soaring casually over the mountain. Wherever it
went, the landscape beneath it came back to life. Every tree, bush,
and blade of grass was brimming with lifeforce once more.</p>
<p>The big bird flew in slow circles, and it seemed like the whole
world was following it, hoping to be given a lifeforce again. The
green trees were repopulated with leaves. Flowers were popping up
out of the ground. Wherever the bird went, new life followed
behind. The deserted wasteland was turning into a tropical
paradise.</p>
<p>“A phoenix… It really is a phoenix…” Bao Lian was lying on the
ground next to Han Sen. He stared up blankly, seemingly at a loss
for how to react.</p>
<p>“I’ve been so unlucky recently. I entered an undeveloped
xenogeneic space and found a true god class xenogeneic phoenix. The
chances of that are lower than winning the lottery,” Han Sen
grumbled in his heart.</p>
<p>Fortunately, the phoenix wasn’t flying toward them. It flew to
the plank bridging the Two Ape Mountain. It glided slowly forward
on its huge wings until it reached the bridge.</p>
<p>After circling the bridge three times, the phoenix with its
white flames descended onto the wood. The fire on its body didn’t
harm the wood. It actually seemed to be forcing more lifeforce into
the plank, and it made the branches grow even faster.</p>
<p>The phoenix then lowered its head to look at the creature
nearest to it. The creature looked like a golem from what Han Sen
could see through the cocoon of branches. Only the golem’s head was
clearly visible.</p>
<p>“Answer a question for me. If the answer satisfies me, then I
will forgive you for offending me.” The phoenix didn’t physically
speak, but everyone who could see the phoenix could hear its voice
in their minds.</p>
<p>“I will answer any question you would like me to. What do you
want to know?” the golem-like creature said.</p>
<p>“One day, you and your partner encounter danger. One of you has
to die for the other to be saved, and you have the power to decide…
Do you choose to die for your partner to be saved? Or would you
prefer that your partner perish so that you could live?”</p>
<p>The voice of the phoenix rumbled, shaking their minds as it
spoke.</p>
<p>Everyone was shocked. They had expected the deity to ask about
some ancient secret. They never expected a question like this.</p>
<p>And it didn’t seem like the question had a single correct
answer. Different people would respond in different ways.</p>
<p>But since the phoenix had already asked, the golem couldn’t
refuse to answer. It swallowed and replied, “I would sacrifice
myself to save my partner so that she could live.”</p>
<p>“Hypocrite.” The phoenix’s voice played in everyone’s head. It
sounded disdainful.</p>
<p>The next second, Han Sen and the others watched the phoenix
lower its head. It opened its beak in the golem’s direction.</p>
<p>But the phoenix didn’t bite down. Rather, it made a sucking
motion, as if it was drawing in a breath. A weird power came out of
the golem’s body and vanished into the phoenix’s mouth.</p>
<p>After that strange power was taken away, the golem’s head looked
like a dried-up husk. Then, the entire creature turned into sand
and scattered across the wind. No trace of the being was left to
see.</p>
<p>Everyone stared at the place where the golem had been in
silence. Although the golem was just a King class creature, its
power had been drained until it was nothing more than dust. It was
a bit too scary to fully comprehend.</p>
<p>The phoenix didn’t seem to think that what it had done was a big
deal. Ignoring the sand that was still leaking from the now-empty
cocoon, the phoenix moved to the next cocooned creature like it was
walking down the aisle in a grocery store.</p>
<p>This creature’s head looked like it belonged to an octopus or
squid. Han Sen recognized this one. This being had been following
Elder Nader, so it had to be one of Elder Nader’s students.</p>
<p>That creature turned pale when the phoenix looked at him. And
then, he heard the phoenix’s voice sound again. Once more, it was
in everyone’s head. “One day, you and your partner encounter
danger. One of you has to die for the other to be saved, and you
have the power to decide. Do you choose to die for your partner to
be saved? Or would you prefer that your partner perish so that you
could live?”</p>
<p>That creature was terrified, but it noticed that the question
was exactly the same as before. He was so happy.</p>
<p>The golem had already given one answer, and that answer was
wrong. So, the squid creature assumed that the other answer must be
correct.</p>
<p>Thinking of that, the creature hastily shouted, “I would choose
to save myself!”</p>
<p>“Obscene.” Before the creature could explain why he had chosen
to save himself at his partner’s expense, the phoenix’s angry voice
rumbled in everyone’s heads.</p>
<p>The phoenix lowered its head and drew in a breath. The
creature’s power was ripped out of it, and the body turned into
dust. The wind carried it away.</p>
<p>A chill sank into the hearts of all the onlookers, and
goosebumps flared all over their skin. They thought that giving a
different answer to the question would allow them to live. But now,
it seemed as if the question posed by the phoenix had no correct
answer. It all depended on the phoenix’s mood.</p>
