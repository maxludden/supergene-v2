    <p>Sacred-Blood Inferno Bull: Fuse the transfigured beast souls.</p>

    <p>
      Han Sen looked at his new beast soul with a touch of hesitation. He had
      never thought it would reach the level of a sacred-blood transfiguration
      beast soul. It was a shame that it was only a humanoid beast soul. If it
      could transfigure, it could only battle with something that had an Inferno
      Bull&#8217;s status.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen was not really interested in the transfigured beast soul, but an
      Inferno Bull had the ability to fly. A beast soul like this would sell for
      a high price.
    </p>

    <p>
      And if he used black crystals to evolve it into a Berserk beast soul, its
      selling price would be even higher.
    </p>

    <p>
      There was another Mutant beast soul that was also a Shield beast soul, but
      Han Sen was not particularly interested in that type. He thus made plans
      to sell it further down the line.
    </p>

    <p>
      If there&#8217;s a humanoid transfigured beast soul, the chances of
      beating the Twin Spirit in battle will be much higher, Han Sen thought to
      himself.
    </p>

    <p>
      Although the Fairy Queen&#8217;s ability in the Second Shelter was close
      to that of the beast soul, she was prone to a particular weakness: When
      she was transfigured, she could no longer wear armor. If that happened,
      Han Sen&#8217;s defenses would be too low. He had no hope of withstanding
      attacks from the creatures from the Second Shelter.
    </p>

    <p>
      This entire situation had yet to yield a solution. Although Han
      Sen&#8217;s wounds were not grievous, they were genuinely quite serious.
      So he was for now sidelined, and he was left to think of how the Twin
      Spirit might be beaten.
    </p>

    <p>
      Before he returned to the Alliance, Han Sen went to see Li Xing Lun. He
      asked him to keep an eye out for anyone who was selling
      Humanoid-transfigured beast souls.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;A humanoid-transfigured beast soul? That sort of thing is extremely
      rare in the ice fields. Even if someone managed to get one, there&#8217;s
      no way they would be willing to trade,&#8221; Li Xing Lun said.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;I would offer a sacred-blood transfigured beast soul in exchange.
      Although it&#8217;s a beast, and not a humanoid, it possesses the ability
      of flight. Furthermore, it is a Berserk beast soul.&#8221; Han Sen
      explained.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;A Berserk sacred-blood transfigured beast soul that has a flying
      ability? Can such a thing actually be real?&#8221; Li Xing Lun&#8217;s
      face conveyed his shock, as he looked at Han Sen.
    </p>

    <p>
      They were both transfigured beast souls. Generally, the beast soul was not
      as good as a humanoid one, but the combination of it being a Berserk beast
      soul and its flying abilities changed the stakes. The price of a Berserk
      beast soul was higher than that of an ordinary beast soul, but the ability
      of flight made its value even greater.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Of course it&#8217;s true - do I have to lie?&#8221; Han Sen did
      not summon the Inferno Bull because he had not yet raised it to become
      Berserk. If he wished to sell it in the future, summoning it now would be
      a problem. This was because the Berserk one would look different to the
      one now, and would be easier for others to discover.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Okay, I will help you in asking around. How will I find you, if I
      have news?&#8221; Li Zing Lun asked.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;I am in the middle of conscription; it would be inconvenient for us
      to communicate. But I&#8217;ll soon travel to the Starwheel Shelter, so we
      can talk there later.&#8221; Han Sen said.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Okay.&#8221; Li Xing Lun said this straightforwardly but did not
      elaborate any further.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen then traveled from the Starwheel Shelter to the Alliance. While he
      healed the wounds he had incurred, he also tried to think how he might
      crack the Twin Spirit&#8217;s sword skills.
    </p>

    <p>
      With Han Sen&#8217;s knowledge opposed to their sword skills, all he would
      need is a little more time to conjure a blocking skill that would prevent
      their attacks. But their attacks would come at the same time, and to fight
      them all was different to battling an opponent one-to-one.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen wasn&#8217;t entirely sure whether he could block both of their
      sword skills. To be safe, Han Sen decided to learn a hyper geno art to
      withstand their sword skills.
    </p>

    <p>
      Because of this, he went to the Saint Hall community in the military base
      to find the hyper geno art he desired.
    </p>

    <p>
      The Twin Spirit&#8217;s sword skills relied entirely on speed, so there
      were many ways to overcome their flurry of attacks. One could use speed to
      beat their own speed, but another could enable a high defense to withstand
      each hit. Han Sen had seen many evolvers' hyper geno arts, but none had
      satisfied him.
    </p>

    <p>
      The military&#8217;s Saint Hall community, compared to the Saint Hall
      community ordinary people could visit, offered a far wider variety of
      hyper geno art.
    </p>

    <p>
      After Han Sen read the introduction, he found a species of the hyper geno
      art that made him feel optimistic.
    </p>

    <p>
      This was a joint-strike sword skill called &#8220;Dual&#8221;, one that
      required two people. That meant that two people were needed to practice
      the sword skill.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen thought about this for a moment. If each person was able to use
      one sword, it would be incredibly difficult for them to block the Twin
      Spirit&#8217;s dual blades. With their speed, it would not matter how fast
      Han Sen&#8217;s sword was - it would be extremely difficult for him to be
      faster than the Twin Spirit.
    </p>

    <p>
      If he wanted to beat them, Han Sen would require two swords. Therefore,
      Han Sen selected &#8220;Dual&#8221; for its double-strike sword skill.
    </p>

    <p>
      Of course, Han Sen did not think about looking for someone who could
      practice alongside him. He wanted to learn the &#8220;Dual&#8221; sword
      skill by himself and to learn to wield a sword in each of his hands in
      order to battle with the Twin Spirit. With this quality, the possibility
      of triumphing in battle became feasible.
    </p>

    <p>
      If this was anyone else, it would be impossible for them to use both hands
      to cast such a sword skill, but Han Sen possessed the necessary talent of
      &#8220;Both Hands&#8221;. His hands weren&#8217;t classed separately, as
      they were both considered primary, and the fortitude of his mind allowed
      for perfect individual control - he could use a different sword skill in
      each hand.
    </p>

    <p>
      He only needed to slightly modify the operation of the &#8220;Dual&#8221;
      skill. He would have no problem making use of this skill on his own.
    </p>

    <p>
      Besides this, Han Sen used his body to remember the joint-strike sword
      skill possessed by the Twin Spirit. He had learnt the Thirteen Slashes
      from the Overflow of Slaying All With Double Blades, and Han Sen believed
      that he could modify &#8220;Dual&#8221; to become a skill that could beat
      the Twin Spirit.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen was the owner of many S-Class licenses for the Saint Hall and
      without hesitating, he immediately purchased the sword skill
      &#8220;Dual&#8221;. He now only had to wait for the geno solution to
      arrive before he could begin to learn it.
    </p>

    <p>
      But the wounds Han Sen had incurred still had to heal, so he
      couldn&#8217;t put himself through exercises that were too vigorous. Every
      day he went to the shelter and ate the flesh of some mutant creatures that
      he had prepared, and spent the rest of his time figuring out how to modify
      the &#8220;Dual&#8221; sword skill.
    </p>

    <p>
      After he had started learning it, Han Sen noticed that the skills that
      required two people were completely different to one person wielding two
      blades. To complete this sword skill, it was nearly impossible for one
      person to do it solo.
    </p>

    <p>
      After all, if there were two people, they could strike from different
      positions. Being alone and using both hands, your position and angle was
      limited. So a lot of the moves in the &#8220;Dual&#8221; blade sword skill
      were impossible to perform with two hands.
    </p>

    <p>
      But Han Sen was not a person who gave up easily, and he could not think of
      any other ways he could defeat the Twin Spirit in battle.
    </p>

    <p>
      He was still set on making big changes to the &#8220;Dual&#8221; sword
      skill, but before that, he needed to learn the default sword skill in each
      hand and then adapt it into a sword skill that suited the use of both
      hands together.
    </p>

    <p>
      Perhaps this would have been difficult for other people, but Han Sen had
      practiced &#8220;Panorama&#8221; for many years. He had a great talent for
      fighting, so it would not be impossible for him to modify the skill on his
      own.
    </p>

    <p>
      While he was thinking about the Twin Spirit&#8217;s sword skill, he was
      also modifying his &#8220;Dual&#8221; skill, and at the same time, he
      referred to the Thirteen Slashes double-blade skill. His progress was
      rapid.
    </p>

    <p>Within twelve days, Han Sen had modified a double-blade skill.</p>

    <p>
      It was just that with this sword skill, there were many negatives. It was
      useless to dwell on them, so Han Sen decided to go to a virtual training
      camp. There, he would test out the skill he had created for real.
