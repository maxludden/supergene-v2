  “Han Sen, why is it like this? Why am I now able to grab the diamond great sword with the wooden sword in my hand? Why did it approve of me?” Qin Bai looked at Han Sen with confusion.

“There is a solution to everything in this world. It all depends on whether or not your solution is the correct one. This small, wooden sword is one such method, but it can only help you claim an ordinary weapon.” Han Sen was not going to tell him that the small wooden sword’s sword mind was equal to Jian Bu Gu’s. There would not be a sword that did not approve of Jian Bu Gu’s sword.

“It is no wonder why Bao’er could conquer so many emerald short swords!” Qin Bai exclaimed with shock.

Han Sen was not going to tell him that Bao’er had not used the short wooden sword. She did not need the wooden sword to do what she did.

“I want to conquer the other weapons, so what will I have to do to get those?” Qin Bai asked with curiosity. “Is there a small wooden knife and a small wooden spear?”

Han Sen smiled and said, “The way to sort this out is not just using a small wooden sword. If you can find the right solution, you can conquer any weapon. You can return the small wooden sword to Bao’er now.”

Qin Bai returned the small wooden sword to Bao’er. The weapons there were different from people. They did not think much. If the diamond great sword had already been conquered, even if there was no small wooden sword, it would not leave him.

Han Sen looked around. He looked at a knife and pointed it out to Qin Bai. He said, “Try and pick up that knife.”

“Do I just walk there and pick it up? Don’t I need to ready myself in some way?” Qin Bai asked as he peered at the knife.

It was a beautiful, long knife with a scabbard. The scabbard and handle were encrusted with gems. It seemed to be brightly twinkling. It was very shiny.

“Nope,” Han Sen said with certainty. “You don’t need anything. You just need to go over there and pick it up. I promise you it will obey

you.”

“Really?” Qin Bai did not believe him.

“Just try it. Are you going to learn the truth or chicken out?” Han Sen smiled.

Jia Shi Zhen and Thousand Mile Reach were curious and looked at the knife. They guessed what Han Sen was trying to do, but they did not believe he was that smart.

Jian Bu Gu smiled but did not speak. He quietly watched what was happening.

Qin Bai was easily provoked, so he ran over and tried to pick up the knife.

Qin Bai had merely touched the handle when a will came surging out of the knife. It seemed like it was dying to enter his arm. It was easily picked up without any resistance.

Seeing the knife happily circle Qin Bai in flight, it adhered to Qin Bai’s own actions by jumping. It was not just Qin Bai who was surprised. Thousand Mile Reach and Jia Shi Zhen were shocked too. They understood something. They looked at Han Sen with admiration.

“Han Sen, why is it like this?” Qin Bai curiously asked.

Han Sen replied, “Didn’t I tell you there is always a solution to figuring things out? It all depends on whether or not you can use those methods. The weapons did not approve of you because you did not know yourself or understand them. You approached them in the wrong way, which is why you failed.” “What is that supposed to mean?” Qin Bai did not understand.

“To sort out these problems, you must first understand the type of problem you have,” Han Sen said. “Your problem lies in your will not being able to match the will of the weapons. That was why they did not obey you. Your will matches with this knife’s will. Thus, when you tried to draw it, the knife was willing to follow you.”

“I see. In that case, how am I supposed to find out which knife has a will that is similar to mine?” Qin Bai looked at Han Sen with interest. He wanted to use his own power to discern which weapons to select.

“You will have to use a weapon-watching skill,” Han Sen said with a smile. “Thousand Mile Reach is an expert with this. You should probably ask her.”

“I would not dare. I am much worse than you, Mister Han.” Thousand Mile Reach spoke honesty. He would not try to lick his boots.

The weapons were asleep, so the presence of their will was at a minimum. Thousand Mile Reach could not find a suitable weapon for Qin Bai to select based solely on gauging their appearances.

“Thousand Mile Reach, you should stop being so humble,” Qin Bai said with great interest. “Just tell me which it is.”

Thousand Mile Reach felt touched. He had taught Qin Bai for many years, and this was the first time he had ever seen Qin Bai want to learn something. He really admired Han Sen.

Jia Shi Zhen strangely looked at Han Sen. She was shocked by Han Sen’s knowledge, power, and patience. It was no wonder he was able to teach Qin Bai a sword mind in such a short amount of time.

Jia Shi Zhen thought, “It is no wonder why Mister Jian is so willing to follow him. Han Sen is very peculiar.”

Thousand Mile Reach kept walking, explaining the foundation of weapon-watching skills to Qin Bai. Qin Bai listened very intently and kept on asking questions. He asked about many things. Before this day, it would have been an impossible concept for him to fathom.

In the past, when Qin Bai had his lessons, he felt as if he was in pain all the time. He felt as if he was locked up in prison. He only answered things when he was asked for. He was like a robot that did not learn much. He would never actively seek things out to learn.

Han Sen really to teach Qin Bai. After all, this was the boy who had become his friend after he arrived in the universe of kingdoms. Han Sen would have liked to help him in any way he could. He did not want to watch him fail as a king and end up destroying the Qin Kingdom.

If one took things from a serious perspective, Qin Bai was an heir of Qin Xiu. Han Sen’s body had some of Qin Xiu’s blood in it. In some way, they were related by blood. But outsiders could not really help much. If Qin Bai wanted to become a king, then it was good. It all depended on whether or not he could be awakened.

“Mister Jian, where is Soldier Knife Sky’s god temple?” Han Sen took a walk with Jian Bu Gu, who had been at the back of the group.

“Go in that direction. Within 3,000 miles, you should be able to espy the presence of that god temple.” Jian Bu Gu looked ahead. He appeared as if he was longing for something as he said, “I wonder if the sword is still there.”

“What sword?” Han Sen asked with curiosity.

“There is a sword a mile from here,” Jian Bu Gu said. “Back in the day, I was there when I was almost beaten. In the end, I was unable to draw it. After all these years, I do not know if it is still there or not.”

“If you were almost beaten by that sword, Mister Jian, I bet it must be a magical item. Why don’t you lead us there to take a look?” Han Sen was interested in the sword.

Thousand Mile Reach and Jia Shi Zhen were of a similar mind. Qin Bai showed excitement too. He wanted to try the watching-weapon skill he had just learned.

Jian Bu Gu pointed in a certain direction, so the group traveled that way. There was not a single human seen. Aside from weapons, it was as if there was nothing else there.

Boom!

After walking for almost 10 miles, an explosion came from the sky. The wind suddenly changed. The sky looked dark. It looked like a storm was rolling in.
