<p>“Do it again,” the bull monster said in a ragged voice. Giant
wings spread from the bull monster’s back and its body was covered
in blue scales, but the creature stared at Han Sen with childlike
intensity.</p>
<p>Han Sen had heard him repeat those three words several times
while they gambled. Han Sen had won seven times. By now, the bull
monster’s eyes looked as if they were going to burst into flames.
Han Sen was worried that the beast might attack him out of
frustration.</p>
<p>“How about you shake the coin, and I will guess?” Han Sen
suggested, setting the coin down in front of the monster.</p>
<p>When the bull monster heard him say this, his bull eyes
brightened. He reached out a massive hand, using a power to pull
the coin up into his coarse palms.</p>
<p>“You will do the guessing. We are still betting for that shield
on your back and the deified geno cores that I lost. You will have
to give them back,” the bull monster said to Han Sen while holding
that coin.</p>
<p>“Sure. I’m willing to bet it all.” Han Sen blinked and went on
to ask, “Brother Bull, what are you going to bet?”</p>
<p>The bull monster hesitated. It only had seven geno cores, and
they had all been lost to Han Sen. It had nothing more to gamble
with.</p>
<p>There were many elite and powerful xenogeneics scattered
throughout the universe, but few of them would think of hiding
something on purpose. They tended to be amazingly honest.</p>
<p>The bull monster wasn’t really giving up as much as it might
have seemed. It had seven geno cores, but it had only created one
of them by itself. The other six had been stolen from other
xenogeneics it had killed.</p>
<p>“Stolen” probably wasn’t the right word, though. The bull
monster had eaten the bodies of the xenogeneics, and when he ran
across their geno cores, he thought they might prove useful.
Therefore, he took them. And now, on this day, he had used them for
gambling.</p>
<p>Han Sen noticed that the bull monster wasn’t speaking. He
suspected that it had nothing left to use as a wager. He was
worried that the bull monster might get upset if it really had
nothing left to offer. He quickly said, “How about this, Brother
Bull? You’re smart and powerful enough to beat all the deifieds you
come across. You could probably gather ten shields and 100 geno
cores without much difficulty, if you wanted to. How about you do a
favor for me as a bet?”</p>
<p>“What favor would that be?” The bull monster was honest, but he
wasn’t stupid. He looked slightly warily at Han Sen.</p>
<p>“Actually, the favor wouldn’t really be helping me. I feel bad
for you, Brother Bull. It was that godd*mn *sshole that summoned
you. He didn’t bring you a sacrifice. He was just playing you. If I
see him again, I will try to punish him on your behalf. But I’m so
weak… I’m not sure if I can fight him. It would be very
embarrassing if I had to ask you to fight him on my behalf,” Han
Sen confessed, looking at the bull with embarrassment.</p>
<p>When the bull monster heard this, he thought Han Sen was a very
nice person. He actually wanted to help him. He looked at Han Sen
and nodded. “You’re good.”</p>
<p>“Then it is settled. If I lose, you can have the shield and your
geno cores back. And if you lose, when I find that guy again, I
will ask you to help me out with him. And you will help me, then
and there,” Han Sen explained, carefully confirming their
arrangement.</p>
<p>“Sure,” the bull monster said with a nod. Then, he proceeded to
shake the coin.</p>
<p>Han Sen watched the way the bull monster shook the coin. He knew
that the creature wasn’t very good at gambling.</p>
<p>After shaking it for a while, the bull monster held his hand out
in front of Han Sen. With an awkward look, he said, “You can
guess.”</p>
<p>“Brother Bull, do you know if it is the image or the number?”
Han Sen asked with a smile.</p>
<p>“About that…” The bull monster tried to think. He opened his
hand and glanced at the coin. Then, with a confident look, he said,
“Of course I know what it is. Hurry up and guess.”</p>
<p>“I guess…” Han Sen drew his voice out deliberately. He watched
the bull monster’s face. The bull monster looked very nervous, and
then he went on to say, “It is the image.”</p>
<p>When Han Sen said that, the bull monster’s face collapsed.</p>
<p>“Do it again.” The bull monster gnashed its teeth and started
shaking the coin.</p>
<p>“Do it again… Do it again… Do it again…”</p>
<p>An angry roar echoed through the sky, scarier than the thunder.
Han Sen couldn’t even remember how many times he had won by this
point. The bull monster probably owed him hundreds of favors by
now.</p>
<p>But Han Sen had to acknowledge that the bull monster was honest.
Although it had lost time and time again, it had never tried to
kill Han Sen in its rage.</p>
<p>Suddenly, the storm above them lessened and grew visibly weaker.
The rage left the bull monster’s face, and it shouted, “Oh no! The
God Spirit Storm is going to end. That means I have to go
back.”</p>
<p>“Why do you have to go back when the storm recedes?” Han Sen
asked with confusion.</p>
<p>Most people knew that the xenogeneics in the god area followed
the storms. They came when the storms came, and they vanished when
the storms did. But no one seemed to know why creatures could only
come and go with the storm.</p>
<p>The bull monster didn’t answer Han Sen. It hesitated for a bit,
then it pulled a purple scale and tossed it to Han Sen. “Use this
scale if you ever need help. Putting your power into it will
trigger it. I will follow the signal to come and find you.”</p>
<p>After that, the bull monster looked at Han Sen’s new heap of
geno cores. Then, it turned around and prepared to leave with the
fading storm.</p>
<p>“Brother Bull, hang on a sec.” Han Sen stopped the bull
monster.</p>
<p>“What now?” the bull monster said, staring balefully at him.</p>
<p>Han Sen grabbed one of the geno cores out of the seven he had
received. He threw it to the bull monster and said, “It is fate
that you and I were able to meet today. I don’t have anything good
to offer you, so you should keep this.”</p>
<p>The bull monster received the geno core with genuine glee. That
geno core was the one the creature had created itself, and it was
also the one that the bull monster had been looking at wistfully as
it turned to leave.</p>
<p>The other geno cores were of various elements, so they wouldn’t
help the bull monster much. But the geno core that the bull monster
had created was very precious to him.</p>
<p>“You really are so very kind.” The bull monster was very touched
by this gesture. He had wanted to steal Han Sen’s things, but
instead of holding a grudge, Han Sen was actually trying to help
him. The entire situation made the bull monster quite emotional. He
almost forgot that the geno core had originally belonged to him
anyway.</p>
<p>“Brother Bull, you should leave now. When I find that guy, I
will summon you so that you may teach him a lesson. I will avenge
you.” Han Sen waved his hand and said his goodbyes.</p>
<p>The bull monster was becoming even more emotional, but the
thunder was almost gone. He had no more time to speak. He thought
Han Sen was a very good person. If there was a chance, he would
definitely help Han Sen in the future.</p>
<p>When the bull monster disappeared with the thunderstorm, Han Sen
let out a long sigh.</p>
<p>“That was so close. I’m fortunate that he was an honest deified
xenogeneic. If he wasn’t, things might have turned out far worse
for me. I need to stop being so reckless. Deifieds are deifieds. I
cannot underestimate a single one of them.” Han Sen made up his
mind. If he saw Bao Lian again, he was going to end their feud.
Permanently.</p>
<p>After looking down and seeing that Exquisite was still in a
coma, Han Sen sent a small jolt of power into her body. It seemed
to unlock something inside of her, and Exquisite woke up.</p>
<p>When Exquisite woke up, she jumped up. She stared at Han Sen
with wide eyes and asked, “Why did you hit me?”</p>
<p>“When did I hit you? You were so exhausted that you fainted,”
Han Sen said with a guilty look.</p>
<p>“You…” Exquisite started to reply, but then she realized
something was amiss. She looked at the sky overhead and froze.
“Where is the God Spirit Storm?”</p>
