  Those who had evolved with sacred geno points maxed out almost had no need in First God's Sanctuary. And once punished by the God's Sanctuary rules, they would suffer incredible damage. So, most people would simply enter Second God's Sanctuary.

Even if they chose to stay in First God's Sanctuary, they would never be allowed to participate in the chosen contest in First God's Sanctuary. The most they could do was to kill some sacred-blood creatures, which would not matter that much to them.

As for super creatures, even a newbie evolver with all geno points maxed out would still be too weak to kill one.

Before practicing super geno arts design for evolvers, newbie evolvers did not have too much advantage other than a strong physique.

At this point, if Han Sen used all he got, his fitness would be comparable to an evolver with everything maxed out. However, Han Sen still did not dare to fight a super creature head on.

Since Mr. Yu had already evolved with all the geno points maxed out, Han Sen did not know why he was still in First God's Sanctuary.

Han Sen was not quite surprised. In fact, he had an idea when he found the fitness level of the guy in golden armor too high.

Even so, Han Sen did not think Mr. Yu deserved his attention. Since the guy's techniques were lacking, his fitness would not matter. It was like a small child playing with a big hammer. It was nothing to be bragged about.

Other people from Steel Armor Shelter turned pale. Going with a group like this to somewhere like devil Desert, anyone would feel uneasy. Some people even wanted to go back.

"Han Sen, what should I do?" Su Xiaoqiao whispered to Han Sen.

Su Xiaoqiao also felt scared. They had more people to begin with, and Mr. Yu was an evolver. Now they already had a conflict, and it would be more difficult after entering devil Desert.

"Since you have taken the money, we must go. Go on," said Han Sen.

Su Xiaoqiao also knew that it was impossible for him to quit the trip now. Luckily, Han Sen was with him, which gave him some courage.

Su Xiaoqiao lead the way in devil Desert. After traveling for six days, all they could see was dunes.

Everyone in Mr. Yu's group was arrogant. Although the people from Steel Armor Shelter were pissed, they chose to be silent since Mr. Yu was an evolver.

"There," Su Xiaoqiao said, pointing at a dune far away.

Everyone looked to their direction and saw a huge tree standing on top of the dune.

"There really is a huge tree in the desert." Mr. Yu's eyes lit up. He did not go to Second God's Sanctuary after evolving because he wanted to take advantage of his physique and kill some sacred-blood creatures for money. If he could kill a rare sacred-blood creature, it would be even better.

However, sacred-blood creatures were not that easy to be found, and he did not want to waste too much time in First God's Sanctuary. Therefore, he naturally did not want to return empty-handed from the trip to Devil Desert.

Han Sen was also surprised to see the tree. Normally speaking, large trees like this could hardly survive the desert. Most desert plants were something like cactus.

The group of people urged their mounts to approach the tree. They found the tree was even bigger than they thought after getting closer. The trunk was so thick that it took eight people throwing their arms around the tree to make a circle. And the tree must be at least 100 feet tall. They also found that like Su Xiaoqiao claimed, although the tree seemed intact, it was turned into charcoal entirely.

It did not seem like the tree was burned by fire either, since none of the leaves or branches was hurt. It was like the entire tree was carbonized in an instant.

"The tree was burned by the creature?" Han Sen asked Su Xiaoqiao, puzzled.

"I am not sure about that. I saw the creature landing on the tree from afar and only dared to approach the tree after it was gone. When I came here, the tree was already this way," said Su Xiaoqiao.

"Where is the creature?" Mr. Yu asked Su Xiaoqiao. He did not take all these men here just to see the tree.

"I only know that it went in that direction into the desert. As for where it went, I have no idea," Su Xiaoqiao pointed in the direction and said.

"Lead the way," Mr. Yu commanded.

"Our contract is quite clear. I am only responsible for taking you to see the tree. You will have to find the creature yourself," Su Xiaoqiao frowned and said.

"Cut the crap! Lead the way as we have asked." A follower of Mr. Yu exclaimed.

Su Xiaoqiao looked to Han Sen, and Han Sen said to Mr. Yu, "Mr. Yu, since you have signed a contract in my friend has fulfilled his duty. Please go there yourselves."

"Are you talking to me?" Mr. Yu looked at Han Sen with obvious contempt.

"I don't think there is a second Mr. Yu," said Han Sen casually.

"Since you know there is no other Mr. Yu here, you should know who the boss is," said Mr. Yu coldly.

"Now that I do not know," said Han Sen, squinting his eyes.

"If you don't know who the boss is, at least you should know who the strongest person is," a follower of Mr. Yu said coldly.

"That I do know." Han Sen nodded.

"Good. Only the strongest person could make the decision. All you need to do is to shut your mouth and lead the way." The follower gave Han Sen and Su Xiaoqiao a fierce stare.

Han Sen did not mean to move. He smiled and said, "I think you must have misunderstood something."

"Misunderstood?"

"I know who the strongest person is, but that person is not Mr. Yu,"

said Han Sen casually.

"Not Mr. Yu? You don't mean yourself?" Other followers laughed.

"Yes, that's what I meant." Han Sen nodded seriously.

"You must be out of your mind. You think you can be compared to an evolver who has maxed out on his sacred geno points?" They looked at Han Sen as if they were looking at an idiot.

"Not all evolvers are good," said Han Sen casually. Then he turned to Su Xiaoqiao and said, "Since the contract is fulfilled, we should leave now."

"Let me show you whether an evolver is good or not." Mr. Yu urged his mount to charge Han Sen.
