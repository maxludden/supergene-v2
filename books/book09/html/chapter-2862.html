<h2>Han Sen’s Galaxy Teleportation</h2>
<h3>Chapter 2862</h3>

<p>Han Sen knew what the Deep Abyss Knight’s problem was. He
thought, “It looks like Deep Abyss Knight already combined with the
universe’s god body by a god. His presence and scabbard are so
similar, and the scabbard was made from a broken god personality.
That means he is the scabbard’s master. He must be that Sky Armor
God.”</p>
<p>“It is no wonder God told me not to bring out the scabbard when
facing Sky Armor God. That is why. But that heads-up was fairly
useless. How was I supposed to know when and where Sky Armor God
would fight me? I could not hold off on using the scabbard forever.
With that being the case, what is the point in owning the scabbard
in the first place?”</p>
<p>After guessing Sky Armor God’s identity, Han Sen was not keen on
standing down. He continued looking at Sky Armor God, who was doing
the same.</p>
<p>Sky Armor God was holding the scabbard. Although he resonated
with the scabbard because it was man-made, recovering his body with
it would still take some time and tricks. Furthermore, Sky Armor
God did not want to open his chest in public and fit his bone back
inside.</p>
<p>For now, Sky Armor God only held the scabbard. The purple and
black flames on his body kept burning as he looked at Han Sen.</p>
<p>It was not an option for him to take the scabbard, concede, and
leave the space battleground. That was impossible. Gods had the
dignity of gods. Even if Sky Armor God wanted to leave, he had to
leave as the victor.</p>
<p>“Because you took my god personality, this is your unlucky day ”
Sky Armor God stared at Han Sen. He raised the scabbard and looked
at him with disdain. “As your reward for returning the scabbard, I
will allow you to die by the scabbard.”</p>
<p>After that, Sky Armor God waved his arm. The scabbard carried a
scary purple and black knife light. It came straight for Han
Sen.</p>
<p>The knife light acted as if it was splitting space in half. It
was so powerful that it made people’s hearts tremble. When seeing
this slash, the expressions on the faces of many deified
xenogeneics changed.</p>
<p>Han Sen’s body quickly flashed away. He had dodged the knife
light. When it appeared again, it was on the other side of
space.</p>
<p>Galaxy Teleportation. Han Sen had practiced his teleportation
abilities for a long time. He had finally practiced Galaxy
Teleportation, but Han Sen had only studied a part of it. He
modified Space Teleportation into a version that was more suitable
for his body.</p>
<p>Because of the Dongxuan Aura’s power buff, Han Sen’s Break Space
Flash was faster than God’s Wander. He used Space Teleportation as
a normal teleportation talent. It was even faster than
short-distance teleportation.</p>
<p>No one expected Han Sen would be able to dodge that slashing
power. Sky Armor God waved the scabbard again. He swung it at Han
Sen. This time, it was stronger and faster. It suddenly ripped
space to appear directly in front of Han Sen.</p>
<p>Han Sen’s body was able to flash away, so the knife light missed
its target.</p>
<p>“How many attacks are you able to evade?” Sky Armor God coldly
asked. He started slashing with the scabbard at an even faster
pace.</p>
<p>Sky Armor God slashed a dozen times. Each slash was faster and
harder than the one before. He was slashing out many purple and
black space cracks, which were like deep trenches in the vastness
of space.</p>
<p>Even so, not a single one of them was able to damage Han
Sen.</p>
<p>“That is a very fast space teleportation skill. It seems faster
than the Very High’s God’s Wander. This Dollar is not an easy
fellow to beat.” Sky Palace Leader was shocked by the
performance.</p>
<p>“God Spirit combined body,” the woman said. “That power can
challenge a true god class and perhaps something even stronger.
Dollar’s Space Teleportation speed can dodge the striking attacks.
That is very rare. It is a shame that evading attacks is ultimately
pointless. He cannot go against the Sky Armor God and slay a god.
He will lose.”</p>
<p>“Going against the Sky Armor God and slaying a god is not easy.
If this was Golden Growler, he might stand a chance of beating the
enemy.” Sky Palace Leader looked at Han Sen and said, “Dollar’s
body fitness is strong, but he is still only butterfly class. If he
could become a true god, perhaps he could stand a chance.”</p>
<p>All the elites of every race understood Han Sen’s situation.
Relying on the unlimited Space Teleportation, he was able to dodge
the Deep Abyss Knight’s attacks. But who knew Space Teleportation
itself cost energy? To keep using Space Teleportation like that
meant he would eventually run out of power. Once that happened, he
was going to lose.</p>
<p>“Dollar’s Space Teleportation is very powerful. It looks like he
can use it whenever and however he wants. He does not need to
prepare time for it, and he can keep using it to move. That is
stronger than the Very High’s God’s Wander.” The Extreme King’s
Second Uncle profusely complimented the talent.</p>
<p>Bai King looked at the space battleground without speaking. His
eyes looked strange. He felt a bit angry. “A God Spirit has
descended to earth. He took the Deep Abyss Knight’s body. They are
getting more ballsy.”</p>
<p>Bai King recognized Sky Armor God. After all, his power had been
able to combine with the Return Empty Scabbard. It was too easy to
guess the identity of the villain.</p>
<p>It did not matter who was king of the Extreme King at the time.
Any of them would have despised Sky Armor God. The same applied to
Bai King. If he was able to strike, he would want to be like Knife
King and cut out Sky Armor God’s bones again.</p>
<p>Sky Armor God thought Space Teleportation required a lot of
power. All he had to do was slash a few more times to make Han Sen
exhausted. When he could no longer use Space Teleportation, he
could kill him.</p>
<p>Han Sen kept using Space Teleportation without reprieve, and he
was showing no signs of slowing down. That surprised Sky Armor
God.</p>
<p>In fact, it was not just Sky Armor God who was surprised. Even
God, who was in the garden, was surprised. “He is continuously
using Space Teleportation, yet his body does not look like it is
getting tired. It is not just his body that is strong. His body
keeps drawing in energy from the universe to keep his energy
reserves full. The Very High can barely do something like that even
if they max out Sky and Men Combined Together. He is just a
butterfly and can already do this. Is it a simple talent, or has he
practiced it a lot?”</p>
<p>Ordinary deified creatures were afraid of using too much power,
but Han Sen had four battle bodies that were combined. The Dongxuan
Battle Body was able to keep on absorbing energy directly from the
universe. It kept providing him with energy. If Han Sen’s body did
not collapse, he could fight endlessly. He did not have to worry
about exhaustion.</p>
<p>Sky Armor God saw the problem. He coldly grunted. “In that case,
I will make you stop hiding.”</p>
<p>The scabbard slashed out like a shadow. Many knife lights
created a crack in space. He was going to trap Han Sen inside a
space crack.</p>
<p>Space Teleportation was actually a space movement. If Sky Armor
God cracked the space around Han Sen, he would be totally
disconnected from it. Even if Han Sen had his powerful Space
Teleportation skill, he could not escape it.</p>
<p>Han Sen kept teleporting. More cracks were showing up in space,
so there were fewer places for him to teleport to.</p>
<p>The space battleground was not the real universe. It was just an
area of space. Its power was limited. Han Sen did not have enough
space to move around freely.</p>
<p>Han Sen did not expect to keep running around forever.
Teleporting was a way for him to observe. He wanted to learn about
Sky Armor God’s power. He did not know anything about Sky Armor
God. People needed to know their enemy, so Han Sen had to learn
about Sky Armor God.</p>
<p>Han Sen had slain two gods. He did not mind doing it again, but
he needed to make sure it was a success. He could not blindly
attack and end up dying.</p>
<p>“Where are you running to?” Sky Armor God kept slashing. Purple
and black knife lights kept cutting space up, producing the scary
space cracks.</p>
<p>Han Sen was now surrounded by space cracks from all directions.
He was trapped in the sole area that had not been broken, but space
there was cut off from the outside. No matter how strong Han Sen’s
Space Teleportation was, he could no longer teleport away.</p>
<p>In Blood Legion, Lou Lie looked at Sky Armor God with fire. He
recognized who Sky Armor God was. “It is over. Dollar is strong,
but fighting a god is too much. It was a shame it was not me
encountering this god. Otherwise, I might have been able to kill
him.”</p>
