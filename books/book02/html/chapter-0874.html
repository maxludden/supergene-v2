    <p>
      Han Sen made plans to travel to Thunder Mountain, but before he left,
      someone came looking for him.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Mister Han, we are from Angel Gene. We would like to request your
      aid in slaying a super creature. Provided you have the time, we are happy
      to discuss the price for such an appeal.&#8221; Zhao Xuebin was one of
      Angel Gene&#8217;s managers, and he smiled as he made the request.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;The Zhao family are indeed shameless. First, they want to kill me;
      now, they want my help.&#8221; Han Sen could not help but laugh in his
      heart. His words told a different story, however, and he responded,
      &#8220;That depends on what super creature you&#8217;re asking me to kill,
      and of course, the price as mentioned.&#8221;
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;If you are willing to help us with this task, then rest assured,
      the price will bring a smile to your face.&#8221; Zhao Xuebin spoke softly
      and paused. After a brief while, he continued on by saying, &#8220;We want
      you to help us kill the Thunderbull that resides on Thunder
      Mountain.&#8221;
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen couldn&#8217;t believe such a coincidence could transpire, as the
      Thunderbull was his target, too.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Sure. It&#8217;ll cost you one hundred high-class Angel Gene
      Fluids,&#8221; Han Sen said, with a puffed-up chest.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Oh, Mister Han! Don&#8217;t you think that price is just a little
      bit unreasonable? You know high-class Angel Gene Fluids require royal
      shura blood for their formulation. Our relationship with the shura is bad
      enough, and so the procurement of this blood is difficult. One hundred
      vials of Angel Gene Fluid is too steep. Besides, we have our own team. We
      only require your assistance; we are not asking you to take on the super
      creature all by yourself.&#8221; Zhao Xuebin blushed, undoubtedly feeling
      rather awkward over the proposition he had to decline.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;You said your offer would bring a smile to my face; one hundred
      vials of Angel Gene Fluid is what that would take. If you can&#8217;t
      oblige my price, then go ask someone else,&#8221; Han Sen said sternly.
    </p>

    <p>
      It was true that the number of vials of Angel Gene Fluid in circulation,
      and available for purchase, was low lately. Rarely could anyone afford to
      buy them, even if they could be found. Han Sen&#8217;s request for one
      hundred of such vials was quite ludicrous, and it would eat out an entire
      month of Angel Gene&#8217;s revenue.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Mister Han, your price is far too high. As much as I would like to,
      I cannot strike you this deal right now, but I will return to the Alliance
      and consult my supervisor,&#8221; Zhao Xuebin suggested.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;I am leaving the shelter one hour from now,&#8221; Han Sen said.
    </p>

    <p>
      Zhao Xuebin nodded and said, &#8220;I&#8217;ll be quick, so please
      wait!&#8221;
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen thought the outrageous price he had suggested would be enough to
      scare them off and have them quit their intrusion. But unfortunately for
      him, Zhao Xuebin came back with a grin. He said, &#8220;Our company
      accepts your price. I have the vials with me, but we&#8217;ll require you
      to sign this contract.&#8221;
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen was surprised, to say the least. He looked over the
      contract&#8217;s contents and everything seemed to be in order. He looked
      at the crate of Angel Gene Fluid, and noticed it had been stamped with
      their proper, official seal. If what was included within was not what he
      had requested, or if the Angel Gene Fluid inside the vials was a cheap
      knock-off or a diluted variant of the liquid, he would be able to sue
      them.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Okay.&#8221; Han Sen signed the contract and accepted the hundred
      vials of Angel Gene Fluid.
    </p>

    <p>
      When Han Sen left, a middle-aged man approached Zhao Xuebin and said,
      &#8220;Manager Zhao, one hundred vials of high-class Angel Gene Fluid is
      far too expensive.&#8221;
    </p>

    <p>
      Zhao Xuebin shook his head and replied, &#8220;It&#8217;s not as expensive
      as you think. We are unable to kill the bull ourselves, unfortunately; so,
      we have no choice but to ask him. He is the only person who owns a super
      pet right now, after all.&#8221;
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;But again, this is one hundred high-class vials of Angel Gene
      Fluid. Couldn&#8217;t we use those ourselves to kill the
      Thunderbull?&#8221; Liu Gui pleaded.
    </p>

    <p>
      Zhao Xuebin laughed and said, &#8220;This Thunderbull can unleash AOE
      strikes. Even if we did manage to kill it, we&#8217;d incur far too many
      losses of personnel. We can lose the liquid, but we cannot lose our
      people. Asking Han Sen to do this, regardless of the price, is better for
      our future prosperity. We can always synthesize more of this liquid; it is
      only material.&#8221;
    </p>

    <p>
      Lui Gui nodded and did not say anything further, as it wasn&#8217;t his
      place to make such decisions, anyway.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Go and get yourself ready; we will depart alongside Han Sen soon.
      The slaying of this Thunderbull will be good for us, and if the boy does
      happen to fail, then he&#8217;ll have to return the vials of Angel Gene
      Fluid to us, anyway. It will be even better for us, if he ends up
      grievously wounded.&#8221; The dark light of murder flickered from Zhao
      Xuebin&#8217;s eyes.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen sent the Angel Gene Fluid back to the Alliance, allowing Ji Yanran
      to hold onto it. There was no chance he&#8217;d be returning that crate.
    </p>

    <p>
      And in regards to the Thunderbull, he did not believe Angel Gene would
      make an honest deal. But if he could slay the creature, obtain the loot,
      and walk away with the fluid he had been offered, it was worth going with
      them.
    </p>

    <p>
      Anyway, Han Sen did not feel bad about doing bad things to the people of
      Angel Gene, if push came to shove.
    </p>

    <p>
      With Zero in tow, Han Sen went to rendezvous with the members of Angel
      Gene who were going to accompany him.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Mister Han, we are off to hunt a super creature. Are you sure it is
      appropriate of you to bring along a beautiful little girl?&#8221; Zhao
      Xuebin mockingly suggested, upon laying eyes on Zero.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;It is only a super creature; she&#8217;ll be fine.&#8221; Han Sen
      said, as he stroked Zero&#8217;s head.
    </p>

    <p>
      When Zhao Xuebin and Lui Gui heard what he said, they choked on their
      words of rebuttal. They believed Han Sen was far too arrogant for his own
      good, but they held their tongues.
    </p>

    <p>
      They brought eight people to accompany Han Sen on their journey to the
      mountain where they&#8217;d fight the bull.
    </p>

    <p>
      Zero followed Han Sen from behind as usual, and it didn&#8217;t seem as if
      the events that transpired in the Dark Haunted Forest had affected her in
      the slightest. She just continued to follow him, with greater accuracy
      than his own shadow.
    </p>

    <p>
      It started to rain, and the road grew muddy and tough. But to the
      collective that scaled the lands past the safety of the shelter, it was
      nothing.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen, riding Golden Growler, summoned Spirit Owl to fly above them and
      shield Zero from the rain.
    </p>

    <p>
      The area was stuffed with dark storm clouds, and thunder rolled
      unceasingly. It was so loud that it muffled the sound of all else. And
      behind the clouds, the distant lightshow of flickering lightning bolts
      played out rhythmically.
    </p>

    <p>
      The silver fox seemed very excited, and he jumped on top of Golden
      Growler&#8217;s head. He looked off into the distance, peering at Thunder
      Mountain. His eyes surveyed the lands, as if it was looking for something
      in particular.
    </p>

    <p>Boom!</p>

    <p>
      A lightning bolt streaked across the skies like the forming of a spider
      web, illuminating the wet, darkened land.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen used the light to view the black peak they were headed towards. It
      was higher than any other mountain in the area, and it was so tall it was
      as if it connected to the very sky itself.
    </p>

    <p>
      All of the lightning seemed to come from that mountain, as if it was some
      natural, rocky lightning rod.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Mister Han, that is Thunder Mountain, home of the
      Thunderbull,&#8221; Zhao Xuebin said, as he pointed towards the craggy
      peak.
