<p><em>Boom!</em></p>

<p>Amidst the angry roaring, Destroyer Wolf’s head fell to the ground. No matter how loudly it roared, it could not move.</p>

<p>All the super elites were frozen. They were terrified.</p>

<p>They knew how powerful Destroyer Wolf was, but that one little coin was able to bring the beast’s head down to the ground and prevent it from being lifted up.</p>

<p>Han Sen’s mystique rose even higher in their hearts.</p>

<p>As those watching were still reeling in shock, Han Sen placed the stone pipe to his lips. Then, he blew down at the wolf. It flashed red, and then that light went straight into the wolf’s head, tearing it apart.</p>

<p>“Berserk Super Creature Destroyer Wolf killed. Destroyer Wolf beast soul has been obtained. Geno core unobtained. Flesh inedible. Collect its Life Geno Essence to receive zero to ten super geno points randomly.”</p>

<p>Han Sen was delighted. He had managed to earn another berserk super beast soul.</p>

<p>The other super elites, seeing the Destroyer Wolf’s head split open, looked stunned. They all turned to look at Han Sen as he went forward to the body that was fading away. Their foreheads started to produce a cold sweat.</p>

<p>Han Sen grabbed the Life Geno Essence that the wolf’s corpse had left behind and then turned to look at the super elites. After that, he disappeared.</p>

<p>When Han Sen disappeared in mid-air, the super elites all felt a grand wash of relief. The mounting pressure they had experienced finally began to lift.</p>

<p>That did not mean Han Sen was powerful. They merely thought Han Sen was powerful. Killing Destroyer Wolf was something unimaginably scary. Of course, they were just scaring themselves more than anything. The pressure they felt was unwarranted.</p>

<p>“This is scary! Who was that? Was that the alpha of some race?”</p>

<p>“I have never heard about him before. It looked like a spirit, though.”</p>

<p>“I thought it looked like a creature, personally.”</p>

<p>“No, that was a spirit.”</p>

<p>“Bullshit! That was a creature.”</p>

<p>“Did you guys see the stone pipe he used to slay Destroyer Wolf? It looked like Drink Blood Emperor’s Blow Blood geno core.”</p>

<p>“It did look like it, yes.”</p>

<p>“It didn’t just look like it. That was it, for sure! I saw Drink Blood Emperor use it once.”</p>

<p>“I thought emperor class elites couldn’t open it once it was sealed. How did he manage to activate it?”</p>

<p>“The power to open that geno core is not something we can comprehend.”</p>

<p>Goddess looked to the point where Han Sen vanished. Her beautiful eyes looked strange, and she said, “When did such a powerful being come to exist here?”</p>

<p>Yu Miao looked in that direction, too. She couldn’t tell it was Han Sen, however.</p>

<p>Gu Qingcheng merely frowned. The power that had been forcibly taken from her had now been returned, and she was surprised.</p>

<p>“What a weird power. Who is he?” Gu Qingcheng could not tell it was Han Sen, either.</p>

<p>Xu Mi looked on in admiration, and he said, “That person is so strong! I wonder what race he is. I should have asked him.”</p>

<p>As the crowds began to leave, conversations started to revolve around Han Sen. The image of Han Sen as a super king spirit was now all over the Fourth God’s Sanctuary, and they really wanted to find out who he was.</p>

<p>No one knew who it was until humans from the Third God’s Sanctuary came, claiming to have seen him before. They recognized him.</p>

<p>“That was Dollar! Our human Dollar!”</p>

<p>“Dollar is strong! So many super creatures and king spirits were unable to bring down Destroyer Wolf, and he killed it in a flash. That’s pretty scary.”</p>

<p>“Wherever Dollar goes, he is strong.”</p>

<p>“Dollar is like a god.”</p>

<p>“He is finally here.”</p>

<p>The creatures and spirits did not believe it was a human. They did not think it was possible for this Dollar to be a human, but strangely, only humans seemed to recognize him. No others did.</p>

<p>No matter what the case might have been, however, Dollar’s name was spoken all across the Fourth God’s Sanctuary. All the factions spoke about him, but no one knew much about him. His identity and location were unknown.</p>

<p>The saddest being in the sanctuary, at the time, must have been Ghost Eye. He had ever expected that Han Sen would be able to unseal Blow Blood. Seeing Blow Blood’s ability to kill strong creatures such as Destroyer Wolf, Ghost Eye’s eyes were now bleeding.</p>

<p>Han Sen left the battleground and found a place with no one around to see him deactivate his super king spirit mode. He returned to the image of his real self, and then circled back to Rolling Dragon Lake. Then, he went into the underwater cave.</p>

<p>He wanted to see if the dead woman from the Sacred egg was still there. If the body had remained, it would be a shame to waste it. The woman was dead and the flesh was just a vessel. It would be a good deed to benefit from the death of another creature.</p>

<p>Han Sen, thinking this, then entered the underwater cave. After looking inside the cave, he was surprised to see the body was actually gone.</p>

<p>“Was she like Destroyer Wolf and couldn’t be eaten? Did she just disappear when she died?” Han Sen frowned.</p>

<p>Normally, if the flesh of super creatures was inedible, they’d just disappear. But she hadn’t, as far as he’d seen. This one confused him.</p>

<p>Han Sen poked around for a bit and even used his weapons to swing around in the Black Pond. He found nothing, though. He left the underwater cave then, to meet up with Gu Qingcheng.</p>

<p>Blood Feet Beast was traveling across the mountains at the time, in a very angry mood. He was a super creature, but he hadn’t received any benefits from the killing of the wolf. He was also injured.</p>

<p>As he was walking, he saw a small creature that was flapping its black wings. Blood Feet Beast was hungry, so it ran up to it and tried to eat the creature.</p>

<p>Before Blood Feet Beast pounced, the small body raised a black bow. The sound of a plucked string rang through the air, accompanying the flight of a black arrow that punched a hole through the creature’s head.</p>

<p>Pang!</p>

<p>Blood Feet Beast’s head and body blew up. It was very dead. The small creature did not look back. It just flapped its wings and left the area.</p>

<p>If Han Sen was there, he’d have recognized that creature. That small creature was the woman from the Sacred egg.</p>
