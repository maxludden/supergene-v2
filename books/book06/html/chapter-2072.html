<p>After returning home, Han Sen spent some time thinking about
capturing the red cloud. It seemed likely that petrification or
freezing abilities would be effective against the red cloud.</p>
<p>But his own petrifying shockwave was no match for the red
cloud’s speed. Even if Han Sen teleported right next to the beast,
the red cloud could still react fast enough to avoid the shockwave.
Its ability to accelerate seemed almost endless.</p>
<p>“But the petrifying shockwave is a power obtained from refining
a mutant xenogeneic gene. I need to follow its rigid terms of use
to cast it. I can’t use it with knife silks. If I could, it might
be a lot more useful.”</p>
<p>Han Sen was rapidly becoming obsessed with catching that cocky
red cloud.</p>
<p>Turtle did not work on it. Han Sen had tried, but the Turtle
image just wouldn’t stick to the clouds. When the clouds spread,
the Turtle spell would just come off. There were no better methods
for applying it, either.</p>
<p>“If my Jadeskin had a freezing power, and I could put the
Jadeskin godlight into the knife silks, I could possibly tie it up
and make it into an ice cube. Jadeskin’s godlight possesses the
element of ice, but it doesn’t possess a powerful freezing
ability.” Han Sen was starting to feel depressed.</p>
<p>He still couldn’t think of a way to catch the red cloud. He had
no choice but to wait until he could think of a good way to catch
it.</p>
<p>The next day, Han Sen picked up Blood Feather Knife and went to
visit the tenth elder. Han Sen wasn’t going there to meet with him
explicitly, though; more than anything, he was there to see Yun
Suyi.</p>
<p>He had absorbed all of the mutant blood and returned the blade
to its normal state. It was now a bona fide half-deified treasure.
With some further refinements, there was every chance it could
become a fully-fledged deified weapon.</p>
<p>Han Sen wanted to swap the Blood Feather Knife for his Ghost
Teeth Knife. He needed to talk about it with Yun Suyi.</p>
<p>But Han Sen thought that if Yun Suyi had the knife, it would be
best if he spoke to her father, Yun Changkong, as well. If Yun
Changkong could not refine the deified weapon, he might have to ask
for the leader’s help.</p>
<p>When Han Sen went to see the Yun family, Yun Suyi and Yun
Sushang were both there. Thousand Feather Crane was out hunting
xenogeneics, and he had not yet returned.</p>
<p>“Sister Yun, thank you for lending me your Blood Feather Knife.
I’ve come to return it. There is, however, something I need to tell
you first.” Han Sen presented the knife to Yun Suyi. “I absorbed
the xenogeneic blood. I am sorry I could not tell you about this
any sooner.”</p>
<p>Yun Suyi and Yun Sushang were both shocked. The Blood Feather
Knife was famous because it was the blood that had always
prohibited it from becoming deified. If Han Sen really had removed
the mark, then it had a chance of becoming deified again.</p>
<p>Yun Suyi accepted the knife and inspected it. The blood really
was gone. The knife was as clean as a glossy feather.</p>
<p>“How did you do that?” Yun Suyi asked Han Sen with visible
shock.</p>
<p>The Feather had tried every method they could think of to remove
the blood on the knife, but each attempt had ended in failure. If
they knew removing the blood was possible, they’d have never given
the knife away. Han Sen seemed to only possess the powers of an
Earl or a Marquise, so she had no clue how he might have done
this.</p>
<p>“Mutant blood meshes well with my geno art, so I was able to
absorb it,” Han Sen explained.</p>
<p>“Brother Han, this is a great service. If the Feather knew about
this, they’d be furious.” Yun Sushang, overhearing them talk,
sighed.</p>
<p>“It was all down to luck,” Han Sen said with a grin.</p>
<p>Yun Suyi took the Ghost Teeth Knife from her waist and returned
it to Han Sen. Her fingers lingered on the blade, though, and it
seemed like she’d miss it. “I have not used it for long, so I can’t
believe I am already giving it back.”</p>
<p>“But now you have the Blood Feather Knife, which is greater than
the Ghost Teeth Knife,” Han Sen said, as he took Ghost Teeth Knife
back.</p>
<p>The Blood Feather Knife was strong, but Han Sen was more
comfortable with the Ghost Teeth Knife. It complemented his
abilities.</p>
<p>“It’s different.” Yun Suyi shook her head, but did not say
anything more. She didn’t sound happy about the prospect of the
Blood Feather Knife’s potential.</p>
<p>Just as Han Sen expected, Yun Changkong took the Blood Feather
Knife to the Sky Palace leader. The leader, in turn, passed it on
to the folks at Sky Path Garden. He allowed them to work on it, in
the hopes of making it deified again.</p>
<p>This news spread all across Sky Palace. According to the
research results, there was an 80% chance it could become deified
again.</p>
<p>Sky Palace was fervently excited. Even the nobles of Sky Palace
seemed giddy. Millennia might pass without a new deified weapon
turning up.</p>
<p>But Angia, and certain others in Sky Palace, weren’t as joyful.
They did not look good.</p>
<p>“It’s Han Sen again!” Angia growled.</p>
<p>All the races guarded their deified weapons jealously. This one
should have belonged to the Feather, but it now belonged to Sky
Palace. The Feather in Holy Heaven heard what had happened, too.
They all looked upset, and it was difficult to determine if they
were shocked or just mad.</p>
<p>Han Sen found the opportunity to return to the sanctuaries
again. There, he hugged his cute wife and daughter.</p>
<p>“Dad, I want a hug too.” Bao’er approached, looking at Han
Sen.</p>
<p>Han Sen held one child in each arm. He felt happy. It would have
been perfect if Littleflower was still around.</p>
<p>The next morning, Han Sen prepared to return to Sky Palace. But
just as he was about to, Bao’er jumped into his arms and said,
“Dad, I want to go with you.”</p>
<p>You still need to go to school. I will take you when you grow
up,” Han Sen said.</p>
<p>“Huh! If you’re not taking me, then I will find my own way
there,” Bao’er said defiantly, much to Han Sen’s surprise.</p>
<p>“You have a way of getting there?” Han Sen asked. Bao’er wasn’t
an ordinary child, so there was a chance she might have actually
found a way there.</p>
<p>“I’m not telling you. Since you’re not taking me, I will go
there myself,” Bao’er said flatly</p>
<p>“Bao’er, it’s not that I don’t want to take you. It’s because I
cannot take you. Just wait a little while, until I’m back on Planet
Eclipse. I will take you there then, okay?” Han Sen said quickly,
trying to comfort her. He didn’t want her to do anything rash.</p>
<p>Han Sen couldn’t take her there yet. Sky Palace wouldn’t allow
the presence of a random outsider. If someone saw her, it’d be hard
to explain.</p>
<p>“Fine, but you cannot lie to me. If this is a lie, I will still
go there my own way.” Bao’er held out her finger for a pinky
promise.</p>
<p>“I promise you. I will take you there when I return to Planet
Eclipse,” Han Sen said seriously. He hooked her little pinky with
his own, and then he touched her thumbs.</p>
<p>Bao’er believed Han Sen, and so she jumped out of his arms.</p>
<p>Han Sen suddenly thought of something. “Bao’er, the items that
you sucked inside the little gourd. Can they be released?”</p>
<p>“Yeah.” Bao’er blinked.</p>
