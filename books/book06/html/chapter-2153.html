<p>“How could it have vanished?” Han Sen mumbled in confusion.</p>
<p>The Sun Raven was a baby, but it was a deified creature from the
geno universe. Its deified genes were so stable that Han Sen was
unable to absorb them. It would be pointless for a creature in the
Alliance to steal it.</p>
<p>On top of that, that entire place belonged to Han Sen. Many
scary creatures lived there, and they could take over the entire
Alliance if he wanted them to. Who would dare to steal anything
from him?</p>
<p>Han Sen wouldn’t make the mistake of forgetting where he had put
the body, but he didn’t think it had been stolen, either. It was
too large to move easily anyway.</p>
<p>When Han Sen first got the Sun Raven body, he had been unable to
absorb it. So, he had kept it inside the warehouse for safekeeping.
Over the past two years, he hadn’t looked at it once. With so much
time having gone by, he didn’t even know when it had gone
missing.</p>
<p>Han Sen used his Dongxuan Aura to scan the area, but there was
no trace of the bird’s body. Its body was very solid, and by all
accounts, it should have left behind some sort of sign.</p>
<p>Fortunately, the warehouse was equipped with cameras. Han Sen
headed for a control room where he could view the camera feeds, but
suddenly, Bao’er leaped off of Han Sen’s shoulders and ran to a
specific corner of the warehouse.</p>
<p>Han Sen quickly understood that Bao’er had found something, and
so he followed after her. Bao’er had gone to a wooden crate. She
climbed atop it and looked inside.</p>
<p>Han Sen recalled that the crate had been used to store barrels
of wine that Ji Yanran had bought. They had been produced on a
famous vineyard planet, but since the wine required a rare
ingredient that the makers could no longer obtain, the wine’s
production had ceased.</p>
<p>Ji Yanran had taken the crates there to collect what she could.
They did not drink together very often, and so they were just kept
in storage when not needed. The open crate was evidence that
someone had been there.</p>
<p>And on top of that, a few other crates were open as well.</p>
<p>“There really has been a theft?” Han Sen moved over to Bao’er
and inspected the crates.</p>
<p>Han Sen saw a tall black barrel that had also been opened. It
had been drained of the wine it previously contained, but when Han
Sen looked inside, he saw the last thing he expected to see.</p>
<p>There was not a single drop of alcohol remaining, but at the
bottom of the container was a fist-sized egg. Its shell was red,
and it looked very beautiful.</p>
<p>Han Sen used his Dongxuan Aura to scan the item, and from the
red egg, he could discern something that felt very familiar. He
could tell that it belonged to the little red bird that used to
follow Bao’er around.</p>
<p>After thinking about this, Han Sen realized he hadn’t seen or
heard much about the little bird over the past couple of years. He
had been too busy, and the bird tended to follow Bao’er anyway, so
he hadn’t spared it much attention.</p>
<p>Han Sen picked up the egg from the empty keg, and after a keener
inspection, he was able to tell that it did indeed contain a
presence that belonged to the little red bird.</p>
<p>“Weird. Why would it be here? And why would it become an egg?”
Han Sen wondered about this, and then he looked at Bao’er.</p>
<p>Bao’er shook her head, indicating that she had no clue,
either.</p>
<p>The little red bird had a strange history. When they first found
it, it was in the Phoenix Nirvana. It had been in its Sunfish form
at the time, but when it left the water of the pool, it transformed
into a little red bird. It was certainly a strange creature.</p>
<p>Because the little red bird did not have attacking power, Han
Sen quickly stopped paying attention to it. He allowed Bao’er to
keep the thing as a pet.</p>
<p>Now that the little red bird had come to the warehouse, and it
had apparently drained an entire barrel of wine and turned into an
egg, it all seemed rather strange.</p>
<p>Han Sen brought the egg that the little red bird had become to
the security room. He had three years of footage to peruse, and so
he started watching them on fast forward.</p>
<p>After a while, Han Sen saw motion on the monitor. Around two
years ago, not long after he brought the Sun Raven’s body to the
warehouse, the little red bird flew in and began eating it.</p>
<p>Although Han Sen had been unable to refine the Sun Raven’s body,
the little red bird munched on it with no problem. But it had only
been able to eat a small amount of it each time. The little bird
was like a woodpecker, and after a whole year of nibbling, the
entire body was consumed.</p>
<p>As it ate the Sun Raven’s body, the little red bird underwent a
metamorphosis that changed its body continually over the course of
the year. Eventually, its body became a red crystal that burned
with a constant flame.</p>
<p>After the little red bird ate the entire Sun Raven’s body, it
flew towards one of the crates and opened it, then pulled the top
off a barrel. The little guy splashed down into the alcohol and
became a little red fish. The fire that enveloped it was
extinguished, but the heat must have vaporized the alcohol
inside.</p>
<p>Within a few minutes, the barrel was as dry as a bone.</p>
<p>And then, the little red bird came out of the egg. It went into
each and every barrel and did the same, ruining the whole supply of
alcohol.</p>
<p>After the little red bird reached the final barrel, it hadn’t
emerged again until Han Sen came along and took it.</p>
<p>“Damn! What is this thing? It ate the sun Sun Raven and
evolved.” Han Sen looked at the egg in his hand in shock.</p>
<p>Han Sen was unable to refine the deified body, so it was
difficult to imagine how the little red bird had done so.</p>
<p>“Whatever. I couldn’t refine the body, anyway. I just hope that
whatever it becomes will be something of moderate usefulness.”
Ultimately, Han Sen decided to put the red egg back.</p>
<p>Han Sen did not know what it might take for the creature to
successfully incubate, but if it had selected that place by its own
volition, then that was probably the best bet.</p>
<p>Han Sen rested at home for the next few days. He didn’t return
to the Metal World just yet. He did, however, worry about Yuya.
Unfortunately, there was nothing he could do about that right now.
He only hoped that the others had found safety after escaping the
giant metal city.</p>
<p>Han Sen held Han Ling’er while Bao’er sat next to him. The three
of them watched movies and ate snacks. Han Ling’er was holding a
milk bottle which she drank from, just like Bao’er used to do when
she was younger.</p>
<p>Ji Yanran returned from the company and its business, and there,
she saw Han Sen and Bao’er asleep on the couch. Han Ling’er was
asleep atop Han Sen with a pacifier in her mouth. There were snacks
and toys everywhere.</p>
<p>“Seriously? This is how you choose to be a father?” Ji Yanran
complained, but she did so with a light-hearted smile. She didn’t
wake them up, either. She draped a blanket across them and tidied
up.</p>
<p>Four days later, Han Sen went back to the warehouse where Metal
Eater resided. He planned on taking Metal Eater with him now, in
the hopes that he could negotiate with the Metal Beast if he
encountered it again.</p>
<p>Just in case, Han Sen summoned the dragon wings on his back and
the dragon wings attached to his ears. If something went wrong, he
could teleport away with Metal Eater and gain enough space to
escape back to the sanctuaries again. Being alive was more
important than anything else.</p>
