      Tang Rubei’s nickname was Ghost Hand. He called himself the best thief,
      and through the employ of state-of-the-art technology, he hadn’t once
      botched a job in over sixty years.
    </p>
    <p>
      Someone had paid him a high price to steal Han Sen’s son Littleflower, and
      that was why he was on Planet Roca. He waited until everyone was gone
      before breaking in to complete his objective.
    </p>
    <p>
      “People these days are way too naive. They rely on robots to do everything
      for them. Even a rookie thief could get this job done without breaking a
      sweat.” Tang Rubei was speaking out loud to himself, as he stepped towards
      Littleflower.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Do you want some ice cream, little girl?” Smiling warmly, Tang Rubei
      offered a Blue Gemstone ice cream.
    </p>
    <p>
      The client had informed him that Bao’er was not a real human, just a pet
      beast soul. It didn’t fight, and it loved nothing more than ice cream.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Uncle, you’re a good man,” Bao’er told him, gleefully accepting the ice
      cream.
    </p>
    <p>
      Tang Rubei thought to himself, “This is what you call true talent. If I
      admit I am the second-best thief in the universe, no one would be the
      first.”
    </p>
    <p>
      As Bao’er licked away at her ice cream, Tang Rubei gently moved to pick up
      Littleflower and said, “Little Baby, let me take you someplace fun.”
    </p>
    <p>
      But before he could lay his fingers on the baby, he felt something touch
      his clothes with the zap of an electrical current. He promptly turned
      around to see what the issue was.
    </p>
    <p>
      His senses were excellent, and he had not detected the presence of anyone
      else in the house. But strangely, his clothes were still being pulled. He
      had not been caught once across all the years he’d been active, and if he
      was to fail now, his image and reputation would be forever tarnished.
    </p>
    <p>After turning around, he noticed Bao’er was staring at him intently.</p>
    <p>
      “Pah! I knew no one would have gotten home that soon.” Tang Rubei sighed,
      seeing no one else there. His heart had almost leaped out of his chest.
    </p>
    <p>
      “You continue eating your ice cream, kiddo.” Tang Rubei smiled at Bao’er
      and went to pick up Littleflower again.
    </p>
    <p>
      His clothing was tugged again, and when he turned to take a look, Bao’er
      told him, “I finished my ice cream. I want some more.”
    </p>
    <p>
      Tang Rubei felt a headache coming on. Although Han Sen would not know what
      the pet beast soul was up to or how she was treated, if Tang Rubei
      attacked her, there was a chance Han Sen might realize something was up no
      matter where he was.
    </p>
    <p>
      To avoid Han Sen’s wrath, Tang Rubei thought it was best not to attack
      Bao’er.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bao’er was not technically his beast soul, anyway. The chances he’d find
      out were low, regardless.
    </p>
    <p>
      “It is true that the rich are selfish. I’d let such a cute humanoid pet
      eat whatever she desired. Han Sen’s family has no doubt been cheap on
      her,” Tang Rubei thought. He then opened the mini fridge attached to his
      waist and gave her two more ice creams.
    </p>
    <p>
      Tang Rubei liked being prepared, so he had brought three ice cream bars
      with him, just in case. He gave the remaining two to her and said, “Go
      eat.”
    </p>
    <p>
      In a flash, Bao’er gobbled up the ice cream bars and immediately
      proclaimed, “Uncle, I want more!”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Won’t you get sick, eating that much ice cream?” Tang Rubei had only
      brought three and had no more to give her. “I have run out of ice cream, I
      am sorry. If you stay here, I’ll go and bring you some more later.” Tang
      Rubei was reaching down to pick up Littleflower as he said this.
    </p>
    <p>“Uncle, take me to get some now.” Bao’er tugged at his clothes.</p>
    <p>
      Tang Rubei wished to ignore her, but he realized his hand was incapable of
      reaching any further to pick up Littleflower.
    </p>
    <p>
      He turned around and was in shock. Bao’er had latched onto him, and she
      was so strong, he found himself incapable of moving.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Is she a high-class pet beast soul that’s in battle mode? This was not
      mentioned in the mission dossier at all!” Tang Rubei was in shock.
      Fortunately, he was very experienced, so he smiled and told Bao’er, “I’ll
      go buy them now, then. Let’s bring your brother along for the ride. We’ll
      all go together, okay?”
    </p>
    <p>“Okay! You really are a nice man,” Bao’er happily told him.</p>
    <p>
      “Let’s go now. If we don’t hurry, the shops will close.” Tang Rubei turned
      back around to pick up Littleflower, but again, he was stopped by Bao’er.
    </p>
    <p>“Uncle, I can’t go.” Bao’er looked rather bitter this time.</p>
    <p>“Why not? Do you not want ice cream?” Tang Rubei rushed his dialogue.</p>
    <p>
      “I do want it, but if I don’t finish my homework, my parents will yell at
      me.” Bao’er had her finger pointed at the books in front of her.
    </p>
    <p>
      Han Sen wanted Bao’er to learn about the Alliance. He wanted her to live
      there instead of the sanctuary, as civilization seemed to suit her a lot
      more.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Parents these days are ridiculous! They even get their pets to do
      homework? Sheesh. Let me help you.” What Tang Rubei said was in support of
      Bao’er, but inside, he thought to himself, “If I wait for you to finish,
      Ji Yanran will be back.”
    </p>
    <p>“Uncle, you are a good man.” Bao’er was touched.</p>
    <p>
      “Yes, I am.” Tang Rubei picked up the book and pen and said, “In the farm,
      there are sixty-seven animals. There are twice as many ducks as there are
      chickens…”
    </p>
    <p>
      Tang Rubei scrawled a bunch of non-sensical answers, planning to leave
      swiftly.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Good uncle, this is wrong.” Bao’er pointed down to the answers he had
      made up.
    </p>
    <p>
      “I deliberately wrote it incorrectly, just so I could test you. Very
      good!” Tang Rubei was getting glum, realizing he might have to do the
      homework for real.
    </p>
    <p>
      “What is this? I’m a master thief! I shouldn’t be reduced to doing baby
      mathematics.” Tang Rubei’s facial expressions turned bitter as he resumed
      doing the math.
