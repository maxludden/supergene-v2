  The Stunning Soul-Taking Eye was the highest-class geno art that the Foxes possessed, and learning the skill required the talents of a Fox’s eyes.

A thousand different people could be polled on a single subject, and they would most likely give a thousand different responses. Everyone’s interests, opinions, and desires were unique. So, it was all very possible for certain people to fall in love with people that others would deem to be ugly. For both men and women, love-at-first-sight was a very important concept.

When a Fox made use of the Stunning Soul-Taking Eye, it would allow the Fox to capture the desires of their target. They would look perfect in the eyes of their prey, like a dream come true.

So, no matter what Fox Queen did, her target would believe her to be absolutely perfect. Every movement was soul-snaring, too alluring to be denied or escaped from.

The amazing thing was that the skill wouldn’t deprive the target of their will. The target simply became captivated by the woman they saw. It was the woman of the target’s dreams, after all.

Han Sen stared at Fox Queen in surprise. Today, Fox Queen was looking exceptionally beautiful. But at the same time, she looked the same as she always did. Her eyes had just become intoxicating, and her beauty was making it difficult to breathe.

“Today, you look remarkably special.” As Han Sen looked at Fox Queen, his expression softened.

“What would you say is remarkably special?” Fox Queen smiled.

Han Sen smiled back, his cheeks coloring slightly as he did so. His eyes brightened.

“Very beautiful,” Han Sen managed to say, after a moment of thought. He couldn’t think of an adequate way to describe the beauty of Fox Queen right now, and so that was all he could fumble out.

“Was I not beautiful prior to this?” Fox Queen spoke evilly.

“You were always pretty, but today you look extra beautiful. There is something different…” As Han Sen spoke, he looked very nervous.

It was like he had been thrust back to his days of first love. The first time he spoke to the girl he had a crush on. It was a feeling that made his heart pound. It was so strong, like his heart was actually trying to leap out of his chest.

“Do you like how I look right now?” Fox Queen asked, as she stared right at Han Sen.

“I like it.” Han Sen gulped.

“Then why are you still standing there?” Fox Queen turned her body to lay on her side, and as she did, she loosened her robe. She revealed her soft shoulders and delicate legs.

“I… I…” Han Sen’s face was extremely red. He didn’t know where to place his eyes or his hands.

Fox Queen took deep, satisfied breaths, and she thought to herself, “No matter how strong your will is, beneath my Stunning Soul-Taking Eye, you won’t even be able to resist the temptation to suck my toes.”

Han Sen seemed as shy as a nervous virgin, and Fox Queen stood up and walked before him. She raised his hands and brought them up to brush the soft skin of her face. She rubbed her face against Han Sen’s hands, and stared at the man lasciviously.

Although Fox Queen did not say anything out loud, her eyes spoke on her behalf.

If Han Sen’s face got any redder, it was going to start bleeding. He mustered the courage to hold her stunning face with two hands. He nibbled his lips. It looked as if he greatly desired to kiss her, but he did not dare to.

Fox Queen closed her eyes and raised her pretty face, like a princess waiting for her prince. That pretty face now seemed to suggest that Han Sen could do anything he wished to.

Feeling Han Sen’s deep breathing and hot body, Fox Queen felt as cocky as she did disappointed. She had beaten Han Sen so quickly, and the interest she had in him seemed to evaporate.

Fox Queen was thinking of new ways in which she could play with him when he fell fully under her spell. She wanted to see what ways she could make him suffer for her.

“Maybe I’ll tie him up when he loses control. That would be an interesting sight,” Fox Queen thought, but Han Sen’s lips were yet to come up to hers.

Pang!

Fox Queen heard a loud noise. And then, Han Sen’s presence just disappeared from right in front of her. She was so shocked that she had no idea what had just happened.

And then, she understood. She opened her eyes and peered at the fish statue. The bindings of the palace were weakened there, and Han Sen and Little Star had slipped right through that tiny gap.

“He ran… he ran… I can’t believe he actually ran…” Fox Queen stood where she was, completely frozen in place. She couldn’t believe Han Sen had actually fled.

Fox Queen hadn’t believed that Han Sen had even a tiny chance of breaking through the walls of the palace, and the way that Han Sen had shrugged off her Stunning Soul-Taking Eye was inconceivable.

When she realized what had just happened, her face darkened with fury. She had just been manipulated. A deified Fox had just been played by a Duke.

Fox Queen wanted to take her anger out on him, but she was unable to: Han Sen had already fled. Even swearing revenge would be utterly pointless, since she still had no way of escaping her cage.

Han Sen combined himself with Little Angel, and after summoning the powers of Jadeskin and the Blood-Pulse Sutra, he used Super Spank to strike the mouth of the fish.

The loosened restriction was widened more and more. He mounted Little Star and escaped the palace right through its mouth. He moved fast, and he didn’t dare to slow down.

It was his best chance to escape. Fox Queen believed him to be under her spell, so she couldn’t react in time to prevent him from leaving.

And just as Han Sen thought, it played out all too smoothly. He almost struggled to believe it had worked out so well.

“I left! It is great to have a beautiful woman with you, but I could not stay there forever.” Han Sen rode Little Star and traveled through the stone. He felt so happy that he started to sing songs. He thought to himself, “I am so talented. I could totally have become an actor. If I ever plan to make a movie, Little Li would have to work for an additional fifty years to become worthy of my film.”

Han Sen allowed Little Star to follow the metal pipe out. He would return to the underground cave system before thinking about what to do next.

Quickly, Little Star took Han Sen back to the underground river. Little Star deactivated its Starsea Travel ability, and its body regained its corporeal form. Han Sen continued to sit comfortably on its back as it swam toward the surface of the river.

Little Star brought Han Sen out of the underground river with a splash, and they floated along the surface.

Han Sen sighed. He looked around, and he froze.

Ice Blue Knight King, Crime, Mister White, Edward, and others were standing on the shore not too far away. Their mouths hung open as they stared at Han Sen, who was still dripping with water. They all looked at each other for three seconds.

It was very quiet, and there was only the sound of the river water to be heard. It was like time was standing still.
