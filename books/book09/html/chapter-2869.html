<h2>Swapping the Sky and Changing the Ground</h2>
<h3>Chapter 2869</h3>

<p>“Just using a hand to flip space and changing fate is very
powerful.” Han Sen felt a chill while watching this. He was
suspicious about this Very High Leader being the person he went
back in time to see. The performance gave people different
feelings. “The Very High Sense practice Sky and Men Combined
Together at an extreme level. It won’t just flip space. It can even
swap galaxies, change the sky, and swap the ground. It is not
difficult, but no one of the Very High has reached that level
before. People can swap a little planet but changing the universe’s
power is impossible.” God paused and went on to say, “For the Very
High to be able to practice to this level is something very rare to
see in their history. Concentrating space into his hands, even god
spirits like Sky Armor God could not do something similar.”</p>
<p>“How do we break that power?” Han Sen asked. He had never seen
power like this before, so he did not know what to do about it.</p>
<p>“In space, his hands will keep energy flowing,” God casually
said. “There are only two ways to get free. One method has you use
your fastest speed to travel faster than a galaxy and escape the
danger space. The other method is to blow up that space, thus
resulting in nothing tying you up.”</p>
<p>Just as God said that, a beast’s roar shocked the sky and shook
the universe. In the space that Very High Leader had clutched,
Golden Growler was getting bigger.</p>
<p>In the eyes of the audience, the space Very High Leader was
holding was just the size of a fist. It was actually an area of
space. Golden Growler’s body was getting bigger. It was filling up
that whole space. Then, there was a pang sound. A scary gold body
blew up the space inside Very High Leader’s hands. It broke out
from the palm, becoming an extremely scary giant gold giant beast.
The planets next to them were as small as a waterdrop.</p>
<p>Roar!</p>
<p>Golden Growler roared. The whole of the god geno list was
shaking. The audience’s hearts were shocked. They felt the roar
exhibit an aura of murder and rage. The creatures without any
courage felt their legs go weak. They fell. The next second, Golden
Growler opened its mouth at Very High Leader. Very High Leader was
so tiny next to Golden Growler. There was no way he was going to
block the big, scary beast’s attack. Very High Leader’s expression
did not change. His hands came together and started spinning. Then,
something unbelievable happened.</p>
<p>It was like Golden Growler’s lower body had a spinning wheel.
Its body weirdly turned 180 degrees. The big mouth that was going
to Very High Leader changed direction.</p>
<p>Golden Growler turned around to bite him again, but Very High
Leader spun his hands. Suddenly, the sky and the earth swapped. He
and Golden Growler swapped positions in space, enabling Golden
Growler’s biting power to miss.</p>
<p>Many creatures watching the fight were frozen, which included
Han Sen. This method to swap the sky and change the ground had
never been heard of before.</p>
<p>“It is no wonder the Very High is the No. 1 race in the big
universe. This method is like God.”</p>
<p>“I would say this is stronger than God. Sky Armor God, who was
killed by Dollar, was nothing much. He was not as powerful as Very
High Leader.” “Not bad. Not bad. Very High Leader is the strongest
person in the universe. That Golden Growler only has invincible
giant power. Is he going to be trapped by Very High Leader?” Upon
seeing this, Han Sen was very shocked. Very High Leader’s skills
were similar to his Dongxuan Area, butt Very High Leader’s power
far exceeded his strength. Han Sen was able to learn something from
Very High Leader’s skill. Very High Leader being able to do this
makes my control of the universal cogwheels more detailed. I should
be able to do the same, but his method is obviously supported by a
geno art. I do not have a geno art. If I am just going to have to
explore this on my own, it will be kind of annoying.</p>
<p>Han Sen felt very conflicted about this. He hoped that Very High
Leader would perform this a few more times so he could learn the
techniques he needed to.</p>
<p>He also wanted Golden Growler to find a way to break it.
Otherwise, being played like that was useless, even if one did have
a lot of power.</p>
<p>“To be able to practice Very High Sense to this extreme, Very
High Leader is not too bad.” God seemed to admire the spectacle,
but that power clearly did not surprise him.</p>
<p>Han Sen’s heart jumped. He looked at God and asked, “Why do I
think Very High Leader is more powerful than Sky Armor God. Is it
an illusion?”</p>
<p>God laughed. “It is not an illusion. Sky Armor God wanted his
god personality back. He forced himself to combine with Deep Abyss
Knight, who was only a butterfly. When Sky Armor God combined with
him, he forced it to true god class. At the end of the day, Deep
Abyss Knight’s body was not enough. Also, Deep Abyss Knight’s
abilities were different from Sky Armor God’s. It was hard for Sky
Armor God to use all of his power. If he combined the true god
class with a body of the same element, it would have been far more
difficult for you to win. But talking about real power here, Very
High Leader might not be weaker than Sky Armor God. To see which is
greater, you would have to wait for Very High Leader to go to the
geno hall. He will have to battle Sky Armor God to find out.”</p>
<p>After God said all that, Han Sen felt nervous.</p>
<p>Golden Growler’s body and power looked very mighty. He was
almost invincible. He was much stronger than Han Sen and Han Sen’s
body now.</p>
<p>Now, he was unable to touch Very High Leader. It did not matter
how strong he was. Golden Growler kept trying to consume Very High
Leader, who kept using his skills to change the sky and swap the
ground. Very High Leader did not move an inch, but Golden Growler
was not even able to ruffle his clothing.</p>
<p>Upon seeing this, Zhang Xuandao complimentarily said, “This old
man is getting stronger.” “After all, he is Very High Leader,” the
woman said. “It is not a surprise to learn he has this sort of
power.”</p>
<p>“It looks like this will be his final fight,” Zhang Xuandao
said. “Successful or not, he will be going to the geno hall very
soon.”</p>
<p>“The Very High have had many people enter the geno hall, but
none ever come back,” the woman said. “Do you think he will be able
to return?” “If I knew that, I would not be just sitting here. I
would have gone to the geno hall and start killing,” Zhang Xuandao
sighed and said, “It is a shame that the rules for the top 100 of
the geno god list are so weird. I thought I could fight him, but I
can only challenge him once. I am afraid I am not going to find
out.”</p>
<p>Golden Growler kept attacking uselessly, so he stopped jumping.
He stood in space, looked at Very High Leader, and ceased
moving.</p>
<p>“You may possess the blood of the growlers, but you cannot win,”
Very High Leader coldly said. “Why don’t you concede and quit?”
“Why are you waiting? Our Little Mountain Leader never loses.” The
green-haired beast was angry. He suddenly thought of something and
said, “This Very High Leader is, admittedly, quite good. The way he
changes the sky and swaps the ground is rare to see in the
universe.”</p>
<p>The woman nearby looked serious. She nodded and said, “The Very
High was able to become a high race not just through sheer luck. It
looks like Little Mountain Leader has to use that skill. I cannot
believe he has to use it in his first fight.</p>
