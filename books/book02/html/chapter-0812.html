    <p>
      Han Sen had gauged the power possessed by Manager Qu and his followers.
      They were not far from the strength of a super creature, but the strength
      they had was not stable. It wasn&#8217;t pure.
    </p>

    <p>
      When they became blood-horn shura, their abilities were akin to that of a
      celestial being. They could unleash elemental projectiles, yes, but they
      were not even able to defeat Han Sen, whose fitness was around two hundred
      and sixty. Their purity and stability were too low, which led to their
      inability to compete.
    </p>

    <p>
      Another thing was their lack of experience with the powers that had been
      bestowed upon them. Whether it was because of a lack of practice with such
      strength, or the inability of the power to be wielded with finesse due to
      the fact that it came from medicine, Han Sen was unsure.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;It looks like I overestimated the power of this shura-liquid-thing.
      It doesn&#8217;t seem to work all that well, after all.&#8221; Han Sen
      threw the Flaming Rex Spike at Manager Qu like a boomerang, and it knocked
      him over. Then, Han Sen pointed at his head and said, &#8220;Answer my
      questions and I&#8217;ll set you free.&#8221;
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Pah! Save your breath; I won&#8217;t tell you anything.&#8221;
      Manager Qu&#8217;s face changed when he spoke. His body began to inflate
      and expand like a balloon.
    </p>

    <p>Boom!</p>

    <p>
      Han Sen jumped away as Manager Qu&#8217;s body exploded like a pinata,
      scattering bits and pieces of his person across the area in a sudden red
      haze. The giblets of Manager Qu then quickly began to rot and fade away
      into nothing.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen&#8217;s face changed, unable to believe a person could so
      completely disregard the importance of their own life. No one willingly
      wanted to die, but Manager Qu&#8217;s behavior made him frown.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;It looks like someone might have done something to them. If not,
      how did that happen?&#8221; Han Sen frowned and looked at where his angel
      and the queen had gone.
    </p>

    <p>
      A while later they came back empty-handed, which disappointed Han Sen. The
      same thing had happened to them; they had attempted to capture the ones
      that fled, but they willing gave themselves up to a sudden, grizzly end.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Who are these people?&#8221; Han Sen frowned. He couldn&#8217;t
      find anything out about their identities, as they were all carrying the
      same gear. Obviously, someone had distributed their wares to them. Finding
      anything out about them seemed hopeless.
    </p>

    <p>
      But Han Sen did manage to get his mitts on a few unused vials of the shura
      liquid. When he returned, he planned to have others research its content
      for him.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen put the vials into his pack and went towards the Empty Vine.
      Roaring and sounds of impact were audible as a big fight ensued.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen kept a low profile, as he returned his little angel and queen.
      Sneakily, he ventured out towards the peak. There, he witnessed the black
      phoenix casting gusts composed of black fire as it flapped its wings
      towards the vine.
    </p>

    <p>
      But the flames did not travel far, as a green elephant raised its trunk
      and blew out lime-colored water to douse them.
    </p>

    <p>
      Around the peak, another eight super creatures stood guard. They prevented
      the approach of any and all other creatures.
    </p>

    <p>
      On the peak, a man with long, sharp ears stood tall. His eyes were red,
      and he was dressed in a black robe. He stood right beside the four Empty
      Fruit, patiently waiting for them to finish ripening.
    </p>

    <p>
      The Empty Fruit were purplish, and at the same time luminous. Their
      pleasant fragrances wafted far and wide, covering the lands in a wondrous
      scent for dozens of miles. Anyone who smelled it would become intoxicated.
      Their hearts would jump with a sudden zest and vibrancy, and they&#8217;d
      be a lot livelier.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;It looks like the Empty Fruit is going to become ripe any second
      now.&#8221; Han Sen&#8217;s heart was stricken with excitement.
    </p>

    <p>
      The situation was better than he feared it might be. He was worried that
      the Devil-Blood King might only make a move and release himself once the
      fruit had ripened.
    </p>

    <p>
      Now, he had already conquered the top, and was guarded by a slew of super
      creatures that followed his commands. That was what Han Sen wanted, for it
      benefitted him the most.
    </p>

    <p>
      Seeing the Empty Fruit not yet ripe, Han Sen did not rush. Patiently, he
      watched the fight unfold.
    </p>

    <p>
      There were nine super creatures running up the slopes now, with the Empty
      Fruit as their target. Han Sen had seen many of them before.
    </p>

    <p>
      The black-flame phoenix and green kirin were there. The black-tiger,
      armored phantom, black skeleton, and big white goose were also there. The
      other three approached together, and he had not seen them before. From
      what he could see, though, they looked frightening.
    </p>

    <p>
      Aside from the black phoenix and the green kirin, both of whom attacked
      the lime-green elephant, the others fought with the rest one-on-one. As
      the battle raged, none triumphed over each other, however. Overall, they
      seemed to be locked in a stalemate.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen did not know where the Devil-Blood King had earned his eight super
      creatures, but they were all incredibly powerful, and they did not look
      likely to lose.
    </p>

    <p>
      Although the armored phantom, black skeleton, black-flamed phoenix, and
      green kirin were strong enough to restrict their opponents, it was too
      difficult for them to ascend and reach the peak. They most certainly
      wouldn&#8217;t be getting it done in any short amount of time.
    </p>

    <p>
      The four Empty Fruit were close to maturing now, as well. It looked as if
      the attacking super creatures were not going to reach their destination in
      time.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen continued to hide on the nearby mountainside, and then he summoned
      Moment Queen. Quietly, he asked her, &#8220;Moment, how long left until it
      matures?&#8221;
    </p>

    <p>
      Moment Queen looked at the Empty Fruit and frowned. She said, &#8220;There
      seems to be a problem with the Empty Fruit.&#8221;
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen looked puzzled. When he observed the fruit, he didn&#8217;t notice
      anything out of place. So, he asked, &#8220;What problem?&#8221;
    </p>

    <p>
      Moment Queen took a second to contemplate her response, and then said,
      &#8220;I have seen the Empty Fruit before, and I know that there should be
      only one. Although that was over a hundred years ago, in no way should
      there be an additional three. It would take another thousand years for
      something like that to occur, so I am unable to understand why it has an
      extra three all of a sudden.&#8221;
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Are you saying three of those Empty Fruits are fake?&#8221; Han Sen
      looked surprised by this sudden revelation.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;I don&#8217;t know, but they do seem real enough,&#8221; Moment
      Queen answered, after spending a long time gazing at the fruit.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Hehe.&#8221; Han Sen was going to ask something else, but all of a
      sudden, he heard that strange laugh again. It unnerved him, and he looked
      around to find where it was coming from. Again, there was no one there;
      all he could see were the creatures fighting on the mountainside.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Strange. What is this peculiar phenomenon?&#8221; Han Sen was
      rather spooked. He was aware now that someone had to be following him, yet
      he couldn&#8217;t discover who it was.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;No, that&#8217;s not right,&#8221; Moment Queen said with a frown.
      Her eyes were locked upon the Empty Fruit with visible confusion.
    </p>

    <p>&#8220;What&#8217;s not right?&#8221; Han Sen asked.</p>

    <p>
      &#8220;It&#8217;s not just the number that is incorrect; the fruit itself
      is not right, either,&#8221; Moment Queen said.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Why? What&#8217;s not right with it?&#8221; Han Sen did not hurry
      Moment Queen for an answer. He just looked at her, as an uneasy feeling
      came over him.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Although I have never seen a mature Empty Fruit, and these do seem
      as if they&#8217;re about to mature very soon, there is something
      different about them,&#8221; Moment Queen said, as she pointed towards the
      vine.
    </p>

    <p>
      Just as Moment Queen was about to elucidate the reason why, the four
      fruits suddenly began to shine. The pleasant smell became a fog, like the
      holy fruit when it first matured.
