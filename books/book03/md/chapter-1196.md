As the march of time went on, so did Han Sen’s ravenous barrage of attacks.

His opponent was like a tumbler doll, refusing to fall over no matter how hard or how quickly Han Sen struck. Even while channeling all his powers of prediction, he simply couldn’t find a way to knock him down. Han Sen was actually shocked by what was going on.

Yuan Zhufeng was just as shocked. They had been going at it like this for one hour, and Han Sen had yet to make a single misstep or produce a move that featured a flaw.

Yuan Zhufeng was reducing his own abilities to match with his opponent, but he was starting to worry.

Yuan Zhufeng was strong, but he was a human, after all. Even he could make a mistake after such a long, intense session that required absolute focus.

And while he had been waiting for his opponent to make a mistake, he was starting to have the sneaking suspicion that this was what his opponent was waiting for, as well. They were both in on the game, waiting to see who would be the first to slip-up.

Yuan Zhufeng no longer treated Han Sen like a junior. He fought as seriously as he could and took him as a real challenger. Yuan Zhufeng was having to use every ounce of his power to stay strong, and he’d have to continue to do so if he wanted to emerge victorious.

Fang Mingquan was in awe. It was only supposed to be a casual, social match; he never expected to watch a balls-to-the-wall, high octane match such as this, given the circumstances.

Amidst the dizzying array of skills consistently being cast, Fang Mingquan was only able to recognize around one in ten. And before he could finish blinking to acknowledge a skill, another flurry of attacks and defensive skills had been flung.

Fang Mingquan knew his knowledge was lacking as he watched this battle between two hardcore elites. He was glad he had been recording the match, though. Once it was over, he’d be looking forward to a steady and studious rewatch.

Although he couldn’t fight very well himself, it was always an admirable trait of Fang Mingquan that his passion for combat never waned. It enthralled him, despite his lack of participation.

The fight was frightening to watch, and it kept its spectators on the edge of their seats. It was one that required a constant, pinpoint-precise usage of stamina and endurance to maintain a status quo that could collapse at any minuscule miscalculation. Any who were to watch it would know that, and it imbued the atmosphere with a feeling of dread and unease.

One attack, followed by one defense; whoever made a mistake first would be the loser.

After three hours, there was still no change. But Yuan Zhufeng’s gentle perspiration had turned to him full-on sweating bullets. This fight was no longer taxing on the body, it was exhausting to the mind.

His opponent continued to show no sign of human emotion, and it continued its assault with the cold lethality of a machine built to destroy. Yuan Zhufeng was starting to fear he’d be unable to keep up, and that he’d make a mistake any second now.

“Who is this man? Who can have such a vast amount of power and stamina?!” Yuan Zhufeng thought to himself.

He was well-acquainted with many of the elites that populated the Alliance, but his opponent was not someone he recognized. Wrack his mind as he might, he just couldn’t think of anyone who fit the bill.

But he didn’t think he was just some nobody, either. Anyone who possessed that much power must have some manner of renown.

Fang Mingquan had been there, staring intently for the past three hours. He was as captivated as ever. Still, he was starting to feel exhausted, moreso than the fighters that were actually engaged in the battle. And just as Fang Mingquan thought this fight would go on for another eternity and a day, an explosion sounded.

Yuan Zhufeng used his arms to block the incoming fist, but when the dust settled, he had lost.

“Impossible. He blocked the punch, but… he lost?” Fang Mingquan’s face had twisted into an expression of utter disbelief.

Seeing Yuan Zhufeng’s virtual body outside the battleground, Fang Mingquan had to immediately ask, “Old Yuan, did you encounter a glitch?”

Old Yuan gave a wry smile and answered, “I lost. He is not only strong of body; grand power resides in every aspect of that person.”

“He’s powerful overall?” Fang Mingquan wasn’t entirely sure what he was being told.

Old Yuan did not elaborate any further, though. Instead, he sent an invitation to his opponent, to request a meet.

“Who was your opponent? Do you know? Was he a demigod?” Fang Mingquan believed his opponent had to be someone of a comparable level.

Old Yuan smiled and admitted, “I don’t know who he is, but believe me when I tell you that he is just a surpasser.”

“A surpasser?!” Fang Mingquan was shocked, and he partially believed his ears had been fibbing. It was more than a surprise to hear a surpasser had beaten Old Yuan, even if he had weakened himself to compete.

Fang Mingquan wished to say something more, but all of a sudden, the opponent arrived to greet them.

“You are so strong. My name is Yuan Zhufeng; can we be friends so that we may compete again sometime?” Yuan Zhufeng gave a gentle, heartfelt smile.

Han Sen was surprised. He knew who Yuan Zhufeng was, but he never expected that was the person he had spent the past three hours fighting against.

“I appreciate your compliments.” Han Sen then showed him his ID and name, then added him as a friend. Han Sen respected his elders a great deal, particularly those that had done great services for humanity in their time.

Han Sen was not opposed to telling people he had healed, either.

“You are Han Sen?!” Fang Mingquan unwittingly blasted, while Yuan Zhufeng beside him was still deep in thought.

It was shocking to see him there fighting like that, as many demigods had believed his condition to be beyond repair. Although they had never met before, Yuan Zhufeng knew exactly who he was.

“You are healed?” Yuan Zhufeng asked, with visible surprise.

“Almost.” Han Sen smiled. He wished to say more, but all of a sudden, he disconnected from Skynet and disappeared.

“WARNING! WARNING! UNIVERSE IS UNDER ATTACK! ALL PASSENGERS OF UNIVERSE, PLEASE PROCEED TO THE EVACUATION TERMINAL!”

The hologram disconnected and then all doors opened. From beyond, the blaring sounds of a siren raised everyone to their feet and incited panic.

Boom!

The ship called Universe was shaken, causing everything to be cast around in disarray. It was as if something had rammed the ship.

Boom! Boom! Boom!

It kept going, as if a cannon was repeatedly firing at the ship.
