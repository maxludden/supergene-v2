<h2>Tianxia System</h2>
<h3>Chapter 2445</h3>

<p>“Mister Quin, why are we not going to the White River System? We
seem to be headed for Tianxia System instead.” An Extreme King
knight looked Bao Quin with confusion.</p>
<p>“The White River System is currently in turmoil. Interstellar
pirates are everywhere there. It might seem easy for Han Sen to
slip through the chaos, but it is a very populated place. Han Sen
has a bold personality, so it most likely compelled him to go to
the Tianxia System,” Bao Quin deduced tonelessly.</p>
<p>“But he is just a King. Tianxia System isn’t a feasible route
for someone of his level,” the knight said after a moment of
thought.</p>
<p>“Before he was exposed, no one would have believed he had the
gall to disguise himself as a prince of the Extreme King,” Bao Quin
responded, his eyes hard.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>“Slow down!” Bao’er was pushing the white whale through the
clouds at an insane speed. Although their transport could move very
quickly, it was supposed to be a whale, not a fighter jet. Ning Yue
was lying on the floor, clutching a chair while bawling her eyes
out. Her face was covered in tears and snot.</p>
<p>Han Sen peered out at the endless clouds, and he couldn’t help
but frown.</p>
<p>Although he already knew that the Tianxia System was dangerous,
seeing the system with his own eyes had still taken him aback.</p>
<p>Tianxia System’s clouds extended in all directions like an
ocean, making it hard for Han Sen to keep his sense of direction.
The endless clouds were colorful, as if the white whale was
surrounded by countless fluffy rainbows. The clouds were opaque
enough that it was difficult to see beyond the closest layer.</p>
<p>Now, Han Sen and his companions were traveling through blue
clouds. They were endless, and they were scarier than the depths of
the sea. In between the moving clouds, Han Sen could occasionally
see cloud beasts dancing.</p>
<p>Those crane-like cloud beasts were in flocks of several
thousand. They flew together like a cloud of their own, all moving
quickly in tandem.</p>
<p>Inside the blue clouds, they would sometimes see the flash of
magnetic storms. Typically, tools and gadgets were rendered useless
by such storms. But fortunately, the big white whale of the
crystallizers wasn’t affected by powerful magnetic interference.
The turbulence of the storm’s had no effect on the white whale,
which was why Han Sen wasn’t afraid to go through the Tianxia
System.</p>
<p>The white whale was like a deified creature, but it had no
lifeforce. Because of that, it didn’t send out a lifeforce for
others to sniff out. Ordinary xenogeneics wouldn’t attack it, and
Han Sen had indeed seen many xenogeneics along the way. But most of
them completely ignored the white whale. Some of the meaner ones
tried to attack the white whale, but they couldn’t really damage
the hull of the ship.</p>
<p>Aside from the cloud beasts, they rarely saw other elites in the
system. Even those of the higher races rarely came to hunt here. It
was way too dangerous, and it was almost never worth the risk.</p>
<p>Pang!</p>
<p>As the white whale blazed along, an explosion sounded off to the
side. The clouds rumbled and rolled, sort of like a tsunami. It
felt as if some terrifying creatures were in the middle of a war
somewhere in the fog.</p>
<p>Han Sen told Bao’er to go past whatever it was. After all, they
were running for their lives, not going on a safari. It was best
not to attract the attention of anything, and so they should focus
on getting through the fog as fast as possible.</p>
<p>But before Bao’er turned the white whale, a few people flew out
of the big clouds. Terror was written across their faces, and they
appeared to be running for their lives.</p>
<p>Their worries meant nothing to Han Sen. He didn’t have time to
worry about people who were running for their lives. But when he
got close enough to see their faces, Han Sen jerked back in
surprise.</p>
<p>Amidst the shadows, there were two pretty women that looked like
twins. One was Gu Qingcheng, and the other was Elysian Moon.</p>
<p>Han Sen couldn’t just ignore them. He had Bao’er drive the white
whale over to Gu Qingcheng.</p>
<p>When the people saw the white whale heading toward them, they
turned in another direction, trying desperately to get away from
this new threat as well. But soon after, they saw the mouth of the
white whale open. Someone emerged through the gap.</p>
<p>“Qingcheng, why are you here?” Han Sen asked, looking at Gu
Qingcheng and Elysian Moon.</p>
<p>Gu Qingcheng saw Han Sen, and so she flew towards him with
Elysian Moon. When the others saw that Gu Qingcheng and Han Sen
seemed to know each other, they looked relieved. They flew over to
the white whale, as well.</p>
<p>“There are deified creatures ahead. We should leave this place,”
Gu Qingcheng said to Han Sen after flying over there.</p>
<p>“Follow me.” Han Sen led the way. He invited Gu Qingcheng and
Elysian Moon into the white whale. The other people followed Gu
Qingcheng, entering the white whale as well.</p>
<p>Seeing that Gu Qingcheng knew them, Han Sen made no effort to
stop their entry.</p>
<p>“This is a battleship? And it can sail through the Tianxia
System? This is so weird,” said a twenty-year-old man. He was one
of the Demon, and he had deep purple horns. He looked around the
big white whale with great curiosity.</p>
<p>Han Sen told Bao’er to drive the white whale away from the
deified creatures. Then he looked at the people who had followed Gu
Qingcheng aboard and asked, “Who are they?”</p>
<p>There were a dozen of them, and they were all from different
races. They were mostly Dukes and Kings. Gu Qingcheng pointed at
one of the young Feather men.</p>
<p>“He hired Elysian Moon and me to protect him inside Tianxia
System.”</p>
<p>Han Sen looked at the Feather man. The man seemed very young,
and his lifeforce wasn’t that strong. He was a Marquise or Duke, at
best.</p>
<p>“My name is Qing Yu. Thank you for saving me. What is your
name?” the Feather man asked politely.</p>
<p>“Han Sen.” Han Sen had no plans of hiding his identity.</p>
<p>“You are the student of the newly deified Knife Queen? I have
heard your name before,” Fang Qing Yu said, glancing curiously over
Han Sen.</p>
<p>Surprisingly, Fang Qing Yu wasn’t like the other Feathers. All
of the rest of the Feathers hated Han Sen.</p>
<p>When Han Sen saw that they had no reaction to his name, he
figured that they hadn’t heard that he was wanted by the Extreme
King.</p>
<p>It made sense. Equipment didn’t work inside the Tianxia System,
so contacting the outside world would have been impossible. They
didn’t know what had happened out there.</p>
<p>Han Sen looked outside and noticed there were no more crazy
clouds. They must be far away from the deified xenogeneic now.</p>
<p>“This place should be safe. You can leave,” Han Sen said,
turning to Fang Qing Yu.</p>
<p>Fang Qing Yu quietly responded, “Brother Han, I would like you
to take me all the way through the Tianxia System. What would
require in trade for such a request?”</p>
<p>“Sorry, I’m not here to play games, and I’m not interested in a
business deal. Please get off my ship,” Han Sen said firmly.</p>
<p>He was on the lam. He wasn’t interested in spending any more
time with these people. He had only saved them because Gu Qingcheng
was there.</p>
<p>“Brother Han, please consider it. Tell me how much you want, and
I will gladly play you,” Fang Qing Yu said.</p>
<p>“Sorry, I am a little busy. I cannot take you guys,” Han Sen
said.</p>
<p>“Listen, buddy! You’re going to end up embarrassing yourself.”
One of the Destroyed stepped forward from behind Fang Qing Yu. He
glared at Han Sen as he spoke.</p>
<p>Other Dukes and Kings slowly surrounded them, too.</p>
