<p>In Narrow Moon’s Full Moon meeting room.</p>
<p>Six Kings had shown up for this meeting. Yisha, Moon Wheel King,
Night River King, Flower King, Black Moon King, and Shadow
King.</p>
<p>“Knife, do you really believe what he tells you? Despite being
only a Baron, he has managed to achieve a mind such as that with
Unlimited Sutra? Seriously? Not even Barons who go on to become
deified elites are that strong,” Night River King said.</p>
<p>Black Moon King coughed and said, “Night River, let’s not impose
limits that might not exist. This universe is so grand in its
reaches that there could be anything out there. Han Sen really is
talented. Just because you are unable to achieve such feats of
might, don’t presume others cannot either.”</p>
<p>“Black Moon, don’t talk such nonsense. Look at this universe!
Are there any Barons with that level of capability?” Night River
frowned.</p>
<p>“If everyone was able to do it, why else would we single out the
exemplary and call them geniuses?” Black Moon King asked
slowly.</p>
<p>Night River King started to respond, but Moon Wheel King cut him
off. Moon Wheel King looked at Flower King and Shadow King, and
said, “What do you two think?”</p>
<p>Flower King groaned and said, “Han Sen’s power seems unlikely,
but we can’t claim that there’s a problem without knowing what it
is. That hardly seems fair.”</p>
<p>Moon Wheel King nodded. He looked at Shadow King, and Shadow
King said, “I would rather put an end to this before it gets out of
hand.”</p>
<p>Yes!” Night River King said immediately. “Han Sen’s history is
far too strange, and he cannot be kept.”</p>
<p>Moon Wheel King looked at Black Moon King, and Black Moon King
said, “Killing a genius like that makes no sense. It will just
scare off the other races, and no other race will want to
co-operate with us.”</p>
<p>“Knife, you understand where we’re coming from, yes? He is your
student, so it is best that you decide what to do.” Moon Wheel King
looked at Yisha.</p>
<p>Yisha said calmly, “I gave him a chance. If he passes the test,
I can prove that he is fine. If he cannot pass the test, I will
sever ties with him and search for any threat he might pose. If I
find something, I will get rid of him.”</p>
<p>“What is the test? If he really is a spy from some other race,
he will have come prepared. He will pass the test.” Night River
King looked displeased.</p>
<p>“Oh? You think a Baron spy will be able to create a Teeth Knife
knifemind in three months?” Yisha’s face was expressionless.</p>
<p>Hearing Yisha say this, the other Kings stared at her with wide
eyes.</p>
<p>“Generate a Teeth Knife knifemind in three months? Really?” Moon
Wheel King asked, stumbling slightly over the question.</p>
<p>“What is the problem?” Yisha responded.</p>
<p>“I have no problem with that. If he can accomplish that in three
months, then I will believe he is a real genius,” Night River King
slowly said, as he sat down.</p>
<p>It sounded like complete lunacy. It was silly, to think of
generating a Teeth Knife knifemind in three months. Across the
history of the Rebate, no one had managed anything like that.</p>
<p>Night River King did not believe Han Sen could do it, as Teeth
Knife was exclusive to the Rebate. Even among the Rebate, it was
rare. The only person who had mastered the skill was Yisha, and you
couldn’t cheat your way to learn it.</p>
<p>The Kings were mollified. If Han Sen could generate a Teeth
Knife knifemind in three months, then practicing Touching Flower
Finger with such proficiency would make a lot more sense.</p>
<p>“If we can confirm Han Sen is legit, and he really is a true
genius, should we give him a bit of a reputation? His identity
should allow him to become a member of Moon Garden. He did make us
proud in this event, after all. If we still don’t let him in, the
outsiders in Narrow Moon will become suspicious of us,” Black Moon
King said.</p>
<p>“If he can generate a Teeth Knife knifemind in three months, I
would be willing to make him a teacher in the Moon Garden,” Night
River King said grimly.</p>
<p>Black Moon King smiled at Night River King, then turned his gaze
across the table.</p>
<p>“Moon Wheel King, what do you think?”</p>
<p>“If he is legit, and he really is that talented, he should
definitely be a member of Moon Garden,” Moon Wheel King said.</p>
<p>“If everyone has no problem with this, then we shall all
reconvene in three months.” Yisha stood up and left the Full Moon
meeting room.</p>
<p>Lu Xiaomei was walking down the street. The dark circles under
her eyes were heavy, and she kept rubbing her head. Ever since Han
Bao’er had entered her school, she had begun to feel like she was
drowning.</p>
<p>She was a kindergarten teacher. Before Bao’er, she had dealt
with kids crying, not wanting to go to school, and things like
that. But now, going to work was like walking into hell itself. If
her job hadn’t paid well, she would have quit a long time ago to
escape having to deal with the monster that resided there.</p>
<p>“I can’t do it anymore. I am going to die! Today is supposed to
be a holiday, and so I should treat myself with a day at the spa.
And buy myself a nice gift! Ever since that little witch arrived, I
look ten years older.” Lu Xiaomei walked into a high-class female
club. She swiped her card as she walked through the door. “I really
do need to treat myself better. I can just eat nutrient fluids for
the month to make up for what I spend today.”</p>
<p>After she entered the place, the attendants served her with
passion. She felt as if she had ascended in society, taking the
place of royalty.</p>
<p>“This is my life. Finally, I don’t have to worry about that
monster.” Lu Xiaomei wrapped a bathrobe around herself and lay down
to wait for her masseuse.</p>
<p>“Miss Lu,” a voice sounded in her ear. It made her muscles
freeze. She jumped up and frantically looked around. She didn’t see
anyone there, so she felt relieved. She lay back down on the bed
and said to herself, “I am starting to hallucinate. Clearly, I am
far too stressed out. Maybe I’ll go shopping today, too. That
should help.”</p>
<p>After lying back down, Lu Xiaomei turned over, and there was a
pretty little girl next to her, smiling.</p>
<p>“Miss Lu, what stores are you going to?”</p>
<p>You… you… why are you here!” Lu Xiaomei looked like she had just
seen a ghost. She jumped up and pointed at the girl. “I own this
club. Did you not know that?” Bao’er shook her head.</p>
<p>Lu Xiaomei’s eyes opened wide. “You own this place?”</p>
<p>“Yes. I have thirty-one branches of this establishment, all
across the city.” Bao’er spoke with innocence.</p>
<p>“This b*tch is showing off again…” Lu Xiaomei felt both jealous
and depressed. She was really hoping Bao’er would disappear right
now.</p>
<p>But an evil expression crossed Bao’er’s face, and she said, “By
the way, I am going to the VIP area for a session. Would you like
to come?”</p>
<p>“Can I?” Lu Xiaomei was quite shocked. It was a very expensive
place, and she could only come here once a month. For half a month,
she would have to eat nutrient fluid just to compensate for how
much that place cost. The VIP area was a place you couldn’t easily
go to—even if you had a lot of money. She wanted to go, but
non-VIPs weren’t allowed.</p>
<p>“Of course, if you want. I can ask the manager to provide you
with a VIP card.” Bao’er smiled.</p>
