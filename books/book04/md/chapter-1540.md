  Han Sen was approaching Little Lion King, prompting Yu Miao and Goddess to look at him. They were unsure of what he wanted.

Although Little Jade Lion was still young, Goddess and Yu Miao did not dare harm him. Goddess had taken his Lionheart Stamp, yes, but she made sure to give it back to him. They were all scared of incurring the wrath of White Lion King.

When Little Jade Lion’s company saw Han Sen draw near, they looked to be quite alert. They all stared down at Han Sen angrily, as if they were ready to rip him to shreds.

“What are you doing?” Little Jade Lion wasn’t in a good mood. He asked Han Sen the question coldly, and if the answer displeased him, he was ready to lunge at the human and rip him apart. It’d at least be an outlet for the anger he felt, after having lost the battle he just had.

“Don’t you remember our deal?” Han Sen said.

He wanted to see if the Little Lion King would keep the promise he had made. If he did, he’d help the Little Lion King retake the Godlight Tunnel. If he did that, at least the creature would benefit in some way.

Han Sen did not have many people working for him, and if he took the Godlight Tunnel, he wouldn’t have the numbers to safeguard it. If Han Sen could get Lion King’s party on his side, it would be ideal.

If Little Lion did not keep the promise, though, it wasn’t as if Han Sen would lose much. He saw the fight against Goddess, and if he had to fight the lion, he wasn’t afraid of the prospect.

“It’s you.” Upon hearing Han Sen say this, Little Jade Lion King’s face became distorted by shock.

He hadn’t expected Crystal Core’s master to be human, and he hadn’t expected to see him there. He had no clue how to respond.

Yu Miao and Goddess saw Little Lion King’s expression, and it made them frown. They didn’t know anything about the deal between Han Sen and the Little Lion, or why it was important enough to make him react the way he was.

Han Sen stepped closer to Little Lion King, and the creatures behind began roaring at him. They were ready to rip him limb from limb.

“Stop.” Little Jade Lion King’s face looked weird, but he still brought his creatures to heel.

Han Sen walked in front of Little Jade Lion King and leaned near his ear to whisper, “You help me out in God’s Ruin, and after that, you’re off the hook. I won’t own you.”

Little Jade Lion King’s mood was renewed with happiness. Just moments before, his heart had been knotted with contradictions. He didn’t want to betray his dignity and obey a human as his master, but a deal was a deal. It wasn’t as if he could have said no.

Now Han Sen had just told him he’d only want help in God’s Ruin, Little Jade Lion was beaming with happiness. He said out loud, “No problem! If there’s anything you need, just tell me. With me here, I’ll give you my aid for everything.”

Yu Miao and Goddess frowned, not having the faintest idea what Han Sen had said to the lion to make him behave in such a way.

Han Sen smiled. “I won’t need much, but I will be taking Godlight Tunnel. And when it’s taken, you and your people can protect it. From there, any findings we make can be shared half-and-half, as well.”

“Okay,” Little Lion King agreed. Although he felt that he wouldn’t be of much help in claiming the tunnel, he’d still prefer this to being enslaved. So, he wasn’t going to hesitate in his contribution.

“Little Lion King, are you going to go back on your word and disobey a promise?” Black Back Dog addressed Little Lion King with fury.

Little Lion King looked shocked, and he said, “I didn’t break a promise. It won’t be me fighting you. It’s this guy that’ll be doing that. It’s his idea, and there’s nothing I can do about that.”

Yu Miao and Goddess heard what Little Lion King had to say, and they immediately looked confused. He used to do things as he pleased, but now Little Lion King seemed afraid of a human. They weren’t quite sure what was happening.

Han Sen ignored the others and walked towards the entrance. Without delay, he was going to take the entry point of Godlight Tunnel.

This movement shocked even Little Lion King. Although he was cocky, he wouldn’t ignore Goddess, surely. Clenching his jaw, he brought his troops forward to follow Han Sen.

Little Lion King hadn’t expected Han Sen to want to start a fight, but Han Sen really wanted to kill Goddess and her dog. This would be the perfect opportunity for that.

When they stole the Starsea Orb, Han Sen was in his super king spirit mode. They didn’t know it was Han Sen they had almost killed, but Han Sen remembered their cruelty without forgetting a single detail.

“Fuck! You’re just a human, and yet you’re being so arrogant! Do you really want to die?” Black Back Dog shouted angrily. The creatures of Sacred then ran forward to block the advance of Han Sen, Little Jade Lion King, and his entourage.

“Whoever gets in my way will die.” Han Sen had a thirst for blood, so he didn’t talk or negotiate any more than that. He shone with a red light, and then, the ruby wings spawned behind him.

The red light was like blood, and when Han Sen pulled out his Taia sword, he swung with wretched strength right across Black Back Dog with a flap of his wings.

Black Back Dog only had a gemstone geno core, and he hadn’t expected a human would lash out at him so boldly. He hadn’t prepared himself, so it was too late for him to dodge. He spat out some black light and tried to block Han Sen.

But the red light cut through the black light in his mouth, and the moment Han Sen flashed past the Black Back Dog, he whispered into his ears, “Remember the Starsea Orb?”

Black Back Dog’s pupils went small. He looked at Han Sen, trying to figure out what he might have wanted, but Taia had already lopped his head clean off. The dog’s head, with an expression of fear and confusion, rolled through the air. Everyone was frozen. It had happened too quickly for anyone to react.

No one had expected a human to kill a creature from Sacred like that. Goddess’ eyes opened wide, and she too was frozen still. She couldn’t believe Han Sen had killed her dear Black Back Dog.

Little Jade Lion King was frozen, too. He had not expected Han Sen to immediately start killing, and start with Black Back Dog, no less.

Black Back Dog’s history was something special. It was a super creature’s heir that had grown up by Goddess’ side. It was a famous and renowned character of Sacred Shelter.

The scary thing was, it had been one-hit killed in a grisly fashion. It hadn’t even been given the opportunity to fight back. The dog might have been reckless, but the human that killed him obviously had to be someone special, too.

Han Sen was in the air, still glowing red with his wings flapping. Everyone looked at him with complicated expressions.

“You are dead!” Goddess’ eyes were filled with a murderous rage. Black Back Dog might have been a subordinate of hers, but he had become more than that over the years. They had grown up together.

Black Back Dog getting killed made her very angry. She couldn’t hide the fact that she wanted to kill Han Sen now.
