  Han Sen was never too interested in things that were not pretty, but he would never have guessed the purple copper sword was actually Asura, the alpha of the Demon race.

He carried the little girl through the Soldier Weapon Sky while in flight. He hoped to find a trace or two of Bao’er. Now, Soldier Weapon Sky was bigger than ever. Han Sen flew through the air for half a day, and he had yet to find a single sign of Bao’er’s body. It made him feel really bad.

“If Bao’er became a weapon, I do not think I will be able to find her,” Han Sen thought.

While he was thinking, he suddenly heard the weapon forest emanate with the sound of a moaning weapon. He used the Dongxuan Aura to cover that place. It was a great ax that was moaning.

Han Sen carried the little girl with him as he descended to the big ax. The big ax was 90-feet tall. Even the blade itself was two stories tall. It was unknown what sort of being might have been able to wield a weapon as large as that.

Judging from the moaning of the big ax, it was rather similar to Han Sen. It used to be a creature once upon a time.

Han Sen stopped. The little girl’s hands were still holding onto the metal jian Han Sen. She looked like a little witch that was riding a broomstick. She was not willing to let go.

Han Sen felt a headache come on. He was not a heartless man. He did not want to bring harm to the little girl, but the little girl kept following him. That was not good for him.

A voice sounded from not too far away. “Hm, we found another member of the soldiers, but it looks like you picked a useless weapon.”

A young man had arrived. He was clad in armor and holding a knife. His presence was very strange, but he was quite similar to the little girl. Like the woman who took the purple copper sword, he was likely a member of the soldiers too.

In the next second, the young man slashed the little girl. The little girl leaped down from the metal jian. She held the metal jian and fought the young man’s knife.

Han Sen used Jadeskin to turn the jian into one with an ice jade body. He struck the incoming knife.

After the hit, the young man’s knife was snapped in half. The ice-jade jian’s overbearing aura did not reduce either. It moved forward to sever the young man’s head.

There was a “pang” as the young man’s head was squashed by the ice-jade jian.

Suddenly, something unbelievable happened. The body of the young man whose head had been broken turned into a spirit light. It went into the little girl. The little girl looked as if she had just been given a shot of adrenaline. She grew up very quickly. She now looked to be around 10 years old.

When the little girl grew up, a strange power came from her. It went into Han Sen’s jian, forcing it to exhibit some changes.

Han Sen was shocked. He discovered the strength of his body had just increased. Even if his Break World rate had not been altered, the increase in his body’s strength was still a great boon for him.

“Can something that good really happen? Compared to strengthening your body, I would prefer actually having a body.” Han Sen felt a bit depressed.

While was thinking, a scary sword light arose. The sword light was rather like a storm that destroyed the weapon forest.

Han Sen’s Dongxuan Aura covered the place. It enabled him to see a man and a woman, two holy soldiers, engaged in battle. The weapon the woman was holding was a strange sort of sword.

The other soldier member, who was wielding a spear, had his weapon broken by the woman’s sword. The man became a spirit light that entered the woman’s body. It made her sword stronger as well. The sword glowed even more.

After seeing the sword, Han Sen felt his heart jump. The sword presence was something he was familiar with, but he could not be entirely certain.

“Did Qin Xiu become a weapon too?” Han Sen observed the sword.

The sword was straight, but both sides of the blade were serrated. It looked like a really scary weapon. It felt like even if one was just to inch closer to it, one would be hurt.

The presence of that sword was not unlike Qin Xiu.

“Qin Xiu and the people of the God Chaos Party were always in the 33 skies, but they should not be down here in Soldier Weapon Sky. How did Qin Xiu end up like a sword over here?” As Han Sen wondered about this, the woman holding the sword discovered the little girl. She looked cold as she waved her sword on her way to slash her.

The woman swung her sword so quickly that the little girl could not react in time. So, Han Sen jumped before her and went to clash with the enemy sword.

Dong!

The sword and jian collided against each other. The sword was like a saw going to the jian. It left a mark on the ice-jade jian whereas the opposing sword was fine.

“Is that really Qin Xiu?” Han Sen’s heart jumped. He saw the woman wave her sword. This time, Han Sen used the power of Super Spank to strike the enemy blade.

Then, there was another gold-jade moaning sound. The ice-jade jian was delivered a deep gash. Han Sen saw that the sword was not damaged.

The woman holding the sword did not attack. She looked at Han Sen strangely and said, “You have managed to block two of my sword strikes, yet you are not dead. You have improved quite a bit.”

“Qin Xiu.” Han Sen was shocked. The woman’s voice sounded like a woman, but its tone and the mannerisms used were like those of a man.

Clearly, that soldier member was controlled by Qin Xiu. She was not the one controlling the saw sword.

The woman said, “I did not expect to see you here, but this is a good thing. If I kill you here, Wan’er will stop thinking about you.” She picked up her sword and tried attacking Han Sen.

Han Sen started to fly. The jian perforated the little girl’s clothes to hook her body so she could go with him. He used Galaxy Teleportation.

When Han Sen finished using Galaxy Teleportation, the woman was in front of him with the saw sword slashing toward him.

“You can’t escape,” Qin Xiu coldly said.

“If I can’t run, then I will have to fight.” Han Sen put down the little girl and used all the power in his body to open four Break World-class geno arts. His jian glowed with a jade light. It was going to the saw sword Qin Xiu had become.

With the buffing power of those four geno arts, the jian’s body and opposing sword struck each other. The jian was delivered another mark. After a few more hits, more gashes sprinkled the composure of the jian.

“I do not know if this is going to work.” Han Sen tried to use his Jadeskin power to create a hollow structure so he could make the jian stronger.

The results were not so great. The jian received more wounds.
