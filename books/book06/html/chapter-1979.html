<p>“Brother Han, are you really confident in this?” Yu Jing asked,
staring at Han Sen.</p>
<p>“Yes,” Han Sen answered with certainty.</p>
<p>Yu Jing hesitated. He gritted his teeth, grabbed Han Sen’s
hands, and said, “Brother Han, I place my life in these hands of
yours. You have to be careful and see my safety is secured.”</p>
<p>“Go. I will have Spell fire when the time is right.” Han Sen
patted Yu Jing on the shoulder and smiled.</p>
<p>Yu Jing ran towards the jade fruit tree. Before he could get
close, ants began to pour out from under the rock. It was like a
black river headed for him.</p>
<p>Yu Jing quickly came running back as Han Sen commanded Spell to
ready a rocket. Then, she fired behind the man. Boom!</p>
<p>The white light exploded behind Yu Jing. It killed a lot of Jade
Ants. Announcements kept running in Han Sen’s head, declaring he
had killed a Viscount Jade Ant. He also heard himself receive a
bunch of beast souls.</p>
<p>Han Sen had battled ants before, and he had always received
armor beast souls. But these Jade Ants only gave him pet- type
beast souls. That disappointed him quite a bit.</p>
<p>That was because pet-type beast souls were annoying. If you
wanted to use them effectively, you’d have to get them to combat
mode. He had found himself in possession of many low-tier pets in
the past.</p>
<p>Jade Ants could spit corrosive gas, but the range was short and
the gas was slow. Before the ants could get to Han Sen, Spell had
fired two rockets and laid waste to them.</p>
<p>Suddenly, a few gold shadows emerged from the stone nest. These
ants were twice as big as the ordinary ones. They had wings, and
they glimmered with a golden light.</p>
<p>They flew straight at Yu Jing like shadows.</p>
<p>“Brother Han, help me!” Yu Jing shouted at Han Sen as he
ran.</p>
<p>Seeing that seven or eight Earl class Jade Ants were about to
catch up with Yu Jing, Han Sen realized that Spell’s rockets were
going to be too slow. She had killed many Viscount ants, but more
and more of them were approaching.</p>
<p>“Spell!” Han Sen took control of her, ditching the rocket
launcher and pulling out the sniper rifle.</p>
<p>Spell lifted the sniper, aimed it above Yu Jing’s head, and
pulled the trigger. A bullet of light was fired, and it struck one
of the Earl ants.</p>
<p>That power tore through the ant’s wing and perforated its shell.
It fell from the air.</p>
<p>“Xenogeneic Earl hunted. Jade Ant: xenogeneic gene found.”</p>
<p>The announcement played in Han Sen’s head. Yu Jing was
approaching excitedly, saying, “Shit, Brother Han! Your geno
armament is strong. Hurry! Fire a few more shots and finish them
all off.”</p>
<p>One second later, Spell raised the rifle again and fired.
Unfortunately, she missed this time. She failed to hit the Earl
Jade Ant that was flying quickly towards her.</p>
<p>Yu Jing’s excited voice turned to one of crying. “Brother, can
you aim better?”</p>
<p>Seeing Yu Jing draw even closer, Spell swapped her sniper for a
pair of pistols. Then, she fired them into the sky.</p>
<p>A series of shots were heard. She missed a few times, but she
still managed to hit two Earl Jade Ants. The pistols were not as
powerful as the sniper, though, and the bullets only punched holes
in the shells of the creatures. They didn’t kill the ants.</p>
<p>“Spell!” Han Sen shouted. Spell ran towards Han Sen and turned
into a pair of pistols that flew into Han Sen’s own hands.</p>
<p>Han Sen’s left and right hands clutched the Spell pistols. He
fired them into the sky simultaneously. Each bullet came launching
out with a stunning muzzle flash.</p>
<p>And again, there was a pang pang noise. Han Sen fired seven
bullets, and all seven hit their desired target. Seven Earl ants
were hit.</p>
<p>Han Sen’s bullets were as strong as Spell’s. The only difference
was that Spell’s bullets were fueled by the raw power of The Story
of Genes, while Han Sen could create bullets from any geno art he
possessed.</p>
<p>After the seventh shot, the seven Earl Jade Ants each had a
bullet hole inside them. The wounds were not deadly, though, and
the ants could still fight.</p>
<p>But they spiraled like planes losing control. They crashed into
the ground and could not get airborne again. Small turtle symbols
were glazed across each of them.</p>
<p>Han Sen’s bullets were now powered by Turtle. It stopped the
ants from flying, and it reduced their speed.</p>
<p>Han Sen kept firing his guns at the Earl ants on the floor.
Their shells splintered and broke as their bodies oozed blood. Han
Sen killed one ant immediately.</p>
<p>“Xenogeneic Earl hunted. Jade Ant: xenogeneic gene found.”</p>
<p>“Shoot them! Shoot them!” Yu Jing shouted with excitement.</p>
<p>The Earl Jade Ants had been robbed of their ability to fly, and
they were slowed dramatically. They were no longer a threat to Yu
Jing.</p>
<p>Han Sen fell back, repeatedly squeezing the triggers. The joy of
firing a gun was incomparable to the wielding of a knife.</p>
<p>Han Sen killed another Earl Jade Ant, and then there was a
noise. A pure black ant flew out from under the stone, with a shell
that was wreathed in golden symbols.</p>
<p>This ant was smaller than the Earls, but its presence was far
scarier. It flapped its wings and flew towards Han Sen. Its claws
were like blades, and they came swinging towards him.</p>
<p>The gold light came past Han Sen like a knifelight.</p>
<p>Han Sen moved and evaded the gold lights. Han Sen then fired his
guns, but the Jade Ant Queen was too fast. It was able to dodge
every bullet.</p>
<p>The ant queen rose into the air, shrieking. The gold symbols on
the shell and wings glowed. Its speed and power were increasing,
and it was going to attack Han Sen again.</p>
<p>“Run! This mutant ant queen is as strong as a Marquise. We
cannot fight it!” Before Yu Jing could finish his warning,</p>
<p>Han Sen had drawn another weapon and gone running towards the
ant queen.</p>
<p>The bullets could not catch up with the ant queen, but the
rabbit shoes could. Han Sen rushed by the gold lights and used the
Ghost Teeth Knife on the ant queen, breaking its shell and leaving
a big mark on it. Blood came out, as did a plume of purple
smoke.</p>
