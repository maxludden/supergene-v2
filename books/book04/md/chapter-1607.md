  The Yu family spirits were going to ask the approaching army what was going on. But before Han Sen was even close enough to open a dialogue, a punch was being thrown their way.

Seeing the demonic force approaching, the Yu family spirits became enraged. They commanded all their troops to attack the Fallen Slaughter Han Sen had become.

Outer Sky Shelter had existed in the Fourth God’s Sanctuary for a long time. The occupants there were not afraid of Fallen Slaughter or the creatures that hailed from Wind Song Desert.

Seeing the holy lights come shining forth from the spirits, Han Sen did not dare make contact with them. Outer Sky Shelter was home to many elites, and Han Sen had seen what had happened to Fallen Slaughter—he wasn’t going to allow himself to suffer the same fate.

Han Sen gathered his might and flew upwards. He dodged the attacks, letting the crystal shoe carry him into their shelter.

The eyes of the Wind Song Desert creature horde were blazing red. Without restraint, they all followed Han Sen inside. This also brought him some relief. He had been worried the creatures would turn tail and flee once he penetrated the shelter. If Han Sen had gone inside all alone, he would probably have been killed.

Fortunately, his worries did not manifest. When the creatures poured into the shelter, the Outer Sky elites were pushed back and forced to split their attention between fighting all the different creatures.

The earth trembled as that horrible fight began. Frightening powers coursed through every inch of the atmosphere, and the shelter became a chaotic mess.

After Han Sen ran into the shelter, he found a powerful spirit standing in front of him. It was from the Yu family. It was stronger than Yu Miao, indicating it was one of the shelter’s elites.

Han Sen threw a punch towards it, prompting the spirit to give him a disapproving look. It pulled out an item that looked like a shining ring, and the demonic force Han Sen unleashed was absorbed inside it.

After the ring absorbed that force, it continued flying towards Han Sen and arrived just in front of his face.

Han Sen’s arm then shone black, and he summoned his Overbearing Shield to deflect it.

When the halo came against the shield, a metallic sound rung out The shield displayed its signature overbearing, making the ring ricochet back at the initial caster.

The spirit was quickly given a shock. He used both of his hands to try and catch that halo, and when he did, he was sent flying backward. He crashed into a tower, causing pieces of it to collapse.

Two beasts and three spirits blocked Han Sen’s way next. They combined arms to go against him.

Han Sen could not change his direction, though. The only way he could go was forward. He put all his strength into his shield, making it increase in size. After it grew, he used it to block every incoming attack.

With Fallen Slaughter’s mighty body, Han Sen was able to hold the Overbearing Shield effectively, even while it was in its ultimate form. It wasn’t difficult at all anymore.

Boom!

Han Sen’s body was sent back dozens of meters. The spirits and creatures that hit the shield were all sent rocketing away, too, coughing up blood as they went.

Now Han Sen was really starting to feel the benefit of having such a strong body. With Fallen Slaughter’s powerful build, Han Sen could keep going as soon as his feet touched the ground again. There was no need to stop and recover.

And while the crystal shoe helped boost his movement, Han Sen knew he had taken quite the impact. It was strange how he only felt a modicum of pain in his chest. He wasn’t properly hurt. His body was strong.

Han Sen held the shield and his Split-Blade as he went now. He gathered up another demonic force, like an ancient demon. With it, he blasted away the creatures and spirits that tried to stand against him.

The weaker creatures and spirits were all killed. Han Sen was unstoppable right now.

Because of the constant stream of new creatures coming into the shelter, though, most of the elites were spread thin. Very few were able to go up against Han Sen at a time.

Fallen Slaughter was a top-tier creature. Even two-on-one did not put Han Sen at a disadvantage. That was doubly so, given Han Sen was able to wield the supreme Overbearing Shield.

It had been so long since Han Sen had a good fight like this. His weapon and shield did not slow down for a minute, as the constant onslaught of creatures and spirits came to do battle with him. Eventually, they were falling back, with Han Sen being the one on their heels.

As Han Sen was enjoying how things were going, the crystal shoe suddenly changed direction. It was making him go somewhere particular within Outer Sky Shelter.

Han Sen was shocked. He thought the crystal shoe was just taking him forward as it always had, and it had just happened to cross the shelter. This obviously wasn’t true, as they were now leading him through the shelter to someplace specific.

“What is the connection between the crystal shoe and Outer Sky Shelter? Why would it want to be here?” Han Sen pondered the mystery, but it was futile. He had no choice but to follow the shoe, anyway.

Yu Miao was surprised when she witnessed the fight. She also felt something was amiss. Recently, she had spent a lot of time focusing on Han Sen, and she was aware he was in possession of the Overbearing Shield and Split-Blade. She wondered why those two items would suddenly end up in Fallen Slaughter’s hands. She couldn’t figure out why, but she just knew there had to be something wrong.

After Han Sen committed to a bit more killing, a palace was soon standing before him. It looked weird.

The rest of Outer Sky Shelter was composed of stone, wood, and bronze. They were all quite old-fashioned looking. This palace in the shelter, however, did not match the rest. It looked out of place, as if someone had placed it there against its will.

The entire palace appeared to have been created out of glass. There was no similar architecture anywhere else in the shelter. It was like a giant glass sculpture.

With the crystal shoe still firmly on, Han Sen ended up walking directly in front of the glass palace. It looked as if the shoe was going to smash him right into the locked door.

Han Sen then saw the placard above the gate, which read: Eastern King Palace. This surprised Han Sen, because he knew who that was.

When Han Sen was on the top floor of Destiny’s Tower, he read the message left behind by that spirit. It read: Eastern King was here. That was how he knew Eastern King’s name.

Now that he saw Eastern King Palace, Han Sen was quite surprised. He thought to himself, “Is the crystal shoe somehow connected to Eastern King? Or is Eastern King a woman, and the owner of this shoe? Is that why the shoe is coming here? Is it trying to return to its master?”

As Han Sen pondered this, he was dragged directly in front of the gate. He saw someone outside the gate. The person looked very cold as he came toward Han Sen.

“My King!” shouted the spirits that had been chasing Han Sen.

Han Sen was shocked. This man was Outer Sky Shelter’s master and the elder of the Yu family. It was the emperor class spirit Outer Sky King.
