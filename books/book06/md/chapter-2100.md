Suddenly, Han Sen’s eyes brightened. It looked as if he knew what he wanted.

Sky Palace’s leader smiled at Han Sen. “Tell me. Whatever you need! I see your Master Yisha as a genuine student, and you are my student by extension. So, shirk any guilt and ask of me whatever you desire.”

“Leader, I will not ask for much. I recently learned Suppress Evil. The technique is quite amazing, and I would appreciate it if you would help me progress further with it. I would like to learn it faster.” Han Sen bowed.

Sky Palace leader stared at him in silence. He would never have guessed that Han Sen would request this. This could be either be very easy or very hard.

The Sky Palace leader had been asked to teach Suppress Evil to Han Sen, but how much would Han Sen be able to learn? There were eleven tiers to Suppress Evil, and many Sky Palace Kings had not learned them. The Sky Palace leader couldn’t even guess how long it might take to teach Han Sen this.

But he was the leader, and Han Sen had just asked to be taught a skill. It would be bad form if he was unable to teach one geno art to just one student.

Sky Palace leader went silent for a bit, and then said, “Suppress Evil is a secret skill belonging to Sky Palace. It is complicated. It is not something you can learn over the course of a couple days. That being said, there is a riskier method that would enable you to learn it far faster. Would you like to give it a try?”

Han Sen frowned. The Sky Palace leader had put the ball back in his court. The man said it was risky, but he did not mention how risky. If Han Sen didn’t agree to the offer, then the blame for not accepting the teaching would be at his feet.

Of course, if Han Sen agreed, he did not know the dangers he might be walking into. He didn’t know if he could handle the risks.

Han Sen went silent a little bit, and then he gritted his teeth. “I would like to give it a try.”

“Good. You are definitely Yisha’s student. I have faith in you. Go prepare and look for me on Hidden Path Island.” The Sky Palace leader then waved his hand to dismiss Han Sen.

Han Sen bowed and departed Sky Palace. On his way, he mulled over why the leader might be sending him to Hidden Path Island.

Han Sen knew Hidden Path Island was a restricted section of Sky Palace. Without the leader’s permission, no one could go there. As for what the place contained, he did not know. He’d have to find out the next day.

But Han Sen did not think the leader would put him through too much harm. At the most, he thought the leader might only make him endure a little bit of suffering. If accepting a little risk could truly allow him to skip through five or six tiers of Suppress Evil, it’d be well worth it.

That geno art was too complicated. If he learned it like normal, it’d take him a few years to master it.

Before going to Hidden Path Island, Han Sen invited Lone Bamboo, Thousand Feather Crane, and the Yun sisters for a meet up. He also tried to find out more about where he was going.

Yun Sushang, hearing the leader would take Han Sen there, was given a shock.

Yun Suyi immediately said, “Hidden Path Island is not a place ordinary people can go to. King class elites are only permitted there when they are on the cusp of leveling up. That place is extremely dangerous. Many Kings have failed to level up there and suffered grievous injuries in consequence. I can’t fathom why the leader might want to take you there.”

The few of them told Han Sen what they knew about Hidden Path Island. They did not know much, and more than anything, it sounded as if it was just a place for Kings to level up.

The Kings that entered would either come out half-deified or half-dead. It was very dangerous, and none had ever been known to go there without first being King class.

Thousand Feather Crane thought and said, “We don’t have to worry too much, though. Our leader won’t want to hurt Han Sen. He obviously has his reasons for bringing Han Sen to such a place.”

Han Sen thought this, too. If the Sky Palace leader wanted to bring him harm, he wouldn’t have to go to this much trouble.

The next morning, Han Sen took Bao’er with him to Hidden Path Island. Outside the island, he found the Sky Palace leader standing atop a mountain peak. He smiled and waved, as if he was some sort of angel.

“Greetings.” Han Sen set the legless crane down on the mountain. Then, he bowed to the leader.

The Sky Palace leader waved his hand. “These are the stairs that lead to Hidden Path Cave. Walk these stairs and see how much you can learn from them.”

Han Sen was shocked. He hesitated, blinking down at the stairs. “Leader, are you not going to teach me?”

“Suppress Evil is an unusual art. Even if you were to listen to me lecture you, you wouldn’t learn very much. This place is different, however, and you will understand that when you walk these stairs. If you are talented enough, you can level up Suppress Evil quickly. It won’t be too difficult to knock down a few tiers this way.” The Sky Palace leader smiled at Han Sen.

“I’ve heard that this is a place where Kings come to level up. I am merely an Earl, so I don’t think I have what it takes.” Han Sen didn’t really want to go into that cave.

“You can back out now, if you wish.” Sky Palace leader bared his teeth in a grin.

Han Sen clenched his jaw and started to descend the steps. The steps were circular, and when he looked down, he could not see the bottom. It was like a spiral that continued down forever into some abyss.

The endless spiral staircase was dizzying.

Han Sen looked back up and saw the Sky Palace leader smiling at the exit. Han Sen couldn’t go back now, though. He lowered his head and kept going. Bao’er sat on his shoulders, curiously looking around.

There was nothing except for stairs. Han Sen followed the steps that led down into a bottomless pit.

He did not know how many stairs he had descended when he came to a stone door. On its frame were a bunch of numbers.

“00001… What does that mean? Are there ten thousand doors up ahead? What might be beyond those doors?” Han Sen frowned.

As Han Sen wondered this to himself, the stone door opened by itself.

At the entrance of Hidden Path Cave, there was a woman wearing a black mask. She appeared next to the leader. The leader looked inside the cave and spoke to the black-masked woman. This is your territory. Watch him, and do not allow him to die.”

You brought him here. This is your responsibility. I do not care about what happens.” The black-masked woman said, then entered Hidden Path Cave.

The Sky Palace leader smiled when she turned. He stepped onto a cloud and left the island to return to the Sky Palace Garden.
