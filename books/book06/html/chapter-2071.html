<h2>Cocky Red Cloud</h2>
<h3>Chapter 2071</h3>

<p>Lone Bamboo chased the red cloud up into the air, slashing
faster and faster with his blade. But the red cloud was way too
quick, and it managed to avoid each and every one of Lone Bamboo’s
sword airs.</p>
<p>“I will help!” Han Sen drew his knife and swung it towards the
red cloud. He summoned the wings on his ears, and his speed
increased.</p>
<p>The red cloud sped up even faster and evaded Han Sen. He had
suspected this would occur, though. He had managed to predict where
the cloud would accelerate, so he adjusted his aim in front of the
red cloud.</p>
<p>It wouldn’t matter how fast the red cloud was if an attack was
moving through its flight path.</p>
<p>But instead of continuing forward at the same speed, the red
cloud immediately slowed down again. Han Sen’s attack went
harmlessly past it.</p>
<p>“Tricky little thing.” Han Sen frowned, but he kept on
swinging.</p>
<p>Lone Bamboo and Han Sen continued their assault on the red cloud
without making contact. The red cloud could not escape, though, as
it was constantly forced to avoid the attacks of the two.</p>
<p>“Now!” Han Sen was calculating all of the red cloud’s possible
escape routes, and he kept waving his Blood Feather Knife like mad.
He created a net with his knife silks to ensnare the foe.</p>
<p>But the red cloud did not stop moving, and its speed was
teleportation-like. The knife silks were unable to even touch
it.</p>
<p>Seeing the red cloud accelerate yet again, Han Sen finally
realized something. This creature wasn’t using a sudden burst of
speed as it tried to escape, as a rabbit might. This creature
always moved this fast. It suddenly made sense that the creature
was never afraid.</p>
<p>The red cloud was traveling around like a rocket, leaving behind
a wake of red mist. It soon became apparent that the creature had
used its contrails to write the word stupid.</p>
<p>“D*mn, this guy is smart! It can use the common language.” Han
Sen’s eyes opened wide as he stared at the clouds.</p>
<p>“It’s just a Marquise, but when the Sky came here, it already
lived on Rainbow Cloud Peak. After all these years, its
intelligence and power must way exceed that of an ordinary cloud
beast. But Marquise is the highest level one can achieve here.
There are no resources to support a higher tier than that. If there
were, it would be even more powerful,” Lone Bamboo said.</p>
<p>“Don’t worry. When I catch him, we’ll take him for a walk and
level him up quick,” Han Sen said, while looking at the red
cloud.</p>
<p>The red cloud soared through the air with great speed. The red
mist contrails started to spell out another word: bullshit. And
then, the red clouds formed an emoji that seemed to look down on
them in disdain.</p>
<p>And then, the clouds started to twist. They formed a red hand,
producing one lifted finger at Han Sen.</p>
<p>“Damn! This guy is a troll!” Han Sen summoned his dragon wings
and took off after the red cloud.</p>
<p>As the red cloud sped up and evaded his knife air, Han Sen
flapped his dragon wings and appeared above the creature.</p>
<p>And then, Han Sen struck downwards. As he did, he said, “You
b*stard! Try being cocky now.”</p>
<p>There was only a small distance to close, but Han Sen’s knife
could not match the speed of the red cloud. His knife only needed
to move the distance of a hair’s thickness, but the knife air could
not catch up. The creature sped away, widening the distance between
them again.</p>
<p>Han Sen watched as the creature ran away, and then the clouds
twisted into a smug emoji. It looked as if the emoji was having a
smoke.</p>
<p>Han Sen smiled evilly and used Blood Feather Knife. Invisible
knife silks were spun into a net, and they were sent flying over to
the red cloud.</p>
<p>The red cloud hit the knife silks, but the cloud itself was like
tofu, and it was sheared away.</p>
<p>Han Sen controlled the knife silks well, though. He had no plan
to kill it just yet.</p>
<p>“How cocky are you going to be now?” Han Sen shouted at the red
cloud.</p>
<p>Suddenly, the cloud accelerated again. It went towards the knife
silks, but it was cut to pieces by the fine strands.</p>
<p>Han Sen frowned. He only wanted to teach the beast a lesson, not
kill it.</p>
<p>The red cloud didn’t hesitate, though. It maintained course,
still flying with blinding speed. The knife silks cut it to
ribbons, but those ribbons gathered back into one cottony cloud.
Then it presented Han Sen the shape of a thumbs down.</p>
<p>“That stupid cloud is strong!” Han Sen thought. “That’s f*cking
creepy.”</p>
<p>It was incredibly fast, and its body could be shattered. Han Sen
wasn’t sure how that thing could be caught.</p>
<p>Lone Bamboo tried to snare it a few times, but he failed every
time, too. They were the two fastest Marquise there were, but they
were unable to catch up with the red cloud.</p>
<p>Even if Han Sen used teleport to reach the red cloud and attack,
the red cloud’s speed and reaction times would still enable it to
dodge the knife airs and shockwaves. The longer they tried to
capture the red cloud, the more they respected it. Not even a Duke
could handle this creature.</p>
<p>Even if he hit the cloud, there was no point. It had a body that
was like water, and after parts of it were lopped off, it’d just
recompose easily.</p>
<p>Lone Bamboo spun his jade sword into something that resembled a
tornado. The giant sword air vortex reached out to the red cloud,
trying to suck the creature inside.</p>
<p>The red cloud sped up and escaped the grasp of the sword vortex.
Even that was ineffective.</p>
<p>There was nothing Lone Bamboo could do against it, and he had
lost against it just like Han Sen.</p>
<p>“It’s no wonder it has survived this long, and it still hasn’t
been tamed by Sky Palace students. This thing is powerful!” Lone
Bamboo mused.</p>
<p>“It is, but it cannot attack,” Han Sen said.</p>
<p>There was currently no hope in catching up to the red cloud, so
Lone Bamboo abandoned the quest for the moment. He said, “I will
catch a normal Marquise cloud beast. What about you?”</p>
<p>“It’s fine. I have my Legless Crane. I don’t want to swap it
out.” Han Sen shook his head. Unless he found something like the
red cloud, he could run faster than a normal Marquise xenogeneic,
anyway. There was no point in getting another random mount. The
Legless Crane was enough for him.</p>
<p>Lone Bamboo caught a Marquise cloud bird. It didn’t take much to
catch it. Ordinary Marquise creatures were slower than Lone Bamboo,
and he managed to nab it with ease.</p>
<p>When Han Sen and Lone Bamboo were just about to leave, the cocky
red cloud followed them. It flew in front of them and spelled out
more words with the vapor. “Dumb<em>ss! Dumb</em>ss! Come and catch
me.”</p>
<p>Han Sen’s eyebrows rose. That beast could use an exclamation
mark.</p>
<p>“Fuck! I have to take you. Othewise, I am done calling myself
Han Sen.” Han Sen felt angry, but he did not turn around He knew he
couldn’t catch the red cloud right now. But he would find a way to
get it eventually.</p>
