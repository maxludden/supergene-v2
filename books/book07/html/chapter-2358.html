<h2>Weird Area</h2>
<h3>Chapter 2358</h3>

<p>Normal bullets would face too much resistance when fired
underwater. The shot would become weaker the farther it had to
travel, and the sea conch would likely notice its approach.</p>
<p>But Han Sen had his Original Water King Body and sea dragon
area. He combined with the sea of Planet Water Zone itself. He used
his water powers to create Spell’s ammunition, so the bullet also
had water abilities. Rather than being slowed down by the water it
passed through, the bullet was actually buffed by the sea. It flew
toward the sea conch silently, like a phantom.</p>
<p>But Han Sen wasn’t firing at the exposed flesh of the creature.
He was firing at the conch’s shell.</p>
<p>Pang!</p>
<p>The bullet hit the sea conch’s shell, punching a small hole
straight through. The sea conch shook and immediately activated its
blue light. The light quickly covered the sea conch’s shell,
protecting the small hole.</p>
<p>“So that’s how it works.” Han Sen was happier. He looked at the
bullet hole and noticed that some white juice was flowing out of
it. Although the wound was very small, it proved that his bullets
could pierce through the shell and damage the creature’s body.</p>
<p>Now Han Sen knew for certain that the light made the conch’s
shell so hard, not the material of the conch shell itself.</p>
<p>Han Sen’s shot was far weaker than the blood kirin’s attacks,
too. But still, his bullets were able to penetrate the conch’s
shell. The blood kirin’s claws were only able to leave light
scratch marks upon it. It was obvious by now that the difference
was because of the blue light area.</p>
<p>Han Sen stayed where he was and lifted his sniper rifle to aim
at the sea conch again. He fired a few times, all of his bullets
flying true and striking the shell.</p>
<p>None of those bullets were able to break the conch’s shell,
though. Under the glow of the blue light, they left small marks on
the surface of the shell.</p>
<p>“When the bullets go through the blue area, they don’t lose
speed or power. But when they strike the conch’s shell, they don’t
have the impact that they should.” Han Sen looked at the sea conch
with interest.</p>
<p>After a while, the bullet hole Han Sen had made filled in and
disappeared completely. The conch’s recovery power was very
strong.</p>
<p>“No wonder Bai Yi left behind a King xenogeneic. He probably
couldn’t figure out how to kill it; he didn’t leave it alive
because he wanted to.” Han Sen laughed.</p>
<p>Since Bai Yi had been unable to kill it, this was a good
opportunity for Han Sen. He and the blood kirin remained in hiding,
and he was determined to kill the King class xenogeneic.</p>
<p>He only had guesses about how to bring the creature down,
though. He didn’t have a surefire way of breaking the blue light
area, so he planned to wait there until the sea conch relaxed.</p>
<p>The sea conch had learned from Han Sen’s previous attack, and it
didn’t reveal itself so quickly this time. It took a few hours
before the sea conch was willing to reveal its flesh once more.</p>
<p>This time, however, it didn’t deactivate its blue light. It
continued using the blue area as it traveled into the deeper
recesses of the sea.</p>
<p>Han Sen thought the thing would be heavy and slow, but it ran
away like a rabbit. Han Sen watched the small mountain flee into
the deep sea, creating eddies and vortexes as it went.</p>
<p>Han Sen used his Purple-Eye Butterfly to keep an eye on the
thing as he pursued it, waiting for the moment the creature decided
to relax.</p>
<p>Now that the sea conch had been damaged, it was being careful.
It was moving fast, and it carefully maintained its King area the
entire time.</p>
<p>Han Sen wasn’t in a rush, though. He just continued to follow
it. The creature was too big to hide from him easily.</p>
<p>Plus, Han Sen had two water areas. Escaping from him in the
water would be practically impossible. Han Sen was very confident
in his water-aligned powers.</p>
<p>But Han Sen noticed that his current confidence had come a
little too soon. When the sea conch passed by another underwater
mountain, it disappeared.</p>
<p>After it climbed behind the mountain, it didn’t re-emerge. Han
Sen thought it might have come back to its home, but when he looked
around the mountain, he couldn’t find the sea conch anywhere.</p>
<p>“Weird. Where did it go?” Han Sen looked around, but he saw no
sign of the creature.</p>
<p>The gap between the mountains was small, so there was nowhere
else for it to go. The sea conch was too big for Han Sen to have
missed it if it came out. That was why Han Sen waited near the
mountain.</p>
<p>But there was nothing to see. The sea conch had truly
vanished.</p>
<p>“You think you can escape my sight that simply? You are too
naive.” Han Sen used his Purple-Eye Butterfly and his Dongxuan Aura
to scan for the sea conch’s molecular trail. He found it and began
following.</p>
<p>Han Sen quickly realized that there was a small hole in the
ground near the mountain. The hole was the size of a man’s fist.
The sea conch’s trail disappeared into it. The conch had tricked
him.</p>
<p>“That sea conch can change its size? Why didn’t it display that
power earlier?” Han Sen wondered.</p>
<p>“Blood kirin, go in and take a look at what it’s doing. But
don’t alert it to your presence.” Han Sen wasn’t very good at
changing the size of his body, but the blood kirin was a
professional. It could change its size effortlessly.</p>
<p>The blood kirin roared. Its body shook as its bones shrank. It
became one size smaller, and then it continued to reduce until the
red beast looked like a little toy. Then, it climbed into the
hole.</p>
<p>Han Sen waited on the outside. He looked around and examined the
trench that led to the hole.</p>
<p>Han Sen had studied the Xuanmen techniques left behind by Mister
White. He learned a few of the skills, but they were very simple.
He only mastered a couple of their methods of calculation, but if a
situation was quite simple, he could use those techniques to
provide some insight.</p>
<p>The underwater mountain was very special. There were many
mountains nearby, and they were all connected together. The
mountains were shaped like volcanoes with craters at the top, and
there were large holes in the peaks.</p>
<p>From above, the nine mountains looked like a chain of
interlocking rings. Han Sen remembered in the Xuanmen technique
that this kind of environment was called the Nine Rings.</p>
<p>If that sort of landscape was in the Alliance, no one would have
dared to live there. Such a place had a lot of bad luck, and people
who chose to live there would suffer the consequences.</p>
<p>But that theory might not have applied to the geno universe.
Mister White said the Xuanmen techniques required many improvements
for the geno universe. Techniques and powers were different in the
sanctuary and the geno universe, and he was interested in
researching those differences.</p>
<p>Han Sen was checking out the mountain when a white shadow
suddenly appeared from the peaks. It was a big electric eel that
was a dozen meters long. As it swam, its white scales sparked with
electricity. It looked weirdly pretty.</p>
<p>“Another King class xenogeneic!” Han Sen frowned. This was
unexpected.</p>
