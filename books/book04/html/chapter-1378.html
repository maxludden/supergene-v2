    <p>“Who do you think the new master will be?”</p>
    <p>“Metal Demon, that robo-boy’s geno core is indestructible.”</p>
    <p>“Nah, my boy Six-Ear. That tiger eats metal scrap for breakfast.”</p>
    <p>
      “Hmm, I saw them chase two spirits out. It has to be one of them. Perhaps
      they’re even co-operating.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “I still think Metal Demon should be the master. He’s a cool guy, and
      there’s not a bad circuit in his body.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Well, let’s be honest here; as long as it’s not a spirit, we’re good. If
      a spirit takes the mantle, we’re all going to have to sign contracts.”
    </p>
    <p>“Yeah, I hope it isn’t a spirit. Spirits are trash.”</p>
    <p>
      As the crowd formed to gossip, speculate, and await the reveal of their
      new master, something appeared and walked out before them.
    </p>
    <p>
      Everyone went deathly silent when they saw. If the next master wasn’t up
      to par and was not very favorable, there was every chance of them leaving.
    </p>
    <p>
      Six-Ear and Metal Demon came out together. They did so side-by-side in a
      fine condition; it did not look as if they had done any fighting. But
      then, they parted. Someone else was coming, walking through the center to
      overtake them both.
    </p>
    <p>
      It looked like a spirit was going to assert the mantle, or at least,
      that’s what their first glance told them. They quickly sought to run off
      and abandon the shelter, in fear of entrapment. They thought a spirit had
      taken the shelter over, and that it had already claimed Six-Ear and Metal
      Demon.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sparing an additional second to see who it was before racing off, the
      audience then noticed it wasn’t a spirit. It was almost too short to be
      one, and surprisingly, the person looked rather similar to Nan Litian.
    </p>
    <p>
      “It’s a human!” A number of them balked, in unison. This came as a grand
      surprise for each and every one of them.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hardly anyone there knew Han Sen, and so they wondered where he had come
      from and what had led him to becoming their new master.
    </p>
    <p>
      Green Cow looked at Han Sen from down below and asked aloud, to the
      attention of no one in particular, “How did that bloke get into the spirit
      hall, moo-moo?”
    </p>
    <p>
      Su Minhua was equally confused. He believed he and Nan Litian to be the
      only humans in the remote proximity of Shadow Shelter.
    </p>
    <p>
      As the creatures all mulled about in confusion, Metal Demon stepped
      forward to speak. “From now on, Han Sen will be the new master of Shadow
      Shelter. If I see any disobedience, I will subject the rowdy party to a
      fierce shredding.”
    </p>
    <p>
      Six-Ear, the white tiger, then let out a roar to agree with what the robot
      had said.
    </p>
    <p>
      All in the assembly were in shock. Each and every one of them could not
      believe their latest master was another human, and what’s more, he had
      garnered the full support of the two standing at his side.
    </p>
    <p>
      Only Su Minhua was truly delighted to know a new human would be the latest
      master.
    </p>
    <p>
      “He’s the new master?” Green Cow again spoke aloud. She struggled to keep
      her thoughts inside her mind, and now, her eyes, too. They almost fell out
      of their sockets, as she struggled to comprehend the fact that the man she
      had tried to half-swindle was to be the new master of the shelter.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Don’t expect much change. The rules you knew before are still in place.
      No oath or contract is put upon you to remain here. Your freedom is
      intact, and you can all continue living here. So, rock on, I guess.” Han
      Sen finally spoke, with a casual tone of voice that sought to comfort any
      fears they were harboring.
    </p>
    <p>
      Han Sen wanted them all to feel safe. The more people who happily lived
      there, the more taxes he’d be able to receive. With Six Ear and Metal
      Demon by his side, the fears of the shelter’s occupants were soon laid to
      rest, and business swiftly returned to normal.
    </p>
    <p>
      Han Sen gave them the mine and garden, as was promised in the bargain they
      had made. That wealth was also payment for them to remain in the shelter
      as guards for Han Sen. They would also maintain order in the shelter while
      he was away.
    </p>
    <p>
      Han Sen returned to the spirit hall, where Moment Queen was waiting for
      him.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Is something wrong? Or did you just drink a glass of curdled milk?” Han
      Sen asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      Moment Queen was quick with her response, and with obvious concern, she
      asked, “Are you going to stay in this place for long?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Yes.” Han Sen knew there would be no strong creatures or spirits nearby
      that could threaten him. It was a well-built shelter that had come with a
      pre-installed army.
    </p>
    <p>
      His biggest enemy would be the blonde spirit he had faced earlier and made
      quick work of. Han Sen was only going to get stronger in the time to come,
      so even if the spirit returned to try his luck once more, Han Sen did not
      fear him. And in the days to come, Han Sen would make it his objective to
      max out his primitive and mutant geno point tallies.
    </p>
    <p>
      “I hope you can spend some time to open the Geno Core Storage,” Moment
      Queen said.
    </p>
    <p>“Can you have one here?” Han Sen asked.</p>
    <p>Old Man Ji had already told Han Sen about Geno Core Storages before.</p>
    <p>
      They were similar to the spirit bases, in that they were individual places
      that had access points across the sanctuary. The only real difference was
      the fact you needed a geno core to gain access.
    </p>
    <p>
      No matter what race you were, as long as you had a geno core, you could
      gain access. However, when you were inside, you could only bring along one
      geno core, and that would be the one used for access. For your time there,
      all the others were off-limits.
    </p>
    <p>
      Whenever you beat an enemy, you’d receive an item that could reinforce
      geno cores.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was also a tiered place, too. You had to ascend the ranks, unable to
      skip any. Everyone had a ranking there, but it was one that was tied to
      the geno core used.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the Gold Geno Core Storage, Old Man Ji was ranked somewhere around
      eight million. Han Sen was interested in learning more about the Geno Core
      Storage, though, ideally from first-hand experience.
    </p>
    <p>
      “I wonder what the rank my umbrella and egg are. It would be great if I
      could reach the top ten,” Han Sen thought to himself.
