    <p>
      &#8220;Is this the bonepool and Third-Life Bonefish?&#8221; Han Sen asked
      with a frown.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;I don&#8217;t know. If it isn&#8217;t, it has to be fairly similar.
      Perhaps it is a sub-species?&#8221; Moment Queen said.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Then, how am I able to get the fish out of there?&#8221; Han Sen
      was still extremely fixated on its retrieval. Even if the creature in the
      pool wasn&#8217;t the Third-Life Bonefish that she had spoken of, it had
      to be something good.
    </p>

    <p>
      And if he confirmed its identity, then he would have no choice but to get
      it out of the pool and slay it. It would be an educational venture.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;I have not learnt of a way to ensnare a Third-Life Bonefish, and
      similar to your troubles, that all stems from the difficulty posed by the
      bonepool it inhabits.&#8221; Moment Queen shook her head.
    </p>

    <p>
      There was a treasure in front of Han Sen, but it was currently
      unobtainable. It was like a terrible itch. But just as Han Sen frowned in
      contemplation, his pocket vibrated. Then, the scallop shell magically
      removed itself from the pocket and flew over near the pool.
    </p>

    <p>
      The fairy exited the shell, reached out her delicate hand towards Moment
      Queen and wiggled her index finger left and right. It was like she was
      saying, &#8220;You are wrong.&#8221;
    </p>

    <p>
      She was visibly upset about Moment Queen&#8217;s assertion of no one being
      able to enter the water. She flew near the pool and spat frosty air out
      across the surface of the water.
    </p>

    <p>The water in the pool began to freeze over relatively quickly.</p>

    <p>
      The fairy kept the icy pressure on and continued to blow frosty air until
      the entire pool was a block of ice. And as the water froze more and more,
      the fish went into a state of panic. But being unable to leave the pool,
      there was nothing it could do.
    </p>

    <p>
      As the water became ice, the fish&#8217;s movements became slower and
      slower. When it had all turned to ice, the fish was trapped inside,
      motionless.
    </p>

    <p>
      With a cocky, boisterous face, the fairy turned to look at Han Sen. Then,
      she turned back around and punched the ice with her fist. It shattered. As
      shards of ice scattered into the air and onto the ground around them, the
      fish was sent flying.
    </p>

    <p>
      With great speed, the fairy managed to catch the fish in her tiny hands.
      With the prize Han Sen sought, she flew over and did circles around him.
    </p>

    <p>
      This delighted Han Sen, and as he observed the fish the little fairy had
      obtained for him, he noticed how clean it looked. There was not a single
      speck of dirt nor a single minor blemish on it, and like it was a
      tantalizing ice lolly for a hot summer day, Han Sen grabbed it eagerly.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Well, the little fairy finally did something of value. It seems the
      time and expense I have spent treating you has finally paid off.&#8221;
      Han Sen, receiving the fish, made sure to compliment the little fairy in
      his typical deadpan way.
    </p>

    <p>
      The little fairy was a little full of herself following this, so she went
      to sit on top of Han Sen&#8217;s head. And as she settled down, she stuck
      her tongue out at Moment Queen in mockery of her inability to provide the
      aid that the fairy just had.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;You want this?&#8221; Han Sen put the iced fish in front of the
      silver fox. It nodded, then gobbled the fish up in haste.
    </p>

    <p>
      Upon its consumption, Han Sen immediately noticed the silver fox&#8217;s
      fur turning to crystal. It was quite eye-catching. Its crystallized fur
      fell to the ground as if it were shed, and new fur took its place.
    </p>

    <p>
      That such a small fish could provide such grand changes to the silver fox
      surprised Han Sen.
    </p>

    <p>
      But then Han Sen suddenly thought of something. Although the silver fox
      was aligned with the element of thunder, he did possess the ability to
      heal the wounds of others. With its medical licks, its healing abilities
      had proven useful for Han Sen on numerous occasions.
    </p>

    <p>
      But he hadn&#8217;t relied on the silver fox as much, ever since Han Sen
      himself had learnt how to heal through a simulation of the holy
      rhino&#8217;s energy flow.
    </p>

    <p>
      After shooting it with the bolt, Han Sen noticed that the little fish had
      managed to heal itself rapidly. It most likely possessed healing
      capabilities, which was what attracted the silver fox to it so much.
    </p>

    <p>
      After the silver fox finished evolving, it leapt up into Han Sen&#8217;s
      arms. It rubbed its head against Han Sen&#8217;s chest and looked
      ecstatic.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen stroked the silver fox&#8217;s head, wondering why a creature with
      the power of thunder could also heal. It was a unique combo for the silver
      fox to have.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;I wonder where Little Silver came from? When I found it, it was
      merely an egg I discovered in a valley renown for snakes. There
      aren&#8217;t really any leads I can follow up on.&#8221; Han Sen did not
      take his thoughts any further than that. Ultimately, he decided, it did
      not matter where it came from.
    </p>

    <p>
      But in recent times, a certain uneasy feeling began to nag at him. He
      worried that, despite his connection with the silver fox, it really was
      just a creature. If it wanted to enter the Third God&#8217;s Sanctuary
      alongside Han Sen, it would need a breakthrough of sorts. And even if it
      could ascend to the Third God&#8217;s Sanctuary, there was no guarantee
      they would end up at the same shelter together.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;I hope our distance won&#8217;t be too great.&#8221; Han Sen could
      only hope.
    </p>

    <p>…&#8230;</p>

    <p>
      Luo Yin had spent much time searching for Han Sen, but had not yet been
      able to discover his whereabouts. He had, however, been informed of his
      recent appearance at a human shelter. Going there to investigate, he was
      still unable to locate him. All he could do after that was wait for
      another trail to pick up.
    </p>

    <p>
      He was very curious about Han Sen, thinking the Falsified-Sky Sutra was
      the strongest hyper geno art in existence. And he did not understand why
      Han Sen, despite sharing the family&#8217;s blood, refused to learn it.
    </p>

    <p>
      Sometimes Luo Yin wished himself to be of true lineage to the Luo family,
      adamant in the belief of his inability of failing Luo Haitang.
    </p>

    <p>
      It was indeed a shame he was not of the Luo bloodline. He was initially a
      distant relative, but he was adopted by Luo Haitang and later taught the
      skill.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;I need to make Han Sen understand what he&#8217;s missing out on,
      by not learning the Falsified-Sky Sutra,&#8221; Luo Yin thought to
      himself.
    </p>

    <p>As Luo Yin thought this, he suddenly saw a man walk by the gate.</p>

    <p>
      The figure had a tall and strong body. The person had a young face, with
      skin that was pale and a little pink. It was the sort of face that would
      make any woman jealous.
    </p>

    <p>
      On the man&#8217;s shoulder rested a lazy-looking silver fox, and an
      elephant-like lion trotted behind them. Its back was loaded with things.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Han Sen!&#8221; Luo Yin&#8217;s eyes shone brightly, having never
      seen Han Sen in person before. All that he had seen were pictures and
      videotapes of the man. He believed that he knew Han Sen&#8217;s appearance
      better than he did his own.
    </p>

    <p>
      Without hesitation, Luo Yin approached him. He came with one purpose, and
      that was to educate Han Sen in how powerful the Falsified-Sky Sutra really
      was as a skill.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen, seeing Luo Yin approach, looked surprised. He recognized him from
      their prior encounter, when Han Sen had assumed his Dollar persona.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;What is it?&#8221; Han Sen looked at Luo Yin, who was standing in
      front of him.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;You are Han Sen?&#8221; Luo Yin wasn&#8217;t very fond of trouble,
      and neither did he like to beat around the bush. He wasn&#8217;t going to
      waste any more time, so all he wanted to do after getting confirmation on
      his identity was to immediately reveal the power of the Falsified-Sky
      Sutra.
    </p>

    <p>
      Without saying another word, Luo Yin threw his hand forward in an attempt
      to slash Han Sen. An invisible power flew towards him, on-track as if it
      was its fate to damage him.
