  They were unable to find Alang, so Miss Mirror brought Han Sen back to the peak. Fortunately, Han Sen only seemed to have a case of the flu. It wasn’t as big as a deal as it could have been.

Back on the peak, Miss Mirror had someone erect a tent for Han Sen so he could rest.

Han Sen felt incredibly dizzy. He didn’t try to fight through it and stay on his feet, though. He just slept beneath a blanket. It wasn’t as if he could challenge Miss Mirror, even if he wanted to. If the woman sought to bring him harm, he would be unable to fight back.

And no one could do anything to Han Sen since Miss Mirror was keeping watch over him. Plus, the blood kirin was happy to guard Han Sen’s tent. Thus, Han Sen was able to sleep soundly.

Because Han Sen felt so dizzy, it wasn’t long before he slipped into a sound sleep. He didn’t know how long he was asleep, but when he finally woke up, he felt considerably better. His symptoms had vanished.

He stretched and climbed out of the tent, then immediately froze.

He had gone to sleep in a tent atop a mountain, but now he climbed out onto a white beach. The tide was lapping against the shore only a few short meters away, the gentle waves breaking across the sand.

Han Sen turned around and realized he was on a small island. He could see every inch of the small island with just one pan of the head.

That island was no bigger than a baseball pitch, and two palm trees stood close by. The sight made Han Sen frown.

It was very surprising that someone had been able to teleport Han Sen there, especially under the watchful gaze of Miss Mirror. She was supremely powerful, after all.

Although Han Sen didn’t know the full extent of Miss Mirror’s powers, she was King Bai’s right hand. That had to be some sort of proof she was a beast.

The blood kirin was still standing guard outside the tent, but it seemed strangely calm. If it had been teleported away with him, and it showed no reaction.

While Han Sen was thinking, a wave that was a few hundred meters tall suddenly spawned in the sea. It came for the island like a mountain collapsing, and the roar it made sounded like the end of the world.

Han Sen’s stomach dropped, and he quickly used The Story of Genes. Because his body was so packed with Kingese, The Story of Genes was the only geno art he could run smoothly.

But the wave didn’t break across the island. It stopped in place, hovering right before the landmass. The water gathered up into the face of a giant sea god. It glared down on Han Sen, who was still on the island.

“Who are you? Why did you bring me here?” Han Sen asked the giant sea god thing.

“You don’t remember me?” the sea god growled.

Han Sen did think the face was rather familiar, so he looked closer. He soon noticed that the face that had been composed by that swelling of water was none other than Alang’s.

“Alang?” Han Sen was surprised.

“I am the alpha of water. I am Ancient Water God.” The sea god’s voice sounded like a tsunami. The sky changed color, and a harsh wind blew, making Han Sen’s clothes flap madly. The volume was so loud, Han Sen felt as if his eardrums would rupture.

“You are Ancient Water God?” Han Sen was frozen. He seemed to remember that he had told Alang he was going to eat the Water God Origin.

“No wonder Alang’s expression looked so weird when I said that, because…” Han Sen wanted to slap himself. He wished he hadn’t said something so stupid out loud; those were thoughts that he really should have kept to his inner-ramblings. Han Sen knew wallowing in regret would be pointless now, though. He coughed twice to Ancient Water God and said, “Mister God, please don’t be mad. I was only kidding around.”

“You were joking?” Ancient Water God made an expression that was almost like a smile, but not quite.

“Yeah, it was just a joke.” Han Sen nodded. He kept casting The Story of Genes. He wasn’t arrogant enough to think he could withstand the might of a deified being.

Now, he could only think about running. Luckily, Ancient Water God was on the verge of becoming a god spirit. Han Sen needed to escape back to the sanctuary, wait until the deified died as he tried to level up, then come back after.

The worst thing was, Han Sen’s body was too full of Kingese to cast the Blood-Pulse Sutra. He couldn’t use his Blood-Pulse Powers to return to the sanctuary.

“Allow me to continue the joke,” Ancient Water God said. His body shattered and became a heavy storm. It was going to drown the entire island.

The water poured down around Han Sen, soaking his clothes. He looked like a wet chicken, but he wasn’t injured. The Ancient Water God hadn’t put any power into the water, so it just felt like a particularly intense rainstorm.

“I was just talking. I didn’t actually do anything. You don’t have to be this mad at me,” Han Sen said, feeling frustrated.

Boom!

Ancient Water God didn’t appear again, but something exploded through the water not too far away. A silver dragon had emerged from the sea, and its silver light gleamed like the glory of the sun. Silver rain showered from the creature, and its presence was pretty terrifying.

Roar!

The silver-winged dragon roared into the air, and its silver king area spread to cover everything in sight. Han Sen’s body felt as if it was stuck in the mud, and he could barely move.

The silver-winged dragon opened its enormous mouth, revealing silver light that looked like a swirling galaxy. It was going to consume Han Sen’s body.

The silver-winged dragon came to consume Han Sen, and he found himself standing right in front of its gaping maw, no larger than one of the dragon’s teeth.

In the silver-winged dragon’s king area, Han Sen found it hard to move. He wouldn’t be able to avoid the silver-winged dragon’s attack. As The Story of Genes continued to run, he reached out and wrapped both of his hands around one of the dragon’s teeth. It was like two bulls colliding, and he tried to stop the silver-wing dragon.

The silver-wing dragon’s weight slammed into Han Sen, pushing him down into the sea.

Han Sen held tightly to the dragon tooth as his body was shoved deeper and deeper into the water. He couldn’t stop the beast.

Han Sen ran The Story of Genes as hard as it would go, attempting to shove back the silver-winged power.

As the dragon plunged through the water, it created a substantial backdraft. If Han Sen let go, he would be pulled into the dragon’s mouth.

The silver-winged dragon was scary. Han Sen struggled to keep his grip on the dragon tooth, but the water pummeled his body constantly. He trembled under the force, and he felt as if his arms were going to get ripped off by the power.

Boom!

Suddenly, Han Sen’s body was shining gold. Gold light beamed from every inch of his body, interspersed with tiny symbols.

Because of the silver-winged dragon’s attack, the Kingese inside of him had activated.

The gold Kingese cycled furiously through his body, making Han Sen feel as if an endless amount of power was now coursing through his veins. The scariest thing was, it felt like everything in existence was lending him power. Mountain and valley, sun and moon, and every plant in existence were all fueling Han Sen’s strength.
