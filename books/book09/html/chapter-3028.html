<p>“Han Sen!” Everybody knew that it was Han Sen in front of the
geno hall.</p>
<p>Han Sen was standing near it. He looked at Qin Xiu but did not
do anything.</p>
<p>Qin Xiu saw Han Sen and coldly said, “This is not a place you
should be.” Han Sen heard his words. He knew that back in the holy
garden, Qin Xiu’s soul was not so simple. Qin Xiu recognized him.
All he did was interact with Qin Xiu’s soul.</p>
<p>“I do not want to be here, but you have done something that made
me come,” Han Sen said while looking at Qin Xiu.</p>
<p>2 Cu</p>
<p>“What thing?” Qin Xiu kept suppressing God, but he still had the
strength to talk to Han Sen. His face did not change. It looked
like he still had a whole heap of power.</p>
<p>“Leave that body,” Han Sen said. “He does not belong to
you.”</p>
<p>Qin Xiu looked at Han Sen and asked, “Is this body related to
you?”</p>
<p>“It is my son,” Han Sen said. It was not just Qin Xiu that was
shocked by this revelation. All the elites outside the geno hall
heard what was spoken and reacted similarly.</p>
<p>No one would have been able to guess Qin Xiu’s reborn body was
Han Sen’s son. Everyone’s expressions changed. Qin Xiu laughed.
“Good, Old Cat! Good plan! It is no wonder he gave me this body.
That explains why. If it was you, I would have to be wary.”</p>
<p>Sky Palace Leader and the Very High Leader looked at each other.
They could tell the other was shocked. Qin Xiu was not scared of
facing God Spirits that were above Reboot class God Spirits.</p>
<p>Now, he was saying something like this, and these were not
insane words.</p>
<p>They still did not understand why Qin Xiu was scared of Han Sen.
If it was because Han Sen had blue blood power and managed to
defeat Moment God, then it made no sense.</p>
<p>Blue blood power came from Qin Xiu. If Han Sen received blue
blood power from someone and that made him afraid, no one would
have believed it.</p>
<p>Qin Xiu said, “Although I am sorry, I cannot give you this body.
If you want to use Wan’er to threaten me, you are wrong.” “Is that
one person you said not Wan’er?” Han Sen wanted to use Wan’er to
swap for Littleflower, but he did not expect Qin Xiu to close down
that prospect already.</p>
<p>“You are right. I can do anything for Wan’er. I also know that
if I cannot break the geno hall, then it would be pointless even if
Wan’er lived.” Qin Xiu laughed and said, “Plus, I know that you are
not a person who is selfish and would be so willing to do something
so cruel to an innocent girl.”</p>
<p>“Maybe I am like you and am willing to commit any crime for the
safety of one person,” Han Sen coldly replied. Qin Xiu smiled even
harder. “In that case, you won’t hurt Wan’er because she is my
life. Without her life, I cannot live. If I cannot live, this body
will die.”</p>
<p>“So, that leaves you and me with the need to fight.” Han Sen
knew there was no point in talking any further. Swapping
Littleflower for Wan’er wasn’t going to be possible. “No one can
stop me from destroying the geno hall, and that includes you,” Qin
Xiu said. “As a reward for taking care of Wan’er, I will not kill
you.</p>
<p>“I will,” Han Sen coldly said.</p>
<p>Qin Xiu coldly laughed. He said, “I am not looking down on you,
as your body has my blood coursing through its veins. You are like
my clone. Do you think a clone can be better than the real
stuff?”</p>
<p>“We will just have to find out, won’t we?” Han Sen cast
Blood-Pulse Sutra. His entire body glowed with a blue light.</p>
<p>“Are you using my power to fight me? You are too naïve.” Qin Xiu
had a cold expression. Blue symbols flickering across his armor. He
was not fighting Han Sen. He still kept God suppressed. It was like
Han Sen was not worth his attention.</p>
<p>The blue light in Han Sen grew stronger. He approached Qin Xiu.
Every step he took became stronger. He was like a battle god
prepared to fight the sky.</p>
<p>Qin Xiu asked, “Can you practice my blue blood gene to such a
high level? That is very shocking. Compared to me back then, it
isn’t too bad. But now? I am not the old me. Plus, that power
belongs to me. No one can use my powers to hurt me.”</p>
<p>Han Sen did not say anything. He threw a punch at Qin Xiu. A
scary blue light ripped the rules and everything around. A power
that could destroy the world was headed straight for Qin Xiu.</p>
<p>Blue blood power did not fit into the rules of the universe, and
this power dealt a lot of damage to the rules of the universe. Han
Sen’s punch was able to break a big system.</p>
<p>An elite like Moment God would have been killed with one
hit.</p>
<p>Faced with that scary power, Qin Xiu did not bother dodging. He
also did not bother fighting back. He allowed the scary blue light
to fall upon his back.</p>
<p>It was like a spring sun thawing the snow. As the scary blue
light hit Qin Xiu’s body, it did nothing. It melted into the armor.
The blue symbols absorbed it and grew brighter. Qin Xiu’s body was
only made stronger.</p>
<p>“I said, my power cannot hurt me,” Qin Xiu coldly said.</p>
<p>Outside the geno hall, the expressions of many elites changed.
Qin Xiu was scarier than even their wildest nightmares could have
depicted. Although they believed Han Sen could not defeat Qin Xiu,
they did not expect him to lose so badly. He had been unable to
harm Qin Xiu. He had only managed to lend him power.</p>
<p>“Really?” Han Sen’s face did not change. He gathered up power
and threw a punch at Qin Xiu.</p>
<p>This time, the light of his fists became red. It was different
from the blue. It was the opposite.</p>
<p>Qin Xiu frowned. He looked shocked. He felt a bit confused, but
he did not want to give up on breaking the geno hall. He raised his
fist and threw a punch at Han Sen’s incoming strike.</p>
<p>Blue and white, the two colors of weird power, struck Han Sen’s
blood power. The blood color dyed the blue and white colors red. In
the blink of an eye, Qin Xiu’s armor turned red.</p>
<p>“How could this happen? Did you reverse the blue blood power!”
Qin Xiu’s eyes were wide open. His body was devolving, and his
power was fading.</p>
<p>God, who was previously suppressed, was now able to fight back.
His god light was glowing. He bounced Qin Xiu, who was breaking the
geno hall, away.</p>
<p>Pang!</p>
<p>Qin Xiu’s body broke a pillar. His body devolved. The blue
patterns on his armor dimmed. The blue light in his eyes also
dimmed.</p>
