<p>Han Sen had encountered many elites in his time traveling across
the world. There had always been a few that he considered extremely
powerful.</p>
<p>None were like this Crape Myrtle, who made him feel as if he was
being put under a microscope. The man made him feel as if his body
was being watched.</p>
<p>His whole body, the whole conspiracy, and the deepest secrets he
held in his heart were all seen by the eyes of that man. There were
no longer any secrets.</p>
<p>Crape Myrtle’s fingers pointed directly at him. It did not seem
to be done in any special kind of way. It was just a random finger
aimed to touch Han Sen’s forehead.</p>
<p>There was no lightning speed. There were no shadows.. There was
no sense of this being a combat move. It was a random, ordinary
lift of one’s finger. There were no skills or anything of the sort
involved.</p>
<p>A random finger made Han Sen unsure of what to do.</p>
<p>“No… This does not work. This does not work either.” Han Sen
suddenly realized that under the eyes watching him, a very normal
finger became the strongest skill the universe had ever seen.</p>
<p>Han Sen suddenly snapped out of his daze. “Crape Myrtle’s finger
is not all that special. What is special are his eyes, which can
peer into one’s heart. With those eyes, my thoughts all seem to be
exposed. It does not matter how I want to deal with things. Crape
Myrtle seems to understand. He can turn that finger into a deadly
attack. As long as those eyes that can peer into people’s hearts
are here, how I react to the finger will be incorrect.”</p>
<p>Moon God saw how powerful that finger was, and it made her lift
her lips. “Crape Myrtle is such a bully. He is the master of the
geno hall. He is the ruler of the universe. He can use the
universe’s rule powers to look into people’s souls. He is using
that to deal with Han Sen. That is certainly quite cheap.”</p>
<p>1</p>
<p>Tai Yi shook his head. “To beat Human King, he must endure
through this trial. You know Qin Xiu has the old leader’s genes and
blood. He may not be complete, and the future says he cannot do it,
but he can see through an opponent’s soul.”</p>
<p>Moon God nodded. “How is Han Sen supposed to win? He cannot use
geno arts. He has to use his body. This is how amazing soul skills
are. They are scarier than prophecies. The future can be changed,
but the thoughts in people’s souls cannot lie. It is like Han Sen
is openly admitting his thoughts with honesty, and then fighting
per those thoughts. He can’t lie, so how is he supposed to
win?”</p>
<p>Tai Yi said, “Soldiers are weird. People who use soldiers always
win weirdly. People are always happy about it. The famous generals
that can leave dark ink stains across history always use weird ways
to win and become famous. But people always forget weird ways are
risky ways. To do something once, there is no guarantee it can be
repeated for a second time. The real generals that never lose have
no big achievements, but they can still keep on fighting without
dying. Do you know why?”</p>
<p>“Are you talking about King Path?” Moon God quietly asked.</p>
<p>Tai Yi nodded. “Spending one dollar to do something that is only
worth a dollar or spending 10 dollars to do something that is worth
10 dollars, you do not earn more than you should or lose more than
you should. If 10 people fight five people, the 10 are bound to
win. If 1,000 people battle 800 people, the 1,000 must win. To tell
your opponent about everything, the opponent cannot win. They only
watch and lose. Do what you can. Do not take risks. This is the
King Path.”</p>
<p>“King Path is a battle of power. If Han Sen’s body was normal,
he could use King Path to take down Crape Myrtle, but his body is
currently unable to use powers. Therefore, how can he use King
Path?” Moon God did not realize that.</p>
<p>“That entirely depends on whether or not Han Sen can take it to
the next stage.” Tai Yi gave her a useless answer.</p>
<p>Han Sen’s heart felt like it was fighting the sky and a human.
It did not matter if he made a move. It did not matter if he
fought. It did not matter if he evaded. He could not escape that
menacing finger. Losing seemed like the only way.</p>
<p>If he tried to retreat, Crape Myrtle’s attacks would continue,
and he would be unable to get away.</p>
<p>Han Sen knew King Path, and he knew more than Tai Yi. He thought
about King Path enabling him to break Crape Myrtle’s finger, but it
was just as Moon God said. He had no power. How was he supposed to
use King Path?</p>
<p>A small soldier facing a million big soldiers was not a King
Path. Even if a real king was left alone to fight a million
soldiers, even if one spoke about King Path, it would be as funny
as a clown.</p>
<p>“What do I have now that is stronger than Crape Myrtle?” Han Sen
looked at Crape Myrtle’s fingers coming. He thought about a million
ideas, but his body did not move.</p>
<p>Seeing Crape Myrtle’s finger was coming to touch his finger, Han
Sen’s eyes opened. The god light in his eyes appeared. He leaned
his head back and used it to hit Crape Myrtle’s finger.</p>
<p>Crape Myrtle’s finger hit Han Sen on the head. Crape Myrtle was
blasted away. Han Sen clutched his head and fell to the ground with
his lips and teeth in pain.</p>
<p>“It is a very bad idea for you to use brute force.” Crape Myrtle
used another hand to rub his damaged finger. His fingertip was a
little red, but he still smiled at Han Sen.</p>
<p>“It is not about me being obscene or not. If you have power, you
should just kill me.” Han Sen smiled.</p>
<p>This sounded bad, but Han Sen had been through everything. He
did not care about his reputation.</p>
<p>Crape Myrtle squinted with his eyes. He lifted his lips, looked
at Han Sen, and smiled. “Do you think I am unable to do anything to
your body?”</p>
<p>“Yes, that is right,” Han Sen answered.</p>
<p>“OK. I will show you how I can break it.” Crape Myrtle lifted
his finger. He went for Han Sen. He was still using the same
finger.</p>
<p>In fact, if Crape Myrtle wanted to kill someone, he would not
have to use skills or powers. If he wanted to kill someone, he
would just use his thoughts.</p>
<p>The universe did not have many creatures that forced Crape
Myrtle to draw his lethal finger. It was even rarer for that finger
to ever fail to kill its target.</p>
<p>So, Crape Myrtle did not require skill. The finger was already
enough to kill gods and fairies. It could kill the universe.</p>
<p>Han Sen’s face looked a bit dim. The finger looked the same, but
he knew if Crape Myrtle really was the person he believed him to
be. That finger was not just a finger.</p>
<p>Han Sen could not think of a way in which he could break it. He
held onto his scalp tightly to hit Crape Myrtle’s finger again.</p>
<p>“Don’t you want to touch me? Now you can touch it.” Han Sen
gathered up power on his head. He was going to hit Crape Myrtle’s
finger.</p>
<p>Crape Myrtle’s finger did not change. It was just like last time
when it hit Han Sen’s head hard. This time, things were
different.</p>
<p>Han Sen’s head felt as if there was a nail inside it. It was so
painful that it felt as if it would blow up.</p>
