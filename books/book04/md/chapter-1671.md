“Come and hit me, you dumb*ss!” Wang Yuhang ran, shaking his *ss vigorously as he went. Many creatures were behind him.

It looked risky, but Wang Yuhang could run like mad. He may have been dealt a number of injuries, but none of the wounds put him in critical status.

Queen’s beautiful legs were swinging to chop foes like axes. They managed to cut a sacred-blood creature in half with a combined chop, spraying blood across her limbs.

Two more creatures, like maddened tigers, came leaping towards Queen, who was now starting to show signs of exhaustion. But she disappeared, and the two creatures ended up jumping into each other. When Queen showed up again, she was beside them. With hands like blades, she sliced both of their heads off.

Queen was like a killing machine. The Ghost Slash technique Han Sen had invented was even scarier when she used it, due to her natural dexterity with the time and space elements.

Lin Feng was colored gold, and he looked almost like a Buddha. Jing Jiwu’s powers were slightly weird, and they were used in tandem with Lin Feng’s. If he threw a punch, an enemy would get trapped and become unable to move, letting Lin Feng finish it off. Through their co-operation, they were an unstoppable force that produced even more blood for the field.

A super creature came with a roar, interrupting their killing spree.

Elysian Moon’s Elysian Umbrella opened, and every time that occurred, a new creature was sucked onto its surface. It was very strange.

Little Star was too tame, though. It didn’t even fight. All it did was use Starsea Travel to run around and avoid all damage, due to it not being able to get hit

Little Silver stood atop Little Star, as Little Star navigated the field. The furry creature cast many bolts of silver lightning to electrify the enemies below.

A few super creatures tried going after Little Star, but they couldn’t get him.

Bao’er was also on top of Little Star. She kept looking around, as if in search of something.

Wherever Little Fairy flew, a blizzard accompanied her. Many flying creatures were frozen in the air, and they fell to the ground and shattered like hailstones.

Gu Qingcheng’s face was cold. Her sword skills were powerful, but she was unable to hit Elder Yin. He was like bubblegum. Whenever you attacked, he fell back. Whenever he attacked, you fell back. His skills were very powerful, too.

Han Menger kept on firing arrows, as well. They kept on getting attracted to the Horn Beast Alpha’s horn. Many explosions were created between the two, but a victor did not yet seem decided.

Han Sen was running in between a dozen elites that hounded him. Even though he wasn’t afraid of taking on large numbers alone, he still felt a lot of pressure now.

All of his enemies were powerful, and Ancient Devil kept breathing down his neck, making him feel much worse. He was still making use of Bulwark Umbrella and Overbearing Shield to block the attacks that came his way.

Bulwark Umbrella’s surface had a small crack running across it, but Overbearing Shield was wreathed with far more. It looked as if it’d break soon.

Han Sen was using his Fallen Slaughter body and butterfly wings to dodge an attack of an elder. He shouted to Sacred’s leader, “Hey, look at who is in the Ancient Sky Mirror!”

Sacred’s leader turned around to look at the mirror, and in that big mirror, Goddess was visible. She looked terrible.

“Let her go!” Sacred’s leader roared.

“Sacred, if you don’t leave now, I will kill her,” Han Sen said coldly as he dodged attacks.

“If you touch one hair on her head, I’ll make you… PANG!” Before Sacred’s leader finished, the noise of an explosion sounded. Goddess exploded, becoming nothing more than a bloody mist across the mirror.

“I’m going to kill you!” Sacred’s leader’s eyes turned red, and he became incredibly angry.

Han Sen was so cold, and his face didn’t change. As he continued his fight, he coldly said, “Elder Mo He, if you keep moving, two of your people will suffer the same fate.”

“I will kill you today!” Elder Mo He gritted his teeth. He didn’t fall back, and he simply attacked even harder.

Han Sen’s heart jumped, and then, the two people that belonged to Mo He exploded. They became a source of energy for the mirror.

Han Sen kept on killing the others, because he didn’t think the alphas would leave. Those were their kids he was now killing, but they had many children. They weren’t going to fall back on account of two lost ones, however.

Han Sen wasn’t killing their children just to make them mad, though. He was hoping to take advantage of their emotions, but that aside, Ancient Sky Mirror required a lot of energy to keep reviving his teammates.

Many elders were enraged by the actions of Han Sen. They were able to maintain their powers, but their usage was now emotional.

Han Sen grabbed hold of the raw emotions he could and weaved his way through the elites. He was like a fish that was swimming upstream. It was a difficult situation to be in, but it was at least a little better.

Dong!

Ancient Devil threw his palm against Overbearing Shield. It reversed the power back onto Ancient Devil, but it didn’t succeed in hurting him. And the shield itself wasn’t able to fully sustain the shock. The shield ended up breaking while it was still attached to Han Sen’s arm.

This made Han Sen feel terrible. Ancient Devil was near Han Sen now, and he was a far more dangerous threat than the others were. But try as he might, Han Sen could not figure out a way in which he could rid himself of Ancient Devil. Ancient Devil was a powerful nemesis, but the white and unassuming donkey he rode was also a tricky fiend. Han Sen couldn’t figure out a way to deal with the two.

Inferno Skeleton Emperor could now feel Ancient Devil’s presence from inside Destiny’s Tower, and this made him a little nutty again. He kept on slamming the locks, wanting to fight Ancient Devil.

But Han Sen wasn’t willing to let him go free. And more than anything, Han Sen didn’t want to expose the fact that he himself was Dollar.

He was invincible in the Fourth God’s Sanctuary, but the Alliance had organizations Han Sen would not be able to deal with. If people figured out Han Sen was Dollar, there was sure to be big trouble.

And as all this occurred, in a base somewhere in the Alliance, a black tiger creature came to the man that looked like God. “Sir, they have started their operation. They are attacking Han Sen and Shadow Shelter,” the black tiger said.

“Good. Let us start, then.” The officer spoke coldly, but he looked interested.

“Yes, I will travel to Han Manor,” the black tiger said quietly. With his black geno armor to veil himself, he went to see the Han family.
