    <p>
      Luckily, the silver fox wasn&#8217;t too stubborn. Despite its craving for
      the seeds, it still leapt into Han Sen&#8217;s arms when called.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen took a long sigh, and with Queen, ran off. They didn&#8217;t draw
      near to the sea, either, so they tucked themselves into a hidden spot near
      the base of the hills.
    </p>

    <p>
      Shortly after they left, the peacock-looking bird swooped down to where
      they had been. The lobster also came ashore, madly snapping its pincers as
      it rapidly scuttled inland and up to the hill where the lotus resided.
    </p>

    <p>
      The war for the lotus had begun. After observing the lotus seeds, it
      seemed even the peacock acknowledged the fact that they weren&#8217;t yet
      ripe. So, instead of waiting, the bird turned around and screamed at the
      lobster.
    </p>

    <p>
      The lobster, with its claws snapping, skittered towards the bird. Its
      large body and shell didn&#8217;t seem to slow it down in the least.
    </p>

    <p>
      The peacock opened its wings and took off into the sky. It broadened its
      feather train like a fan in a display of hostility. Beneath its green
      plumage was a collage of impeccable eyespots that emitted a blue light.
    </p>

    <p>
      When Han Sen looked into the eyespots that decorated the peacock, he felt
      dizzy. He almost felt as if he was going to faint.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Don&#8217;t look at its blue lights,&#8221; Queen said, already
      having closed her eyes. Her purple light was swirling around inside her,
      signifying she had already activated her gene lock.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen did what she bid and also used his hands to cover the eyes of the
      silver fox, but still, the blue light somehow managed to pierce his
      eyelids.
    </p>

    <p>
      He quickly turned around and moved to hide behind a rock, which brought
      him instant relief.
    </p>

    <p>
      Queen hid behind a rock, as well, with neither of them opting to open
      their eyes for a second. For now, they could only rely on their ears.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen used Jadeskin to activate his gene lock, as it didn&#8217;t
      require him to have his eyes open. With it, he could survey the entire
      area and reconstruct the entire scene without looking.
    </p>

    <p>
      The giant lobster looked drunk as it rampaged to the left and right in
      response to the peacock&#8217;s blue light. With its foe affected so
      badly, the peacock found an opening for its attack.
    </p>

    <p>
      The lobster&#8217;s shell was unbelievably sturdy. When the peacock
      feistily pecked it, the only damage it sustained was a white scratch mark.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen watched their combat in awe. While the lobster may have seemed to
      be at a great disadvantage, its shell proved to be a most hardy defense
      for it. The peacock couldn&#8217;t do anything to hurt it.
    </p>

    <p>
      The blue light from the eyespots across the peacock&#8217;s plumage
      continued to make the lobster dizzy, however. Without being able to deal
      damage, they both seemed to be at a stalemate.
    </p>

    <p>
      But still, they had both come here for the lotus seeds. If the peacock
      could keep the lobster suppressed long enough for the plant to fully
      mature, it could quickly grab the seeds, gobble them up, and fly away. All
      while the lobster continued flailing around as if it were blind.
    </p>

    <p>&#8220;What should we do?&#8221; Han Sen asked himself.</p>

    <p>
      &#8220;There is nothing we can do. The peacock&#8217;s blue light makes
      others dizzy. Even if we closed our eyes and rushed in, our eyelids
      aren&#8217;t strong enough to block out the light entirely. And how are we
      supposed to fight two super creatures with our eyes shut? We&#8217;d be
      stabbing in the dark,&#8221; Queen replied.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen did not respond. He suddenly smelled something quite pleasant, and
      noticed it was coming from the lotus seeds.
    </p>

    <p>
      The lotus was starting to emit a red light, and a red fog crept out of it,
      masking the area in a red haze. As ominous as it looked, its scent was
      delightful, and strong enough to be smelled from every corner of the
      island.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;The seeds are about to mature!&#8221; Han Sen continued observing
      the fight between the peacock and lobster, still of a mind to get the
      seeds before anyone else could. He couldn&#8217;t wait until sometime
      after they had matured because the monsters would be upon them, swallowing
      them all in one nibble. Compared to the size of the peacock and lobster,
      the seeds weren&#8217;t even big enough to get stuck in their teeth.
    </p>

    <p>
      The silver fox looked like it wanted to jump out of Han Sen&#8217;s arms
      any second, and its ardent desire for the lotus seeds was readily
      apparent. However, when it opened its eyes to take a look, it quickly
      buried its head in Han Sen&#8217;s chest. The blue light was an extreme
      deterrent.
    </p>

    <p>
      While Han Sen was wondering whether or not he should rush over there, an
      ill feeling swept over him. A noise came from the sea.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Even more super creatures are coming?&#8221; Han Shen wondered in
      annoyed bewilderment. Using his seventh sense, he quickly surveyed the
      seaside.
    </p>

    <p>
      What he saw frightened him a great deal. All around the island, a vast
      host of different creatures had come, all of the mind to grab the lotus
      seeds for themselves. There were giant fish, giant shrimps, and even
      monstrous clams. There were many more that Han Sen could not even
      describe.
    </p>

    <p>
      A large group of creatures marched their way inland in the direction of
      the lotus.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Holy smokes?! What are these lotus seeds? The pleasant smell even
      makes them ignore the silver fox&#8217;s presence. Disregarding the
      existence of the super creatures on the island, they all seem intent on
      taking the lotus seeds for themselves.&#8221; Han Sen was more than
      surprised. It was difficult to wrap his mind around what sort of substance
      would actually incite so many ordinary creatures to muster the sort of
      courage required to go up against super creatures.
    </p>

    <p>
      In the sky, many more sea birds and flying creatures appeared. Without
      fear, they swooped down for the lotus seeds, ignoring the presence of the
      super creatures that were locked in combat.
    </p>

    <p>
      But when they entered the zone that was bathed in the peacock&#8217;s blue
      light, they all crashed to the ground. It seemed as if ordinary creatures
      could not withstand the light at all.
    </p>

    <p>
      More and more creatures arrived at the hill, only to die upon their
      immediate arrival. Some were killed by the light, others fell victim to
      the violent thrashing of the lobster and peacock. It wasn&#8217;t long
      before a vast number of bodies had collected to build a hill of their own,
      one that was dyed red.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Let&#8217;s fall back; it&#8217;s too dangerous here,&#8221; Queen
      said, as she started to retreat from the scene.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen noticed the rapid advancement of the seeds' maturity and
      didn&#8217;t want to fall back empty-handed. After mulling over what to do
      for a good while, he passed the silver fox to Queen. &#8220;Take him out
      of here; I will go and try for the seeds.&#8221;
    </p>

    <p>
      But the silver fox jumped away, not wanting to leave either. His body was
      unable to even stand straight in the light, almost as intoxicated as the
      lobster.
    </p>

    <p>
      Although the light could not deal the silver fox damage, it would have
      been difficult for it to exert the strength needed to go up, get the
      seeds, and get out.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;You get out of here. Don&#8217;t worry; I&#8217;ll give you some of
      the seeds after I collect them,&#8221; Han Sen told the silver fox.
    </p>

    <p>
      The silver fox either did not hear him or was too stubborn to leave. It
      wanted to grab the lotus seeds despite its incapacitation.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen grabbed the silver fox and forced it back. It was behaving like
      almost any other creature, giving up everything it could to take the lotus
      seeds.
    </p>

    <p>
      The peacock and the lobster were still sealed in turbulent conflict with
      one another. If any other creature tried to ascend the hill, they would be
      killed in the midst of their battle. Winning the lotus seeds would be a
      most difficult prize.
    </p>

    <p>
      All of a sudden, from inside the lotus, a bright light burst forth. It was
      red, and it beamed into the sky, widening like the bloom of a flower
      itself. The pleasant scent carried across the entire sea, urging even more
      creatures to come and battle for it.
    </p>

    <p>The lotus was ripe.</p>
