    <p>
      Han Sen watched the scorpion for a while as it continued to dig. It kept
      on digging until it vanished from sight, and all Han Sen could see was the
      remaining presence of a hole.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen summoned his wings and flew up high to get an aerial view of the
      hole. Upon inspection, he noted that the hole was a dozen meters deep and
      it eventually opened up into a cave or cavern of sorts.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;There has to be something special down there.&#8221; Han Sen was
      surprised, and so he summoned his super armor and ventured inside with his
      silver fox in hand.
    </p>

    <p>
      Once he had dropped down into the cave, he noticed the presence of an
      opening in one of the walls. He ventured closer to have a look and what he
      saw surprised him.
    </p>

    <p>
      There was a further cavern inside, one that was massive. He couldn&#8217;t
      even begin to predict how large it was. It was decorated in bamboo-like
      fauna and flora, many of which reached up to the cavern&#8217;s ceiling.
      It was an incredible sight.
    </p>

    <p>
      The twin-tailed scorpion was inside, snapping the bamboo-like plants. The
      shoots were hollow inside, but many of them contained big white bugs, not
      too dissimilar to silk worms. They were only about ten centimeters long,
      but they looked juicy and fat.
    </p>

    <p>
      The scorpion ate the white bugs and bamboo together, which produced an
      echoing munching sound.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Are those white bugs creatures, by any chance? If the scorpion is
      eating, that most likely means it is pregnant.&#8221; Han Sen reviewed the
      situation and asked himself a number of questions.
    </p>

    <p>
      The bamboo and the white bugs in the cave were eaten in droves by the
      hungry scorpion. Eventually, it looked to be full and wanted to leave, and
      so it started to return in Han Sen&#8217;s direction.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen quickly made his exit and evaded the scorpion&#8217;s sight. It
      wasn&#8217;t long before the scorpion itself re-emerged, and when it did,
      it went up the mountain.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen did not give the scorpion chase. If it really was pregnant, he
      knew it&#8217;d be a waste to kill it now. He much preferred the idea of
      waiting until it had given birth before slaying it and the baby.
    </p>

    <p>
      But Han Sen still had a strong interest in the bamboo he had observed down
      below, and the white bugs they seemed to contain. He waited until the
      scorpion was long gone and then, with a command for the silver fox to
      stand guard, ventured back inside. He didn&#8217;t want to risk having the
      scorpion return and corner him.
    </p>

    <p>
      There were many bamboo-looking plants in the cavern, and they were about
      thirty centimeters in diameter. Many of them had already been snapped in
      two by the scorpion, followings its visit, so there was a lot strewn
      across the ground. This included many of the white bugs the scorpion had
      missed.
    </p>

    <p>
      The white bugs were pale and semi-translucent, and you could see the blood
      vessels inside them.
    </p>

    <p>
      The bugs that were on the ground were wriggling around. They tried
      slithering back into the broken bamboo shoots, but they had some
      difficulty.
    </p>

    <p>They couldn&#8217;t enter the perfect bamboo.</p>

    <p>
      Han Sen picked up a broken shoot of bamboo and tried to crush it in his
      hands but could not. He had to amp up his strength and exhaust all the
      power he could to eventually do so.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;That&#8217;s some tough bamboo.&#8221; Han Sen threw the bamboo on
      the floor and then summoned his peacock crossbow. He loaded it with a
      z-steel bolt and fired it at one of the bugs that was trying to crawl its
      way into one of the broken bamboo ends.
    </p>

    <p>
      The z-steel bolt pierced through the white bug&#8217;s body, which made it
      squeal and release a white fog. The temperature began to drop, and the
      little area around the bug got all frosty. The bug then froze, as if it
      had just been taken out of the freezer.
    </p>

    <blockquote>

        Been Acquired. Consume Its Flesh To Obtain A Random Numeric Amount Of
        Mutant Geno Points, Ranging From Zero To Ten.&#8221;
      </p>
    </blockquote>

    <p>
      The voice rang in Han Sen&#8217;s head, which surprised Han Sen.
      &#8220;It&#8217;s a mutant creature, but how can a mutant creature release
      frosty air? This is strange. I thought only super creatures could wield
      elemental attacks.&#8221;
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen was curious, and so he summoned his Flaming Rex Spike to kill more
      of the silkworms on the ground. Over and over, the announcement continued
      to pop.
    </p>

    <p>
      When the Dark Silkworms were killed, they each let out a frosty air. The
      creatures were weak and unable to fight, so Han Sen was able to hack them
      up casually and without worry.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Mutant Creature Hunted: Dark Silkworm. The beast soul has been
      acquired. Consume its flesh to obtain a random numeric amount of mutant
      geno points, ranging from zero to ten.&#8221; After Han Sen hunted thirty
      silkworms, he finally heard the announcement that indicated ownership of a
      Dark Silkworm.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen then quickly looked up the beast soul&#8217;s info, keen to learn
      what type it was.
    </p>

    <div class="tables">
      <table class="beast">
        <tr>
          <th colspan="2">Beast Soul Gained</th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Mutant Dark Silkworm</td>
          <td>(One-Time Use Hidden Weapon)</td>
        </tr>
      </table>
      <!-- Mutant Dark Silkworm: One-Time Use Hidden Weapon -->
    </div>

    <p>
      Han Sen was pleasantly surprised, as it had been a long time since he had
      last seen a one-time use beast soul. It was rare to find hidden weapon
      beast souls, and he wondered which one that might have been.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen summoned the mutant Dark Silkworm, which sprouted a big, white,
      and fat bug on the palm of Han Sen&#8217;s hand. It was rather heavy.
    </p>

    <p>
      He looked at it for a while, unsure of what it did. After some thought, he
      threw it at the cavern wall.
    </p>

    <p>Pang!</p>

    <p>
      The fat bug hit the wall and exploded. It unleashed a heavy, white mist.
      The fog&#8217;s radius was about a meter, and the stone wall it had been
      thrown upon was caked in a layer of ice.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;This is interesting.&#8221; Han Sen was rather shocked while
      looking at it. It was just a mutant class beast soul, yet it could unleash
      a certain frosty power. This was not normal at all.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;I wonder if there are any sacred-blood class Dark Silkworms here?
      If I can get a sacred-blood class Dark Silkworm, it might come in
      handy.&#8221;
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen killed all the silkworms he could see but was mildly disappointed
      to learn that each one was a mutant class variant. No matter how many he
      killed, it didn&#8217;t seem as if sacred-blood types existed.
    </p>

    <p>
      There were sixty dead silkworms on the floor by now, and after a moment of
      thinking, he used the Flaming Rex Spike to strike the bamboo. He watched
      how many of the silkworms came flying out of the bamboo.
    </p>

    <p>
      After killing a hundred more of the wriggly silkworms, he managed to
      obtain another two mutant beast souls. But still, no sacred-blood types.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Never mind. Let me pack up the ones I&#8217;ve already killed and
      vacate the area. If I dry them up and grind them into powder, people who
      eat them will be able to increase their mutant geno points with ease.
      That&#8217;s not too bad.&#8221; Han Sen used a bag to collect the hundred
      frozen silkworm bodies and turned around to go outside and dry them.
    </p>

    <p>
      There were many silkworms in that subterranean forest, and there seemed to
      be at least ten of them in every single shoot of bamboo. If he wanted to
      harvest them all, he couldn&#8217;t imagine how long that might have
      taken.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen planned to temporarily give up killing the silkworms, wanting to
      wait until the scorpion came back, ate its fill, and gave birth. Once the
      scorpions had been dealt with, Han Sen had the idea of returning here to
      harvest and collect the rest of the silkworms, free from possible
      intrusion.
    </p>

    <p>
      After Han Sen picked up all the silkworms he had killed, Han Sen suddenly
      heard a noise come from deeper within the bamboo forest. It seemed that
      something was emerging from further within.
