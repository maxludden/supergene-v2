<p>“Sacred’s remnants, come out and die!” A godly voice echoed
throughout space. The ice walls of the ice bunker’s laboratory
exploded. The tools were breaking and falling apart.</p>
<p>Han Yufei’s eyes suddenly looked cold. She was holding a
scalpel. She ran out of the ice bunker’s laboratory and exited the
ice bunker. She pulled a metal orb out of her pocket and threw
it.</p>
<p>That metal orb fired out some light. The lights crossed each
other to become a bai sema. It protected the ice bunker from
further harm and filtered out the godly voice. The lab stopped
breaking.</p>
<p>Han Sen and Dragon Lady ran out of the ice bunker’s laboratory.
The space around them turned dark. It was like the whole cold plant
was disconnected from the world.</p>
<p>In the darkness, there was a black shadow floating in the air.
It coldly looked at them. The scary god sounds came out from that
shadow.</p>
<p>Because that shadow and darkness were combined, they were not
able to see what it looked like. They only saw a pair of red,
gleaming eyes. They were like two blood marks in the air.</p>
<p>Han Sen clearly felt that the two eyes were looking at him.
Besides, what the guy had said earlier was not hard to decipher.
This unknown being was coming after him.</p>
<p>“What is your name, and why have you come here?” Han Sen loudly
asked.</p>
<p>“Shadow God. I am here to scrub up the last remains of Sacred.”
The powerful god voice returned. The red eyes in space looked even
angrier.</p>
<p>“It’s the Annihilation class Shadow God that has descended. It
looks like the God Spirits are really afraid of Sacred Leader’s
blood. They could not wait to destroy all who possessed blue
blood.” Han Sen’s stern face did not change. He looked at Shadow
God and coldly asked, “To clear the remnants of Sacred, shouldn’t
you go after the guy who gave me blue blood instead? Are you not
going to kill the one who caused this? Did you really come for me,
who is a victim of the blue blood? It seems like God Spirits are
just wimps that only dare to bully the weak.”</p>
<p>“Hmph! As long as you are a remnant of Sacred, you should die,”
Shadow God said. His eyes were glowing with a red light. They
turned into two red beams that went straight for Han Sen. Han Sen
readied himself for a fight, but Han Yufei’s body moved first. She
was in front of Han Sen holding a controller. Han Yufei’s finger
touched the controller twice. Suddenly, a light screen came out
from the controller. The screen looked like a mirror.</p>
<p>Shadow God’s red light beam hit the screen and ricocheted back.
It made Shadow God have to fire another two red lights to
extinguish it.</p>
<p>“Shadow God, I don’t care about who you want to kill,” Han Yufei
coldly said. “If you dare to try and destroy my lab, you must pay
the ultimate price.”</p>
<p>“Han Yufei, this is none of your business. If you do not want to
be trapped for another billion years, you should leave now.” Shadow
God coldly grunted. “I want to know how you might attempt to trap
me for a billion years,” Han Yufei coldly said.</p>
<p>“If you have a death wish, I will grant it for you right now.”
Shadow God’s voice coldly boomed. He glowed with a red light. This
time, it did not manifest as a laser and leave him. It was like two
red suns were glowing weirdly in the dark of space.</p>
<p>Han Sen’s and Dragon Lady’s expressions changed. They had
already mustered all the power they could to defend the place, but
they felt as if they were losing control of their bodies. They were
like wooden dolls just standing where they were.</p>
<p>It was not just that either. Han Sen’s body suddenly lost all
control and moved. The ancient spirit seed was still on his arm,
but the arm moved. His hands moved to grab his own head. He tried
to twist it like he was attempting to twist his own head off.
Dragon Lady was the same. She held her own head. Her neck had
already been turned 90 degrees, and it was still twisting. The neck
bones started to creak and groan. It was like her head was going to
be ripped off at any moment. It made Dragon Lady’s mouth and nose
start to bleed. Han Sen was not doing well either. He felt as if
his neck was going to break soon. His jaw was almost touching his
back. His face was all puffed out. He was going to explode.</p>
<p>“I am ripping my own head off. That is a new way to die.” Han
Sen mocked himself. He knew that he and Dragon Lady were being
controlled by Shadow God’s power, but he just did not know what
sort of power it was. How could he lose control of his body without
knowing it?</p>
<p>Han Sen was trapped by the blue blood power, so he was unable to
fight back unless he used his Super God Spirit more or Blood-Pulse
Sutra to activate the blue blood power. Aside from that, there was
nothing he could do.</p>
<p>Pang!</p>
<p>While Han Sen wondered about which power he should use, he
suddenly saw Han Yufei’s hands control the controller to bounce
back a beam of light. That beam of light went three feet and
spread. It turned into a light umbrella.</p>
<p>Han Yufei pressed the button on the controller that had become
an umbrella. The light umbrella suddenly turned black. She placed
it over their heads and blocked Shadow God’s red light
influence.</p>
<p>Han Sen and Dragon Lady let out a long sigh. They had regained
control of their bodies.</p>
<p>Han Sen was still moving his neck, which was in pain, as he
asked. “What is that red light power?”</p>
<p>“The red light was just his help. His real power is that.” Han
Yufei pointed at the floor.</p>
<p>Han Sen looked and saw nothing on the floor. They were standing
atop the ice bunker. There was snow on it.</p>
<p>Han Sen suddenly understood. Han Yufei was talking about the
shadow. When the red light shone, Han Yufei’s black umbrella
created a black shadow. It covered Han Sen in its shadow.</p>
<p>“Do you think this can block my Shadow God power?” Shadow God
coldly asked. His eyes were glowing with red light. It made the
shadow around become clearer.</p>
<p>Han Sen quickly discovered that the umbrella in Han Yufei’s
hands was shaking. It looked as if it was going to get blown away
any second. Han Yufei slightly frowned. She wanted to do something,
but she heard a “ding-dong” sound come out from the dark of space.
It was like many bells were tolling. Han Sen and the others
immediately saw a purple light emerge from the dark of space. Ten
of those lights were like a real dragon pulling a copper carriage.
It was like the sky and earth had a line of light.</p>
<p>“This is… Purple Fight’s bronze carriage.” Han Sen looked at it.
He noticed where the car was from. He had been inside Purple
Fight’s eye once upon a time, sitting inside that bronze car.</p>
<p>The cloud dragons were pulling the car to a point above the ice
bunker laboratory. The entire ice bunker laboratory was covered by
the shadows of the car and cloud dragons.</p>
<p>There was a sudden “tzi-ah” noise. The bronze car’s car door
opened. Purple Fight walked out. He looked at Shadow God, who was
in the dark.</p>
