<p>Han Sen was sleeping on his bed with Little Silver lying next to
him. Little Silver suddenly got up, and silver lightning sparked to
life across his body. It grew in volume, illuminating the room in
chaotic flashes. His silver eyes stared toward the door.</p>
<p>Han Sen woke up, and across the room, Little Star was shaking
off sleep as well.</p>
<p>Han Yan and the other girls were sleeping in the next room down
the hall.</p>
<p>When Han Sen scanned the hall with the Dongxuan Aura, his face
hardened. Before he could react, there was a knock on the door.</p>
<p>“Han Sen, Knight King wishes to see you,” said the knight
delivering the message, his voice coming from just outside the
door.</p>
<p>Ordinarily, Han Sen wouldn’t mind the intrusion, and he would
politely open the door. But this time was different. Little Silver
was very smart, and he could always discern who was a friend and
who was a foe. If he was showing hostility to an Ice Blue Knight in
the base, then he must have had a reason. He was gathering up power
as if he was prepping for a fight.</p>
<p>Han Sen used his Dongxuan Aura to scan outside the room, and a
lump formed in his throat. It felt as if a mountain-sized stone had
dropped into his heart.</p>
<p>“Ice Blue Knight King is outside,” Han Sen thought. Although he
couldn’t see or feel the presence of Ice Blue Knight King, Han
Sen’s senses were telling him that the man was looming out there
like a mountain.</p>
<p>Although Han Sen didn’t know why Ice Blue Knight King had come
personally, he knew it was for nothing good. Plus, the knight who
knocked on the door had said that the Knight King wished to see Han
Sen. He made no mention of him already being there.</p>
<p>Now, Ice Blue Knight King was standing outside the room and
masking his presence. In addition to being abnormal, it was simply
impolite.</p>
<p>“Okay, wait a second. I’ll be right there,” Han Sen called back,
pretending to get dressed.</p>
<p>Han Sen used his Dongxuan Aura to peer outside the room again.
There, he found other Ice Blue Knights knocking on the door of the
girls’ room. Han Sen’s nerves were starting to make him ill.</p>
<p>Thinking fast, Han Sen picked up Little Silvernand set him down
on Little Star’s back. Little Star knew what Han Sen wanted, and so
he immediately activated his Starsea Travel and took them through
the wall to the next room.</p>
<p>Han Yan and the others jumped slightly as Little Star came
through the wall with Han Sen and Little Silver. They looked
surprised, but they quickly realized what was going on.</p>
<p>Han Sen didn’t have time to explain, so he summoned Destiny’s
Tower and quietly said, “Get in.”</p>
<p>Zero and Han Meng’er leaped inside without a word. Ji Qing
started to ask something, but before she could, Han Yan pulled her
inside.</p>
<p>Huangfu Jing was very fast, and she jumped in without a moment’s
hesitation.</p>
<p>Han Sen tossed Little Silver and Little Star in as well. Only
Bao’er remained on Han Sen’s shoulder. Little Angel was standing
very still, peering at the door.</p>
<p>“Get in!” Han Sen hissed under his breath. He wasn’t sure what
was wrong with Little Angel. She had never disobeyed a command
before.</p>
<p>Little Angel didn’t enter Destiny’s Tower. Instead, she just
approached Han Sen and spread her wings. The angelic halo glowed to
life over her head.</p>
<p>Her youthful body suddenly transformed into a busty angel with
blonde, waving hair. A crystal feather sword appeared in her
hand.</p>
<p>Little Angel had triggered her angel mode. She had sensed
danger.</p>
<p>“I can deal with this! You just need to get inside.” Han Sen
sensed that Ice Blue Knight King was right outside the door. He
knew Han Sen had moved to the other room.</p>
<p>Before Han Sen could say anything more, Little Angel flapped her
angel wings, flew in front of Han Sen, and spread her angelic wings
wider. Her clear eyes peered right into Han Sen, and then, her red
lips came down toward his own. She kissed him firmly.</p>
<p>Han Sen felt a raw surge of power enter him through his mouth.
Little Angel’s entire body was glowing with holy light, and that
holy light rushed right into Han Sen.</p>
<p>Boom!</p>
<p>Angel wings spread from Han Sen’s back as a halo appeared over
his head. His entire body shone with white light, and a feathery,
angelic sword slid into his hand.</p>
<p>Pure angelic power was combining with Han Sen’s own strength.
Han Sen felt his power rise by an insane amount.</p>
<p>Han Sen was surprised by this. Little Angel hadn’t demonstrated
this power since she stopped being a mere beast soul. Since she now
had a genuine body, he hadn’t thought that she could still combine
herself with him.</p>
<p>Han Sen and Little Angel were both Marquises, but Little Angel’s
power was so clear. It was almost as strong as Han Sen’s.</p>
<p>The two Marquise powers mingled together, and Han Sen’s power
shot past the power ceiling of a Marquise. His entire body felt
incredible.</p>
<p>Han Sen knew Little Angel had combined herself with him because
she had sensed imminent and extreme danger. If it wasn’t for that,
she wouldn’t have taken such drastic action.</p>
<p>The moment Han Sen put Destiny’s Tower back in the Sea of Soul,
the room door was forced open. Han Sen saw Ice Blue Knight King
enter; he didn’t use any power, but Han Sen felt waves of pressure
rolling off of him.</p>
<p>This was the power of a half-deified being. He was no weaker
than Yisha.</p>
<p>“Bao’er!” Han Sen didn’t hesitate. He summoned the dragon wings
for his back and his ears, then employed his stone cow body. His
skin looked red, and both draconic and angelic wings spread behind
him.</p>
<p>Pang!</p>
<p>Bao’er’s hand slapped the surface of the Blood Scorpion Jade
Drum. A shockwave rolled out of the drum, and Han Sen flapped his
three pairs of wings. He teleported to the back wall.</p>
<p>Ice Blue Knight King frowned. He used a blue halo to shield
himself. The shockwave was like a scorpion’s tail, striking and
stinging the Knight King’s head. But the blue halo swirled around
him, and the sting couldn’t land and puncture him properly.</p>
<p>“Han Sen, I will ask you this clearly: are you about to desert
this army?” Ice Blue Knight King stared at Han Sen, his eyes having
followed Han Sen’s teleportation instantly. As he spoke, an
unnerving power came out from him.</p>
<p>Han Sen teleported into a hallway, and the Knight King’s power
landed on him immediately. It felt like a mountain had slammed into
him, and it almost made him collapse on the ground.</p>
<p>“If you were willing to let me explain, you wouldn’t have come
here like this,” Han Sen said flatly. Then, he exploded with power
to fight off Ice Blue Knight King’s own. He teleported away and
broke through the roof of the base as he did. Now, he was in the
air.</p>
<p>Han Sen didn’t know if he could escape, but going back to the
sanctuary wasn’t an option this time. Han Yan and the others were
in Destiny’s Tower. With their level of strength, they would be
damaged by the restrictions of the sanctuary. Not even Destiny’s
Tower could shield them from that.</p>
<p>If he took them back to the sanctuary, they’d either
self-destruct or be thrown out of the sanctuary. Both options would
lead to death.</p>
<p>Han Sen gritted his teeth. Before he teleported again, Ice Blue
Knight King rose into the air as well. The King looked down at Han
Sen from above. That pressure he exuded was hard to explain, but it
made Han Sen feel as if the man was a god. It didn’t matter where
Han Sen chose to flee; he couldn’t escape from this terrifying
being.</p>
