<p>On a ship that was headed to the Andromeda system, a
crystallizer woman turned to a man next to her. She looked
afraid.</p>
<p>“Are you a crystallizer?” she asked.</p>
<p>“Yes,” the man said with a nod. He sounded rather cold.</p>
<p>The woman looked very surprised, and she said, “I can’t believe
I have met someone of the same race here. My name is Lydia. You
took the hall’s quest to venture to the Andromeda system to hunt
xenogeneics, didn’t you?”</p>
<p>“Yes,” the man answered. His emotions didn’t seem perturbed at
all.</p>
<p>“That is great. Can we combine forces and do it together?” the
woman said.</p>
<p>“No, we cannot,” the man answered.</p>
<p>The woman seemed disappointed, and she said, “That’s fine, I
guess. What is your name, anyway? Can we exchange phone numbers?
There are too few crystallizers here. We can contact each
other.”</p>
<p>“No, we cannot,” the man said. His face remained impassive.</p>
<p>The woman had spoken nicely to the man, but the man hadn’t
reciprocated by the smallest amount. He never gave her a reply that
was greater than three words.</p>
<p>After they arrived in the Andromeda system, the ship’s
passengers spread out as they headed to the various planets. The
man got off the ship while the woman followed after him.</p>
<p>“Why are you following me?” the man asked, turning around and
looking at Lydia strangely.</p>
<p>“It is because, in this universe, a crystallizer woman meeting a
crystallizer man is a one-in-a-billion chance. I don’t want to miss
out on such a rare opportunity. So, please, tell me your name,”
Lydia responded, lowering her head and mumbling quickly. She spoke
in a volume that only dogs could have discerned.</p>
<p>“Yi Dong Mu,” the man finally spoke his name.</p>
<p>Lydia looked very happy to hear that. She raised her head,
wanting to tell Yi Dong Mu something. But as she opened her lips,
before she could speak, Yi Dong Mu’s dagger slammed through her
heart.</p>
<p>“Why… why…” Lydia couldn’t believe what had just happened. She
stared at Yi Dong Mu with shock. She couldn’t believe the man would
do something like this to her.</p>
<p>“It is because I sense something dangerous within you.” Yi Dong
Mu pulled his dagger back out of Lydia, sending the woman stumbling
to the ground.</p>
<p>He looked at Lydia’s body, then turned around. He left and
disappeared someplace into the mountains.</p>
<p>Shortly after Yi Dong Mu left, the lifeless Lydia opened her
eyes. Weird flashes passed through her eyes, and she stood up like
a wooden doll.</p>
<p>At that moment, Lydia looked like a lifeless robot. Her eyes
were wide open, but they had no focus. It was like lots of data was
scrolling through her eyes.</p>
<p>“It failed again. Such a heartless killer. He killed a beautiful
woman of the same race simply because he sensed danger. It is so
hard to deal with this guy.” After a while, Lydia spoke to herself.
“So annoying! I have now failed eight times trying to get close to
this target. Another team failed to gain any information from him,
as well. It is so hard to get information from others who have been
in contact with Han Sen before. Since when did the crystallizers
become so strong? It looks like this investigation will become
quite difficult.”</p>
<p>After that, Lydia’s body suddenly collapsed on the ground. Her
light faded, and she looked like a dead body again.</p>
<p>“Brother King, has anything special happened to you recently?”
Wang Yuhang looked at his phone while chatting with Xie Qing
King.</p>
<p>“I made some new friends,” Xie Qing King said, with a cigar
hanging from his lips. He was reclined in a CEO chair. He looked
really relaxed as he spoke.</p>
<p>“Me, too. But it looks like something happened with Han Sen. Is
he in big trouble or something?” Wang Yuhang said.</p>
<p>“Maybe not. Maybe they are just keen on investigating the boy.
Otherwise, the people coming to ask us questions wouldn’t be so
gentle.” Xie Qing King squinted while he spoke.</p>
<p>“Then, what are we going to do?” Wang Yuhang asked.</p>
<p>“If someone is giving you free money and beautiful women, are
you ever going to say no? It would be very rude, and you would be
missing out. That would sadden the person making the offer. Of
course, we aren’t going to do that.” Xie Qing King laughed.</p>
<p>“Teehee! That is what I thought, too. Lin Feng, Tang Zhenliu,
and the others, as well. Can you please get in touch with them? Me
being here is not a coincidence.” Wang Yuhang laughed.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>Every day, Han Sen remained near the lake and continued fishing
out pages of the Xuan Yellow Sutra. For some reason, whenever it
was Bao’er’s turn, she always ended up with actual treasures, and
every time Han Sen fished, he ended up with a sheet of paper
belonging to the Xuan Yellow Sutra.</p>
<p>“This is so f*cking weird. Why can I only retrieve this geno
art, page by page?” Han Sen wondered. He couldn’t think of an
answer.</p>
<p>After all, anti-material worlds were difficult to explain.
Common sense and logic didn’t really apply to such places, and Han
Sen didn’t want to waste time mulling it over. He just wanted to
gather all the pages of the Xuan Yellow Sutra as fast as he could.
He was keen to find out what sort of geno art it was.</p>
<p>“A geno art that comes from the anti-material world. No matter
how bad it is, it must be special, right?” Han Sen thought to
himself.</p>
<p>Suddenly, the triangle symbol on the small jade figure glowed.
Han Sen knew Exquisite was on her way over. He carefully synced his
thoughts with the small jade figure.</p>
<p>“Find anything?”</p>
<p>Moments later, Exquisite teleported right next to Han Sen.</p>
<p>“Yes, but I did not get any fish. The stuff I’ve been collecting
is pretty weird,” Han Sen with a strange tone of voice.</p>
<p>“Underworld Lake is connected with the anti-material world. It
is normal to fish up odd things. What did you get?” Exquisite
asked.</p>
<p>“I got some paper,” Han Sen said slowly. Liyu Zhen had seen
these yellow sheets of paper before, so there was no use in hiding
it. He had no choice but to reveal what he had found.</p>
<p>“Paper? What sort of paper?” Exquisite asked with curiosity.
Although anything could show up in Underworld Lake, it was rare to
get something like paper.</p>
<p>“About that…” Han Sen was frozen. When he thought about the lewd
content on the yellow pages, he didn’t know what to say.</p>
<p>Exquisite could sense what Han Sen was thinking. So, she blushed
and said, “Never mind. You don’t have to tell me. Whatever you get
from Underworld Lake belongs to you. Even if you collect a deified
treasure, it is all yours. When you leave Outer Sky, you can even
take them with you.”</p>
<p>“Thanks.” Han Sen pretended to be relieved.</p>
<p>“I thought you always wanted xenogeneic resources. I have found
some for you already. How much you get will depend on your power,
though,” Exquisite said to Han Sen. She appeared rather mellow.</p>
<p>“What do you mean?” Han Sen asked, curious.</p>
<p>“Outer Sky has a star tree. The tree produces star fruit, and it
is surrounded by powerful space xenogeneics. They are King class,
at least. Of course, some can even reach deified. Now, you can
collect the star fruit, but how many you can collect will depend on
you.”</p>
