<h2>Fulfill Your Wishes</h2>
<h3>Chapter 2978</h3>

<p>Han Sen thought, “Is an Annihilation class God Spirit’s
authority just wealth? Those gods used to say they could do
anything and fulfill any wish they wanted to. That is such a big
scam. According to the God Spirit rules, God Spirits could not give
fake information. If they lied, they would not be able to finalize
a trade. They would not receive the life spans they sought. To
compose a trade, God Spirits would use everything they could. I
really don’t understand why they seem to be so keen on seeking out
years.”</p>
<p>Sky God Crown’s message had not included that. Therefore, Han
Sen was unable to find out.</p>
<p>That aside, God Spirits had the authority to leave the god
temples. They were not able to leave the god temples for long.
During that period, the god temple was sealed up so they could not
be challenged.</p>
<p>Unless the God Spirits possessed a creature of the universe,
they would not be able to leave for a very long time. If they did
do that, they would not receive protection from the god temples
anymore. If they died, they died. Unless the god personality was
taken back to the god temple, they could no longer be respawned.
There was still one very important thing. God Spirits were allowed
to challenge God Spirits that were a higher level than them, but
that was pointless for Han Sen because he was not a real God
Spirit. He could not level up his position any higher.</p>
<p>Even if he could challenge them, Han Sen was already
Annihilation level. He could only challenge God Spirits that were
at a higher level than him. Han Sen could not fight an enemy that
was the same Annihilation class as he was. To challenge a Reboot
class God Spirit was a death wish. Han Sen would never have tried
being so bold.</p>
<p>Han Sen looked at God and wished to say something, but God
winked at him. He looked at the door of the god temple and said,
“You have business to attend to.” “What do you mean?” Han Sen
looked at the god temple’s door. He did not see anything. He turned
around and looked at God, but he was gone.</p>
<p>While Han Sen was wondering what was going on, he saw someone
fly into the god plaza area. They were flying toward his god
temple.</p>
<p>Han Sen wondered, “It cannot be this much of a coincidence. I
have only just become a God Spirit, and a creature in the universe
already wants to challenge me.”</p>
<p>According to what Han Sen had been inspecting, the universe
creatures only dared challenging Destruction class God Spirits. No
one dared to challenge Disaster class. Why would a creature go and
challenge him, who was Annihilation class?</p>
<p>That body was coming straight for Han Sen’s god temple. It soon
entered the radius of the god temple.</p>
<p>The god palace and god temples were situated in a realm that was
between reality and space. No matter where one was in the universe,
if one’s mind was in god’s palace, one could go there. A creature
that was able to fly in the universe could just use an airship to
go to a god palace. It did not matter how far or near one was.</p>
<p>Han Sen stared at the body. He was shocked. It was someone he
knew.</p>
<p>“Why is Fox Queen coming here for?” Han Sen thought.</p>
<p>Fox Queen was the wife of Ghost Bone General. As far as Han Sen
knew, her power was not very strong when compared to most deifieds.
She was not able to fight a destruction class God Spirit. How could
she hope to tackle an Annihilation class God Spirit?</p>
<p>While Han Sen was making guesses, Fox Queen was already in the
plaza of the god temple.</p>
<p>By the rules of the God Spirits, Han Sen had no choice but to
fight. Otherwise, Fox Queen was able to replace his God Spirit
flag. As long as the Sky God Crown was not broken, he would not
die.</p>
<p>Fox Queen came before the god temple and kneeled as if she was
praying to a god. “Mister God of Wealth, I want to make a wish to
you. Please help me.”</p>
<p>“It looks like she is not here to challenge a God Spirit.” Han
Sen was shocked. He said, “If you have come a for a wish, then come
in and</p>
<p>speak.”</p>
<p>“Thank you, Mister.” Fox Queen entered god temple.</p>
<p>Han Sen’s heart jumped. The god temple’s gate closed down,
leaving only him and Fox Queen, the two of them, inside.</p>
<p>“Tell me about your wish. I will fulfill your wish.” Han Sen
stood upon the god altar. He looked at Fox Queen with a very
serious look as he spoke.</p>
<p>Fox Queen was the wife of Ghost Bone General. She must have
known all about God Spirits. There was an 80% to 90% chance that
she knew there was a consequence for the formation of wishes. Han
Sen wondered why she had still come there to make a wish.</p>
<p>Fox Queen kneeled again. Her fox eyes stared at Han Sen. She
spoke very softly. “I only have one wish. Please help me get back
my Fox race’s race weapon Nine Spin Destiny Mirror. If that can be
done, I am willing to do anything.” Because the Sky God Crown had a
light above, it made Han Sen look like a god enveloped in rainbow
god light. Only his body was visible. One was not able to see his
face. Fox Queen was not able to tell that he was Han Sen. That fact
made Han Sen feel strange.</p>
<p>After Fox Queen made a wish, Sky God Crown sent a message to Han
Sen. It said that if he was able to fulfill Fox Queen’s wish, he
would earn a life span of 300.</p>
<p>The Sky God Crown showed that if Han Sen finished the wish, he
could at least get 300 life spans. It was not just 300 life spans.
He actually was able to get more than that.</p>
<p>It was like if Han Sen picked up the Nine Spin Destiny Mirror
and gave it to her, he would only get the lowest amount of life
spans available. If he went and stole it from some scary elite and
returned the Nine Spin Destiny Mirror to her, she would pay with a
lot more of her years. Aside from that, she would also get karma.
She would have to pay the price.</p>
<p>Han Sen’s God Spirit power was just wealth. Fox Queen’s wish was
not in his power to fulfill. Han Sen had to find a way to finish
Fox Queen’s wish. If he was unable to finish it, his life span
would be damaged.</p>
<p>Accepting a wish was a double-edged sword. If God Spirits
accepted the wish, they had to find a way to finish it. If they
could not complete it, they would have to scam the wisher to get
and keep the life span. God spirits employed every dirty trick in
the book.</p>
<p>Fox Queen’s wish was something Han Sen wanted to complete. That
was because he had the Nine Spin Destiny Mirror. Han Sen still
hesitated. He did not know if the Nine Spin Destiny Mirror was
worth the 300 years.</p>
<p>To universal creatures, life span was very important. Han Sen
was not a real God Spirit. He was not immortal.</p>
<p>Now, Han Sen had a life span of 2,000. That seemed like a very
long time. To many creatures of the universe, it was nothing.</p>
<p>Fox Queen was nervous. She had taken a big risk coming to make a
wish. There was nothing else she could do. She had to do this.</p>
<p>Going to the god temple to make a wish was a dangerous prospect.
If the god did not want her to make a wish, they could simply kill
her. She would have been killed.</p>
<p>Fortunately, Han Sen had allowed her to enter the god temple and
speak her wish. Her life was safe, but it was unknown whether or
not Han Sen could fulfill the wish or how he would even go about
trying. It was certain that it would affect her a lot.</p>
<p>If a God Spirit finished her very difficult wish, she would have
to pay with a lot of her life span. She was afraid that her life
span might get all spent.</p>
<p>Han Sen looked at Fox Queen and coldly said, “I can fulfill your
wish, but I have a condition.”</p>
