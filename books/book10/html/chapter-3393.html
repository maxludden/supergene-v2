<h2>Fighting Ancient Devil</h2>
<h3>Chapter 3393</h3>

<p>It was an imperial jade seal. It was white at the bottom and red
on the top. Its four corners were like white jade.</p>
<p>The beast on top was red. It crouched on the seal. It was like a
monkey with a sharp mouth. It had wings on its back. It looked very
beautiful.</p>
<p>Ancient Devil put the imperial jade seal in his hands. The
location of his fingers was on the spine of the blood beast. The
stamp was facing down, so Han Sen could not see the print that was
left behind.</p>
<p>Time was still in motion. For Ancient Devil to have been able to
follow him for so long without detection meant he had likely done
something special to achieve that.</p>
<p>He was getting close to the sky clock while holding the imperial
jade seal. He must have set this up. He must have had a way to
conquer the sky clock.</p>
<p>Han Sen did not know of a way in which he could guarantee
ownership of the sky clock. His heart jumped. He suddenly let the
crystal needle go and retreated two steps back. He left the crystal
needle’s spinning area.</p>
<p>The crystal needle still tried its best to move. When Han Sen
let go, the needle spun like mad. In no time at all, its spin had
conducted many full cycles.</p>
<p>Han Sen’s body could withstand the power. In the silent time
stream reversal, it was like Han Sen’s body did not move. He was
like a mountain. He stared at Ancient Devil.</p>
<p>Ancient Devil was still around 2,100 feet away from the sky
clock. He was in the reverse time stream too. The reverse time
stream hit him. As Ancient Devil’s hands clutched the imperial jade
seal, some strange noises were produced.</p>
<p>The blood beast atop the seal was glowing with a red light. The
blood beast spread its wings as if it was alive. It made some weird
noises. Its eyes were red.</p>
<p>Han Sen noticed Ancient Devil was in a time-reversal area, but
his body was not devolving. It had to be because of the blood beast
atop the imperial jade seal. It was weirdly changing and looked as
if it was getting younger.</p>
<p>“What is that imperial jade seal? Can it help Ancient Devil
accept the reversal of time?” Han Sen frowned and looked at the
imperial jade seal. He was shocked.</p>
<p>Ancient Devil was holding the imperial jade seal. His body was
in the red light. When time went by, he kept stepping toward the
sky clock. He kept walking whilst saying, “This item is called the
Chaos God Imperial Jade Seal. It is a relic belonging to the God
Chaos Party. It represents the authority of the God Chaos Party. It
can suppress a sky full of everything. It can endure the
time-reversal power in my stead.”</p>
<p>“It looks like you have found a way to earn the sky clock.” Han
Sen looked at Ancient Devil, who was stepping across the big
crystal clock. He walked in front of him.</p>
<p>“I really do not want to become your enemy, but the sky clock is
very important to me. I must claim it.” Ancient Devil stopped in
front of Han Sen and sighed.</p>
<p>“I must get the sky clock. Let’s see which one of us holds what
it takes. That being said, we have never properly fought together.
At least today, for this one time, we will be engaging in combat
with one another.” Han Sen walked to Ancient Devil. He looked very
serious.</p>
<p>Some people, regardless of if they were weak or strong, were not
to be underestimated. Ancient Devil was one such person.</p>
<p>“It looks like this really has to be it.” Ancient Devil held the
Chaos God Imperial Jade Seal, but he did not reveal any power. It
looked as if he was a normal human.</p>
<p>“It looks like your power has recovered by quite a bit.” Han Sen
stopped 15 feet away from Ancient Devil. The two of them were atop
the crystal clock. He let the time keep releasing its reversal
powers on them.</p>
<p>“It will be better than before,” Ancient Devil coldly said.</p>
<p>“Very good. I wanted to see your powers, so let’s go.” Han Sen
raised his left hand and used his left hand like a knife.</p>
<p>Han Sen was unable to feel weak powers, but his will was still
there. When he raised his hand, he made other people feel as if the
sky and the ground existed between his fingers. If Han Sen moved
his left hand, it was as if the sky and the ground would snap in
two.</p>
<p>Ancient Devil did not move. He raised his fist. His fist looked
ordinary, but it also looked like a mountain. It felt very stable
and indestructible.</p>
<p>Han Sen did not fall back. Instead, he pushed forward. He used
his hand like a knife. He slashed toward Ancient Devil. He did not
look at Ancient Devil’s fist. He used his life to bet on his life.
He was keen to see which of the pair would win this gambit.</p>
<p>If this was between ordinary people, the fought would have
already started. Han Sen would have had to fight for his life if he
sought to survive.</p>
<p>If he did not fight, he would have to fall back. Then, he would
lose the power and be in passive mode.</p>
<p>Ancient Devil did not fall back. He did not fight Han Sen
either. The fist that looked like a mountain changed. He suddenly
became a mountain with lots of water flowing around. He went from
being extremely strong Yang to extremely soft Yin. Even so, it
still looked very natural. It was like the punch was supposed to be
that way.</p>
<p>Like when pulling out a knife to cut water, the water flowed
more. Han Sen slashed down. Ancient Devil’s body was like a water
flow that flashed. His fist was like water as it silently punched
Han Sen’s chest.</p>
<p>Han Sen’s body slashed down and forward. It seemed as if he
could not dodge that punch, but his body twisted. It blocked
Ancient Devil’s fist and made his body spin. His hand slashed
Ancient Devil’s head.</p>
<p>Han Sen had seen many elites, but he had never encountered
someone remotely comparable to the likes of Ancient Devil.</p>
<p>Han Sen used to meet strong elites all the time, such as Six
Paths Emperor or Lone Bamboo. Everyone had their own manner of
style and technique. If people did not look at them and only
observed their skills, they were sure to recognize who they
were.</p>
<p>Ancient Devil was different. He was like a different person
altogether. He was now like a combination of many different
things.</p>
<p>When he was strong, he was very overbearing. When he was soft,
he was unpredictable. He never regretted his punch. He was so soft
that he could spin a hundred times without reprieve.</p>
<p>No matter what skill it was, when used by Ancient Devil, it was
like he was adopting entire personas. He would become a completely
different person. Every example of his skill was the best it could
be.</p>
<p>Han Sen felt really weird doing battle with Ancient Devil. It
gave Han Sen the feeling that there was something wrong. It was
like he was doing battle with someone completely different every
time Ancient Devi switched technique.</p>
<p>Ancient Devil was very good when it came to doing the right
thing at the right time, but he was different from ordinary people.
He did everything perfectly without a single flaw.</p>
<p>He was like a sports player that could do everything. It did not
matter which subject or sport he was competing in, he would earn
the gold medal and perform difficult moves onlookers could never
expect to see.</p>
<p>Han Sen was the kind of person that maxed out every technique,
but every one of his skills had its own style. No matter what skill
he had, it was branded in his hand. It was his style. He was not
like Ancient Devil, who could keep changing.</p>
