    <p>
      On the other side of the royal shelter was a large mountain. Past the far
      side of this mountain, however, there wasn&#8217;t much snow. There was
      another royal shelter there, controlled by another faction whose owner had
      unlocked their first gene lock. Developing a shelter on the other side was
      a difficult thing.
    </p>

    <p>
      The big mountain in between was called &#8220;Devil&#8217;s
      Mountain,&#8221; and it was occupied by a number of powerful creatures.
      The slopes of the mountain were coarse, rugged, and steep, which put any
      would-be fighters on that terrain at a big disadvantage. Only a few people
      possessed what it took to hunt there, but even those never ventured too
      far.
    </p>

    <p>
      When Thunderdevil travelled across Devil&#8217;s Mountain, even he took
      the long route to avoid the more dangerous zones of that place.
    </p>

    <p>
      According to what Qi Xiuwen said, the owner of the royal shelter near the
      Devil&#8217;s Mountain, called Lu Hui, was the captain of the Blueblood
      Reserve Force. He was a powerful man, and although he had unlocked his
      first gene lock, there was a significant gulf in power between him and
      Thunderdevil.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen didn&#8217;t have as many people as he would have liked; the
      workforce he had was barely enough to keep the royal shelter in operation.
      His lack of troops was what had driven him to cooperate with others to
      take the royal shelter.
    </p>

    <p>
      Now that he had taken the ice fields, with the Devil&#8217;s Mountain at
      his back for protection, he was near-enough a king of the ice fields. If
      he was able to maintain his hold on the ice fields, and stay in his
      current position, he would earn a lot of money.

    </div>

    <p>
      Han Sen had benefited greatly from his assault on the royal shelter, and
      now his mutant geno amount had maxed out. His sacred geno points had also
      been given a boost, too. His sacred geno count had reached 39.
    </p>

    <p>
      Right now, if he had to gauge his fitness level based on the geno points
      he possessed, he&#8217;d put it at 150. But that was not because of his
      training.
    </p>

    <p>
      This number was equal to top-level evolvers. If Han Sen reached surpasser
      state, he could ascend to become a Celestial Being with a fitness level of
      three hundred.
    </p>

    <p>
      But Ji Yanran told him that before he became a surpasser, the higher
      fitness level he had, the better. There was no need to rush the process.
    </p>

    <p>
      For now, Han Sen&#8217;s primary goal was to unlock his gene lock. If he
      didn&#8217;t, it would not matter if his fitness was higher than evolvers
      who had already unlocked theirs. He would still be handicapped and his
      ability to perform skills would be significantly lessened.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;I have not been able to finish the first tier of Dongxuan Sutra in
      a reasonable amount of time, so perhaps it would be best if I do give
      Jadeskin another shot. I hope there won&#8217;t be any issues with
      it.&#8221; Han Sen, with a renewed resolve, decided to try out Jadeskin
      once more.
    </p>

    <p>
      When he unlocked the first tier of Jadeskin, he should have unlocked his
      gene lock, as well. But this had not come to pass.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen knew that the variant of Jadeskin he had learnt had some issues,
      but ever since he absorbed the ice powers from Xue Yikuang, the skill had
      changed somewhat. Perhaps through further practice with the skill,
      he&#8217;d be able to unlock his gene lock this time.
    </p>

    <p>
      What concerned Han Sen the most, however, was the possibility of his
      Jadeskin bringing him negative side effects. The last thing he wanted was
      to end up with the heart of someone from the Xue family.
    </p>

    <p>
      If he wanted to kill super creatures, which he did, doing so would be
      impossible for him if he did not unlock his gene lock. Han Sen had the
      Dongxuan Sutra, though, which meant he wasn&#8217;t too afraid to
      experiment with Jadeskin once more. Returning to the Alliance, Han Sen
      entered a training room and began to practice.
    </p>

    <p>
      With Jadeskin running again, cool air emanated from his cells. With ice
      coursing through his veins, his body felt as if it were being purified.
    </p>

    <p>
      A greater sense of clarity overwhelmed Han Sen&#8217;s mind, and he
      perceived the entire world in a different way. He couldn&#8217;t put
      finger on the exact nature of the change, though.
    </p>

    <p>
      Human emotions were dictated by greed, jealousy, lust, and desire. Under
      the effects of Jadeskin, things were different. Han Sen&#8217;s
      association with these cornerstones of human emotion seemed be dying
      somewhat; his emotions were getting colder.
    </p>

    <p>It made Han Sen feel keen, unusually keen.</p>

    <p>
      His vision, smell, taste, touch and hearing were increased as well, but it
      was the substantial amplification of his sixth sense that surprised him.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen could now hear voices coming from another training room, which was
      something he had been unable to do before.
    </p>

    <p>
      Although he wasn&#8217;t cold, Han Sen&#8217;s body felt somehow chill.
      His mind was at greater ease. His emotions seemed to be fading away, and
      he almost didn&#8217;t feel human.
    </p>

    <p>
      The cells in his body were struggling, almost moaning. It was as if they
      were now in shackles. Han Sen never felt so&#8230; restrained before. And
      as these feelings started to increase, his body started to panic, and he
      wanted to shatter the chains that bound him.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen felt himself touch the first gene lock, and he acknowledged that
      the Jadeskin was different than before. No matter how hard he had trained
      it in the past, it had never come close to making him feel as he did now.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen believed that if he continued, he would unlock the first gene
      lock. But the further he went, the more his emotions were stripped away
      from him. He was afraid of becoming little more than an android,
      programmed to gain power through any means necessary – all without a
      heart.
    </p>

    <p>
      He was afraid that if he unlocked his gene lock, he would lose all
      semblance of his former self. He would be a husk of a human being, someone
      worse than the Xue family, even.
    </p>

    <p>
      At least the Xue family possessed some form of emotion. Right now, Han Sen
      couldn&#8217;t feel anything. He didn&#8217;t feel happy, sad, or even
      angry. If he used the Jadeskin to unlock the gene lock, he ran the
      possibility of never feeling such emotions again.
    </p>

    <p>
      His cells were struggling, and his sixth sense continued to grow. He felt
      his body shrink, as if he was going to be imprisoned for a thousand years.
      He couldn&#8217;t wait to break free from whatever haunting force choked
      the liberty from his being.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;The last time I tried training Jadeskin, the Dongxuan Sutra is what
      woke me up. But right now, it isn&#8217;t doing anything. Maybe it&#8217;s
      because this time there is no danger? Perhaps I should push further and
      give this a genuine try.&#8221; Under the effects of his seemingly inhuman
      sense of apathy, Han Sen started to strike against his first gene lock.
    </p>

    <p>
      All the cells in his being began raging, burning hot with a sense of power
      he hadn&#8217;t felt before. It was like pushing against an invisible
      force with immeasurable strength, and as it occurred, Han Sen&#8217;s
      teeth chattered and his body trembled.
    </p>

    <p>
      But despite the writhing of his cells, his mind was calm and cool like a
      marble statue. And that&#8217;s how he sat there, unmoving.
    </p>

    <p>
      His sixth sense was getting even sharper now, and its continued to grow
      larger and larger. At the same time, Han Sen&#8217;s mind conjured up a
      strange image. Through the wall, he could see the people in the next
      training room.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen knew this wasn&#8217;t because he had been gifted x-ray vision,
      but through the accelerating growth of his seventh sense. Just by hearing
      the sounds, his mind&#8217;s eye could construct an image depicting
      exactly what was going on in the next chamber.
    </p>

    <p>
      That was the nature of the seventh sense. It was a person&#8217;s ability
      to analyze time and space, in their past, present, and future forms. Han
      Sen&#8217;s seventh sense was stronger than most people&#8217;s, and right
      now it had been amplified by an order of magnitude. It was sharper than
      the sharpest blade.
    </p>

    <p>
      Suddenly, the sound of broken ground sent a shockwave through Han
      Sen&#8217;s body. He felt something within him break. And now, he was
      overwhelmed with a feeling of release. It was as if he had been
      incarcerated for a thousand years and now, now he was free. He was feeling
      incandescent, as if he could command the skies, as if he could fly, as if
      he had been reborn as an angel.
