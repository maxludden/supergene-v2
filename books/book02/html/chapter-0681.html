    <p>
      After using Jadeskin to unlock his gene lock, Han Sen had achieved super
      senses. For the bone elephant in particular, it allowed him to see through
      its head. He could faintly watch and trace the movements of the pink snake
      that swam around in its brain.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen could feel the bone elephant&#8217;s life force, and with this
      ability, he gauged the precise time he should cast his powerful attack.
    </p>

    <p>
      Suddenly, Han Sen&#8217;s pupils shrunk. His body burst with power, like a
      raging scream. He struck the bone elephant&#8217;s head with his fiery
      palms.
    </p>

    <p>Pang!</p>

    <p>
      The powerful Elephant-Rex Strike was sent directly into the
      elephant&#8217;s brain. It was like a torpedo in the deep sea, detonating
      the brain from the inside.
    </p>

    <blockquote>
      <p>
        &#8220;Super Creature Hunted: Saint-Bone Elephant. The Beast Soul Has
        Not Been Acquired. Consume Its Flesh To Obtain A Random Numeric Amount
        Of Super Geno Points, Ranging From Zero To Ten. You May Also Collect The
        Life Geno Essence.&#8221;
      </p>
    </blockquote>

    <p>
      As the announcement played in Han Sen&#8217;s head, the pink snake
      launched out of the dead elephant&#8217;s ear. It was like a star, falling
      into the forest. It disappeared.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen saw traces of pink blood sprayed across the floor, so it looked
      like his palm had dealt it some decent damage.
    </p>

    <p>
      He was overjoyed. Because his fitness was not as high as it could be, the
      Elephant-Rex Strike was only enough to mop up an easy kill. It
      wasn&#8217;t strong enough to kill a super creature at full health.
    </p>

    <p>
      But Han Sen had damaged the thin pink snake, which prompted it to fly
      away. It was fairly obvious that the snake was heavily damaged. Perhaps it
      had already been injured during the scramble to get into the
      elephant&#8217;s brain, or being in there the entire time. Regardless, it
      seemed to have run off for good.
    </p>

    <p>
      After all, the bone elephant was a second-generation super creature. Even
      if it did drill inside its body, the pink snake must have exhausted a lot
      of effort and strength to do so.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen was just glad that the pink snake was spooked. The snake must have
      had no idea such a strike was coming. Only being able to perform such a
      strike once, it was fortunate the hit was as effective as it was.
      Otherwise, Han Sen might have had trouble making his escape.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen quickly summoned his angel. He wanted to see if she&#8217;d eat
      the bone elephant, for perhaps this would be what it needed to evolve.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen did not take the retrieval of beast souls as seriously as he used
      to. Obtaining them was no longer as important to him. His biggest priority
      lately was figuring out how he could consume the Life Geno essences.
    </p>

    <p>
      Angel saw the body of the Saint-Bone Elephant, and when she saw it, her
      eyes glowed red. With a ravenous appetite, she leapt onto it. She grabbed
      its bones and began munching on them with a rabid hunger, the sounds of
      snapping cartilage ringing through the air. Snap, snap, snap—she broke the
      bones, sucked on the marrow, and crunched on the tusks like glass.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen was frozen. He thought that the angel&#8217;s teeth were a bit too
      hard. Watching her nibble her way through a mound of super creature bones
      was a little frightening.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen summoned his Flaming-Rex Spike and hit the elephant&#8217;s skull
      with it, hoping to crack it open and obtain the Life Geno essence. That
      was all he personally needed; nothing else mattered to him.
    </p>

    <p>
      But surprisingly for Han Sen, the bones were not as hard as he expected.
      It seemed that after the bone elephant&#8217;s death, the bones softened
      somewhat. The rex spike broke the top of the skull open like a pinata,
      letting out the run of white, creamy brain juice.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen was rather shocked, but at least he understood how the angel was
      able to eat it so ferociously. After death, the elephant&#8217;s bones
      really weren&#8217;t all that hard.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen drilled inside the brain for a while and rummaged through the
      muculent brain juice. After a fair amount of time, he managed to find the
      bone-like Life Geno essence he had been looking for.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen was so happy. But during this happiness, he heard a sound from all
      around him. A sea of snakes were slithering towards him. It looked like
      the pink snake was not too fond of Han Sen&#8217;s theft, and it seemed as
      if it had rallied its brethren to kill him.
    </p>

    <p>
      The pink snake was riding the back of another snake. This mount-snake was
      a large titanboa. The pink snake was hissing at Han Sen with obvious anger
      and frustration.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen felt bad, seeing the angel munch upon the bone elephant. It would
      probably take a long time for her to eat it all. But with Han Sen&#8217;s
      current weakness, if the snakes attacked, he&#8217;d have no hope of
      repelling them all.
    </p>

    <p>
      He considered whether or not he should quickly grab the angel and escape,
      leaving behind the bone elephant&#8217;s flesh in the process. But
      suddenly, he heard a bear roar. Looking to the top of the hill, he saw two
      bears, one big and one small, roaring in his direction. They rushed down
      the hill towards him, tearing up the legions of snakes in the process.
      Nothing could withstand their rabid claws.
    </p>

    <p>
      They stopped near the body of the bone elephant. Not entirely sure what
      was going on, Han Sen thought he should summon his wings and fly away.
    </p>

    <p>
      But the big black bear seemed really human; it nodded to Han Sen. And then
      the bear turned around and roared at the pink snake.
    </p>

    <p>
      The pink snake hissed in response. They both groaned and made noises to
      each other, staring one another down. After a while of this, the pink
      snake gave Han Sen one last jealous look before turning around and leaving
      alongside the rest of its snakes. The tide of snakes washed away.
    </p>

    <p>
      The big bear then roared to Han Sen. It picked up the cub, put it back on
      its back, and returned to the woods.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen was shocked, not entirely sure what had just happened. How and why
      would the two bears come all the way over here just to repel the snakes
      that had threatened him?
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Did they think the reason I fought the bone elephant was because I
      wanted to help them? Was this them returning the favor?&#8221; Han Sen
      didn&#8217;t know for sure, but this was what he hypothesized.
    </p>

    <p>
      But regardless of why it had happened, it was a good thing. He had already
      decided to fly away with the angel and escape. This unexpected turn of
      events allowed the angel to munch on the elephant in its entirety.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen sat on the floor and rested, observing the surrounding area. He
      wasn&#8217;t simply taking in the view, though. He wanted to make sure the
      snake was gone for good and didn&#8217;t plan on backstabbing Han Sen by
      coming back once the bear had left.
    </p>

    <p>
      But Han Sen was just being paranoid, and the pink snake made no plan to
      return. Han Sen&#8217;s energy was also nearing complete recovery, without
      the sight of a single other creature around.
    </p>

    <p>
      The angel was still eating the bone elephant, and by now, she was almost
      halfway through her meal.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;The super creatures of the Second God&#8217;s Sanctuary are
      so&#8230; human. The children, especially so. They are appearing more and
      more intelligent every time I see them. What will things be like when I
      reach the Third God&#8217;s Sanctuary?&#8221; Han Sen was in deep thought,
      as he tossed the bone elephant&#8217;s essence in his hand.
    </p>

    <p>
      It was a curious thing, like a fusion of bone and jade. But it was
      slightly transparent, too. This Life Geno essence did not look violent and
      red, and it was a whole lot more like the peaceful bone elephant he had
      once witnessed sitting beneath a tree, meditating. It wasn&#8217;t at all
      representative of the ordinary bone elephant he was used to seeing.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;I hope I can eat it this time. If I can&#8217;t, I&#8217;m really
      out of solutions for how I might collect the super geno points I
      need.&#8221; Han Sen gave the Life Geno essence a good lick.
    </p>

    <p>
      The result was disappointing. The Life Geno essence did not change. It was
      still as solid as ever; it did not melt and it continued to look like
      bone.
