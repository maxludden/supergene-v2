Han Sen thought the Blue Gold Demon Bug had an overwhelming urge to kill, and it had gone for the xenogeneics first because they were closest.

Han Sen summoned Spell as a sniper rifle and used the scope to track the Blue Gold Demon Bug as it flew above the xenogeneics. It opened its mouth and let out a high-pitched screech.

In the next second, the eyes of the xenogeneics all turned red. The mass of xenogeneics began to churn, stirring themselves into a frenzy. And when the Blue Gold Demon Bug screamed again, they all started stampeding towards the base.

“Oh no! The Blue Gold Demon Bugs can control xenogeneics? I hope they can only control the low-intelligence variety. If they can take over the big ones, Narrow Moon is done for.” Han Sen took aim with his sniper rifle and pulled the trigger without hesitation. A bullet was fired, and it went speeding into the Blue Gold Demon Bug’s left eye.

The bullet perforated the bug’s eyeball and became lodged in the socket. There was, however, a spell placed on the bullet. The bug became so slow that it started to fall to the ground. Turtle was very useful against foes that relied on speed and flight.

Han Sen donned his rabbit shoes and summoned dragon wings for his ears and back. His body glowed red as he shot off towards the Blue Gold Demon Bug. He lifted Ghost Teeth Knife, and using Tusk, he sliced the Turtlized bug into pieces.

“Xenogeneic Marquise hunted. Blue Gold Demon Bug: xenogeneic gene found.”

When the Blue Gold Demon Bug died, the xenogeneics that were under its influence returned to normal again. They felt Han Sen’s presence and quickly ran off.

Han Sen looked to the sky, but most of the creatures he knew were above him were too dark to see. Only the King class and half-deified bugs that were fighting Yisha and the others were visible against the sky. They were fighting in space, shining bright against the stars.

He couldn’t see them, but he knew the Blue Gold Demon Bugs were probably descending on other planets.

“You guys stay on the planet. I’m going to go take a look.” Han Sen thought Planet Eclipse was safe for now. He left Little Star behind, flapping his dragon wings as he sped off into space.

Han Sen flew around the King class Blue Gold Demon Bugs. He was far enough away that he only saw flashes in the distance, and he couldn’t see the fight properly.

The blue lights and the purple knife airs were like a magnetic storm in space. Han Sen could tell Yisha was the one that was guiding the fight, but if things continued as they were, they’d end up destroying the planet.

Han Sen flew by the planet closest to Planet Eclipse, and he noted that there weren’t many Blue Gold Demon Bugs there. He continued past, headed for the planet with the blue metal cube.

He figured that place would have the most Blue Gold Demon Bugs, so it was his target. The more he killed, the less damage would be dealt to Narrow Moon.

The bugs had the power to control low-intelligence xenogeneics. That was more dangerous than the bugs themselves. The planet that hosted the blue metal cube had many low-intelligence xenogeneics, and if the bugs gained control of them all, the situation would get completely out of hand.

It appeared that Narrow Moon’s elites shared Han Sen’s fear, because they were also focusing on that planet. When the Blue Gold Demon Bugs appeared, the Rebate had been thrown into utter chaos. But even so, not much damage was dealt. The Dukes quickly organized the fight and evacuated those who weren’t strong enough to fight.

Rebecca and the other youngsters were fighting Blue Gold Demon Bugs, too. They used the geography of the landscape to their advantage.

Not long after, an explosion sounded from outside the city. An earthquake followed, as angry roars and scary screams rolled over the city.

Someone went to take a look, and they saw an endless horde of xenogeneics coming from every direction. Their eyes were all red. They were going to charge into the city.

A flying group of Blue Gold Demon Bugs squealed menacingly in the air, driving the xenogeneics toward the city. Rebecca was aiding the evacuation of civilians, and her face turned pale when she realized what was happening.

“Oh no! Those metal monsters can control xenogeneics?” Rebecca groaned.

“That asshole Sad Night! He has destroyed Narrow Moon,” Du Lishe hissed. If the xenogeneics got into the city, most people below the rank of Duke were going to die.

To make the situation even worse, Yisha and Black Moon King had yet to kill their opponents. There were no reinforcements to call in.

Bzzt!

A weird noise sounded, and a green light rose from the city. The sight was a relief to everyone watching.

A high voltage laser net had been activated outside the city. It was very effective against creatures that were Duke and below. If it could block the creatures coming in from the outside, the city would be a fair bit safer.

But they soon found out that the net wasn’t enough. The crazed xenogeneics were still coming, climbing over the fallen bodies of their allies to slip through the net. A path was built with the charred corpses, and xenogeneics flooded the city like a burst dam.

An ape-like xenogeneic broke down a building, while a dragon-like creature soared in the air, raining down an inferno of fire across the land. Death and blood were everywhere.

Rebecca and Du Lishe felt hopeless. They could not deal with that many xenogeneics.

“Kill the Blue Gold Demon Bugs that control the xenogeneics!” A red shadow flashed over the city, flying high above the xenogeneics.

A purple knife with scary knife air came flying by, killing any flying xenogeneics it touched.

“Overbearing Teeth, please lend me your strength to slay these Blue Gold Demon Bugs!” Han Sen flew in front of the xenogeneic and Blue Gold Demon Bug armies.

“Too many xenogeneics. We can’t reach them!” Overbearing Teeth shouted. He had tried leading the Dukes past the xenogeneics, but the Blue Gold Demon Bugs were smart. Wherever the bugs went, they commanded the xenogeneics to protect them. The Dukes could not reach the bugs no matter how many creatures were killed.

“Follow my attack!” Han Sen shouted, before putting Ghost Teeth Knife back in its sheath. Spell became a rocket launcher on his shoulders, and then he fired. His blood red body followed after the smoky trail.

*Boom!*

The rocket exploded amidst the xenogeneics. The shot didn’t have enough destructive power to do too much damage to Marquise xenogeneics, but when the shockwave of the explosion brushed the enemy, it made them far slower. Turtle marks appeared on their bodies.
