<h2>Back to Narrow Moon</h2>
<h3>Chapter 2076</h3>

<p>Han Sen submitted an application at the general services
building, requesting that his daughter be allowed to join him in
Sky Palace. He received permission, and so he left Sky Palace and
returned to Planet Eclipse to pick her up.</p>
<p>Han Sen was careful not to attract attention on the trip, and
his return voyage was not impeded by troubles. He brought Bao’er
into the geno universe half-way, and then went to Narrow Moon.</p>
<p>He took Bao’er to meet Yisha, who quickly grew fond of her. She
allowed Bao’er to stay on Planet Blade, while Han Sen went back to
Planet Eclipse.</p>
<p>Han Sen knew that Yisha intended to investigate Bao’er. The
Rebate did not have strictly enforced rules like Sky Palace, but
they wouldn’t allow someone unknown to occupy a high level
district.</p>
<p>It wasn’t as if she was an ordinary immigrant, either. Relatives
of an important person required some testing to see how far along
they themselves might have progressed.</p>
<p>Han Sen wasn’t worried, though. Bao’er was incredibly smart, and
he was sure she’d have no problems.</p>
<p>Back on Planet Eclipse, Xie Qing King, Gu Qingcheng, and the
others had all become Earls. Zero, Dragon Lady, Han Meng’er, Little
Angel, and Wang Yuhang were Earls, too.</p>
<p>Han Sen’s friends had geno arts that were easier to level up
than The Story of Genes, and they did not have to practice four
different geno arts at the same time, either. In combination with
the many resources of Planet Eclipse, this allowed them to level up
quickly.</p>
<p>“Old Han! We are already Earls, and the resources on Planet
Eclipse can’t support us beyond Marquise. We would like to explore
and practice off-world.” Xie Qing King told Han Sen.</p>
<p>Gu Qingcheng, Wang Yuhang, and Dragon Lady wished to do the
same. Han Sen agreed to let them practice someplace else, but he
also tasked them with recruiting. That way, Han Sen could bring
more people from the Alliance, when they returned.</p>
<p>Perhaps it was because of the gold bird markings, but the
refugees that populated Han Sen’s base were now Baron nobles. He
had enough people there, as well.</p>
<p>“Han Sen, I have heard about you killing Sharon and Dragon
Thirteen, beating Dragon Nine in Return Ruin Sea… Your name is all
over the geno universe! Everyone knows Knife Queen has a genius
student named Han Sen now.” Black Steel came to Planet Eclipse,
looking troubled. He went on to say, “But until I become a Duke,
Father won’t allow me to leave Narrow Moon. I really want to go and
explore with you.”</p>
<p>“If you want to practice, Narrow Moon is the same as anywhere
else you could go. There’s little difference. Compared to what I’ve
been doing, I’d rather remain in Narrow Moon. I would stay here if
I had a choice.” Han Sen laughed.</p>
<p>“Don’t say that. I’m not leaving, anyway,” Black Steel sighed.
“By the way, Rebecca is throwing a welcome party. I am here to
invite you to come.”</p>
<p>“I don’t have a very good relationship with the people of Moon
Garden. Why would they think of inviting me?” Han Sen was
surprised.</p>
<p>Black Steel rolled his eyes. “Things are different now. You have
earned a brilliant reputation out there, so now you’re Narrow
Moon’s golden boy. No one wants a rivalry with you now. Given the
absence of any grudges you might have been worried about, perhaps
you should go and pay them a visit?”</p>
<p>“Sure. I’ll take your advice.” Han Sen smiled.</p>
<p>He went to Planet Moon Wheel with Black Steel. Rebecca, Du
Lishe, and the heirs of other Kings were all gathered there.</p>
<p>This gathering was quite different from the knife events that
Han Sen had attended before. Back then, no one cared for him.
Everyone looked down on him, and they didn’t bother speaking to
him. But now things were different. Han Sen was like a visiting
celebrity. The heirs of every King were very polite to him,
constantly complimenting him. He talked to more people on that one
night than in all the time he had lived in Narrow Moon before.</p>
<p>Han Sen had placed first in the Sky Palace exam and fought Lone
Bamboo. He killed Sharon and Dragon Thirteen, and he also beat
Dragon Nine. All those feats made Han Sen the first of a new
generation of elites in the geno universe.</p>
<p>Although Han Sen had a low chance of ever becoming a King, it
wasn’t an impossible task. No one wanted to make him an enemy,
either.</p>
<p>“Ha! It’s only his fifteen seconds of fame. All of this is
nothing to boast about. It’s all for naught if he can’t become a
King, anyway.” Sad Night, who was supposed to be the focus of the
night’s proceedings, was sitting in a corner and whining into his
drink.</p>
<p>Night River King had the biggest grudge with Han Sen. Sad Night
harbored one, too. He didn’t like Han Sen becoming so famous.</p>
<p>“These guys are really short-sighted. They only see Han Sen’s
fame now. They aren’t paying any attention to the difficulty Han
Sen has leveling up his geno arts. There is no way he’ll become a
King. It’s really funny how they’re licking his boots now.” Sad
Night heard a voice. He turned around and saw a young Earl Rebate
walking towards him with a drink.</p>
<p>Sad Night frowned. He did not recognize the young man. Perhaps
it was someone of little renown. The young Earl raised a cup to Sad
Night and said, “Mister Night, my name is Vikdo. Can I speak to you
alone after the event?”</p>
<p>“What for?” Sad Night looked at him with disdain.</p>
<p>“I have a way in which you could beat Han Sen and take his fame
for yourself. Are you interested?” Vikdo said.</p>
<p>You can do that?” Sad Night raised an eyebrow, but he didn’t
seem too interested in the young man’s claim.</p>
<p>“I’m not an important person. There is no reason for you to be
impressed by me. But you recognize this, don’t you?” Vikdo pulled
out his phone and showed Sad Night a video.</p>
<p>When Sad Night saw it, he looked stunned. He balked, “Where did
you take this?”</p>
<p>“If you are interested, then let’s resume speaking after the
event concludes.” Vikdo smiled.</p>
<p>After the event was over, Rebecca and Du Lishe escorted Han Sen
out. They brought him right to the boarding ramp of his
aircraft.</p>
<p>“Brother Han, if we have done something to upset you, it’s
because we acted foolishly. Please don’t hold it against us,”
Rebecca said, then presented Han Sen with a box. “This is a gift
we’d like you to accept. It is an apology, and a hope that you’ll
forgive us, for the way we mistreated you in the past.”</p>
<p>“It’s okay. Even friends argue sometimes. And I was new to
Narrow Moon. I didn’t know you guys,” Han Sen said with a
shrug.</p>
<p>“Even so, please take this. How about we be friends?” Rebecca
smiled, placing the wooden box in front of him.</p>
<p>“You guys are so nice. Thank you!” Han Sen took the wooden box
and smiled at them both.</p>
