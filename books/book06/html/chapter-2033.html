<h2>Xenogeneic Demon Dragon</h2>
<h3>Chapter 2033</h3>

<p>Her blood spread like flower petals. Her powerful Dragon body
could not hold strong against the countless wounds that were being
ravaged by the Teeth power. Her body was ultimately tom apart.</p>
<p>Han Sen moved into a hidden passage nearby. There, he started to
use his own strength to purge his body of the Evilbreaker Lance’s
power.</p>
<p>That power was strange. When it gathered up, it was like refined
steel. If you were not strong enough, then you couldn’t break it.
But if you used too much strength, then it was possible for you to
harm your own body. Han Sen couldn’t get it out of himself.</p>
<p>Han Sen did not have much time to think, though. He used his
Dongxuan Aura to analyze the Evilbreaker power infection, and then,
the Evilbreaker powers appeared in Han Sen’s brain like a
sequence.</p>
<p>The moment Dragon Thirteen died, Sharon had been able to feel
it. His eyes darkened, and his scimitar raged with even greater
strength. He struck the silver bug’s shield and broke its
armor.</p>
<p>The silver glass bug squealed and started to fly away. Sharon
was no longer paying attention to it, though. Immediately, he
turned and went for Dragon Thirteen.</p>
<p>Seeing Dragon Thirteen’s exploded body, Sharon looked murderous.
He clutched his scimitar and ran towards Han Sen.</p>
<p>Han Sen frowned. He had thought that without Dragon Thirteen,
Sharon would be unable to find him. It looked as if he had been
wrong, though. Sharon was coming right for him.</p>
<p>Han Sen did not know that Sharon had Evilbreaker powers, too.
And Sharon could sense the force of the Evilbreaker Lance inside
Han Sen.</p>
<p>Han Sen couldn’t spend much time worrying about this, though. He
used Super Spank to attack the Evilbreaker Lance’s power. He tried
to break the sequence structure of the affliction, and he damaged
himself a little in the attempt.</p>
<p>Those two Evilbreaker powers crumbled into dust, though.</p>
<p>Sharon was already in front of the passage. He turned a
murderous glare on Han Sen and said, “The pain that Thirteen
suffered will be returned to you, a thousand times over.”</p>
<p>Then his black-light flashing scimitar came striking at Han Sen,
who was still sitting.</p>
<p>Han Sen shouted, moved like a crane, and jumped out of the
little passage. His Blood Feather Knife blocked Sharon’s black
light.</p>
<p>Dong!</p>
<p>As his body was sent flying, Han Sen felt ripples of scary power
from where the knife air and the light collided. He went crashing
into a wall, and quite a bit of it fell down around him.</p>
<p>“You have combined Sky-Demon powers with Evilbreaker powers?”
Han Sen gripped his chest in pain as he came staggering out of the
rubble.</p>
<p>“You blocked my Sky-Demon power that can never miss. You are
very strong.” Sharon looked even more murderous. The black light he
wielded shone brighter at Han Sen.</p>
<p>Han Sen used a few skills, but he still couldn’t dodge Sharon’s
scimitar. He could only fight back, but his power was not as great
as Sharon’s. He was knocked away, and he uncontrollably heaved up
blood in the air.</p>
<p>Sharon’s power was leagues greater than Dragon Thirteen’s. That
was why he was the same as Lone Bamboo.</p>
<p>He possessed both Sky-Demon and Evilbreaker powers. Han Sen knew
all about the Sky-Demon powers, but even so, it was very difficult
to dodge.</p>
<p>Seeing Sharon attack, Han Sen did not hesitate to use his
Dongxuan Aura. The knife and sword powers gathered across his
blade. He saw the world as nothing more than a realm of sequence
structures.</p>
<p>The scimitar came against Han Sen’s Blood Feather Knife. The
powers of Super Spank could break sequence structures. And with it,
he was able to shatter the black light coming for him. The scimitar
Han Sen’s opponent wielded was reduced to dust.</p>
<p>Sharon’s face went pale, and he looked even more enraged than he
had earlier. He stared at Han Sen’s knife.</p>
<p>Han Sen had broken the knifelight and the knife’s sequence
structure, but he had still been blasted back ten meters. He hit
another wall. There was still a large gulf of power separating the
two.</p>
<p>“Good… good… It is no wonder you were able to fight Lone Bamboo.
Of the Marquises, I doubt any have the ability to adequately fight
you. You’re the best Earl there is, but today you meet me: Sharon.”
Sharon looked right at Han Sen as he spoke.</p>
<p>Every word was pronounced with utter contempt, with a bubbling
desire to rip Han Sen apart.</p>
<p>The next second, Sharon’s black light shone again. His purple
horns turned black, and his body became three feet taller. His
armor broke in his transformation, as his muscles bulged and became
clad in scales.</p>
<p>The bones in his back broke and spread apart, becoming black
dragon wings. The nails grew to become sharp, bladelike talons.</p>
<p>The strange glowing black was now covering his entire body. It
was like he had been painted in a black light.</p>
<p>Buzz!</p>
<p>Sharon’s strong body disappeared from Han Sen’s vision. Han Sen
did not have the time to react, and the enemy appeared in his face
again. The blade-like talons pierced through his armor and
flesh.</p>
<p>The crystal-looking blood began to come out of his body in a
stream as he was sent flying. Before Han Sen landed, Sharon
appeared next to him. The talons came to strike his arm.</p>
<p>Han Sen used his prediction abilities, combined it with Super
Spank and his knife, and attacked back at Sharon’s hand.</p>
<p>But his vision was blurred, and Sharon disappeared once more.
When he reappeared, his knee was striking Han Sen in his back. It
sent Han Sen to the sky, up until he crashed into a stony ceiling.
Pang!</p>
<p>Sharon waved his talons, and his black light continued to
shatter that ceiling. It punched a hole completely through.</p>
<p>Sharon was in xenogeneic mode. He had the blood of the Demon and
Dragon. His power was scary, and even a Duke would die under this
onslaught.</p>
<p>Han Sen fell down across the rocks, his body soaked in blood.
His armor was on the precipice of destruction. Han Sen knew there
was a power gap between the two, and it wasn’t anywhere close.</p>
<p>The different between Han Sen and Sharon was like an ordinary
Earl versus an ordinary Marquise. They were better than their
levels defined them as, but the gap was still exceptionally
wide.</p>
<p>Even with the powers of Super Spank, Han Sen couldn’t touch
Sharon. He couldn’t break his sequence structure.</p>
<p>“I won’t have you die so easily. I will skin the flesh from your
bones, and I guarantee that you will die in a far cruder and more
painful manner than Thirteen did.” Sharon’s every word sounded like
he was spitting a curse. He moved his body again and appeared in
front of Han Sen. He was going to grab his opponent’s body.</p>
<p>Han Sen wasn’t even able to dodge, let alone draw his knife.</p>
<p>As Sharon’s sharp talons swooped down to perforate his body, a
white light suddenly appeared in Han Sen’s eye.</p>
