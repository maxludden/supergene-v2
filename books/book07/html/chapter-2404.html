<h2>Han Sen Makes His Wish</h2>
<h3>Chapter 2404</h3>

<p>Han Sen thought of many different things he could wish for. He
thought of wishing for God to be dead or for Han Sen himself to
become God. Both of those seemed like wishes that God would be
unable to fulfill, and thus would be forced to renege on his
bargain.</p>
<p>But when Han Sen thought about it some more, he realized that
those wishes wouldn’t work. If Han Sen wished for God to die, he
needed a way to make sure that God really was dead.</p>
<p>Ordinarily, death meant losing all signs of life. But different
types of life also had different types of life signs.</p>
<p>When Han Sen first entered the seventh floor and saw the man, he
thought the man was dead. If that was the “death” Han Sen was
referring to, then God would fulfill his wish without difficulty.
He could make himself lose all signs of life without being
negatively impacted.</p>
<p>If Han Sen was going to make that sort of wish, he should wish
that God had never existed. If God never existed, then he wouldn’t
be around to fulfill Han Sen’s wishes. If he fulfilled Han Sen’s
wishes, then he wouldn’t be around to call in the debt. If he was
still around to exact payment, then he could not have fulfilled the
wish.</p>
<p>It was a simple theory, and the wish should have been impossible
to fulfill.</p>
<p>The wish made certain assumptions, though. If Han Sen really
wished for God to never exist, then the assumption would be that
the man really was God. If the man told Han Sen he was not God, it
would be as if he was erasing God’s existence. And then he could
make Han Sen pay the price.</p>
<p>There were many other similar methods that God could use to
avoid getting the bad end of a bargain. God was very good when it
came to toying with rules. Because of that, Han Sen didn’t think
that any of these ideas would work.</p>
<p>Han Sen’s gaze came down on the paintings of God hanging on the
walls, and suddenly, Han Sen saw them very differently than he had
before. The position of the paintings hadn’t changed, but looking
at them now gave Han Sen a very different sensation.</p>
<p>Han Sen felt a water mind coming from one picture. The water
mind was like a sea. It washed back and forth over Han Sen, making
him feel as if he was drowning in the image. His sensitivity to
water powers increased.</p>
<p>Han Sen was shocked. He looked at all of the pictures one by
one, and he found that each of them had a different meaning. Some
of them were very soft and gentle, whereas others were very hard
and destructive.</p>
<p>Some of them were small, and others were endless. Others were
like galaxies hanging in the sky.</p>
<p>The forty-eight pictures somehow captured all the different
aspects of water powers. Han Sen looked at the forty-eight
paintings, and his knowledge of water powers increased by several
levels.</p>
<p>“It looks like God’s power really is quite impressive. It can
read my body composition and place a water mind in the paintings
for me. When the Extreme King elites came here, they must have each
seen a mind that matched their own powers. That is why they became
so much stronger.</p>
<p>Frowning, Han Sen muttered to himself, “This God is like King
Qun. They both have very strong powers, but for some reason, there
are restrictions that keep them from utilizing all of their
strength. This is the only chance I have against them, as the
ordinary creature that I am. Otherwise, this God could surely
destroy the universe itself.”</p>
<p>“But fighting a god by God’s rules? The chances of winning are
still pretty low.” Han Sen then suddenly thought of Asura.</p>
<p>Asura left behind the Asura Sutra, or the Falsified-Sky Sutra,
which had Causal powers. And Asura had actually consumed a God. Was
that God the same type as King Qun?</p>
<p>But Han Sen had eventually learned that the God Asura consumed
was something like a Buddha. Although the Buddha were strong, they
didn’t reach God-status.</p>
<p>“Maybe that was just a coincidence,” Han Sen thought to
himself.</p>
<p>Han Sen kept looking at the forty-eight paintings, all the while
thinking about what he might wish for. Gaining more water power was
great for Han Sen.</p>
<p>Ancient Water God’s Ancient God Origin had caused the Original
Water King Body to develop, so the King area’s utility had
definitely increased. Learning more through these paintings would
also be helpful.</p>
<p>But because of his black crystal armor, Han Sen’s body was
locked down. That God could probably only feel the Original Water
King Body, which was why the paintings only held a water mind.</p>
<p>If Han Sen had access to all his geno arts, he could have
learned a great deal more from the paintings.</p>
<p>But the black crystal armor wasn’t giving Han Sen the
opportunity to do that, and Han Sen couldn’t understand why. It was
similar to how the black crystal armor had hidden from the geno
hall.</p>
<p>A month was a long time, though. Han Sen was able to think about
all this slowly, as he had plenty of time to learn the water minds
that were available.</p>
<p>With his own water mind knowledge deepening, Han Sen’s water
element Shocking Sky Punch became stronger. As he understood more
and more, Han Sen continued to modify the technique.</p>
<p>Han Sen hadn’t yet made a wish. This was the last day he would
be allowed to remain inside the tower, and he was still learning
the water minds in the paintings.</p>
<p>The painting in front of Han Sen started to talk. “You made a
deal with me. You must make a wish. If you don’t, you cannot be
allowed to leave Destiny’s Tower. And you know this.”</p>
<p>Han Sen laughed and said, “I am going to make the wish now.”</p>
<p>God was threatening Han Sen. If Han Sen didn’t keep his promise,
he wouldn’t be allowed out even if the Extreme King opened
Destiny’s Tower.</p>
<p>But Han Sen thought this threat was very interesting.</p>
<p>It seemed that, for some reason, God didn’t want to offend the
Extreme King. Otherwise, he would have just let Han Sen reach the
time limit without reminding him.</p>
<p>That proved that God was planning to let Han Sen go instead of
forcing him to stay.</p>
<p>“Then come to me and tell me your wish,” the man said in a cool
voice. His face remained impassive.</p>
<p>Han Sen returned to the seventh floor of Destiny’s Tower and
walked in front of the man.</p>
<p>“You do not have much time. Tell me your wish,” the man
said.</p>
<p>“Can you fulfill any wish I want?” Han Sen asked, looking at the
man.</p>
<p>“Yes. Anything you want,” the man surely said.</p>
<p>“Can I look for someone?” Han Sen asked.</p>
<p>“Of course.” The man was answering without hesitation.</p>
<p>He must have heard many strange wishes in his time. Looking for
someone might have been a very common wish.</p>
<p>“Good. Then, can you please tell me where my great-granddad is?”
Han Sen didn’t make a tricky wish or try to trap God. His wish was
simple.</p>
<p>When the man heard it, he thought the wish was very simple, as
well. He wouldn’t have to bend the rules to fulfill this
request.</p>
<p>“What is your great-grandfather’s name?” the man asked.</p>
<p>“Aren’t you God? You must know.” Han Sen said with a
chuckle.</p>
<p>“Fine,” the man said casually. He looked at Han Sen, but the
reflection in his eyes kept changing.</p>
