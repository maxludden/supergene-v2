<p>The blonde Wan’er had the will of the Qin Kingdom’s Wan’er. The black-haired Qin Wan’er had the will of the Witch Wan’er. It did not matter which will was in control. She would always retain the memories from both worlds. It was just her personality that would greatly differ depending on which was in control.</p>

<p>The blonde Qin Wan’er called Qin Xiu a brother. The black-haired Qin Wan’er added his name, Qin Xiu, after it.</p>

<p>“I just woke up,” the black-haired Wan’er answered.</p>

<p>Qin Xiu did not see anything amiss in the old tower, and his security system was still untampered. No creature had been detected. Qin Xiu was confused.</p>

<p>Qin Xiu looked at Wan’er and asked, “Wan’er, who has been here?”</p>

<p>“No one came,” Wan’er replied.</p>

<p>Qin Xiu was smart. By looking at Wan’er’s face, he knew someone had paid a visit. After a brief thought, he asked, “What did Han Sen do here?”</p>

<p>Wan’er was frightened, but she quickly explained, “Big Brother did not mean me any harm. He only came to visit me.”</p>

<p>“It is fine,” Qin Xiu softly said, despite the sting of betrayal on show in his eyes. “As long as you are happy, you can have anything. If you want to see him again, I can make him come here and let him visit you more often.”</p>

<p>“Oh, really, Brother Qin Xiu?” Wan’er was shocked and happy.</p>

<p>“Of course, you sweet dumpling. Just be happy, and I will do anything I can in my power to sustain that joy.” Qin Xiu rubbed Wan’er on the nose and smiled.</p>

<p>“Thank you, Brother Qin Xiu,” Wan’er happily said.</p>

<p>“Do you know where Han Sen went?” Qin Xiu inquired. “I can go and get him. I can bring him over here to meet you.”</p>

<p>Wan’er shook her head. “I do not know where Big Brother went. He only said he would come and see me in the future.”</p>

<p>“That is fine. I will find him. If you like it, no matter where he is, I will bring him right here in front of you.” Qin Xiu stroked Wan’er’s hair and looked at her softly.</p>

<p>After leaving the old tower, Qin Xiu looked very cold. “What did Han Sen do? He made Wan’er’s will take over her other will. It looks like I have to put my skates on and speed things up.”</p>

<p>After a few steps, Qin Xiu traveled through space to visit a jail.</p>

<p>“Mister Leader, you are here!” Shoot Shadow kneeled.</p>

<p>“How is the life soul combination process fairing?” Qin Xiu looked at Sky King who was currently chained to a metal pillar.</p>

<p>Sky King’s body had been shredded by various meat hooks that kept him in place. The chains were connected to a giant block of copper that looked like a beast. There was a weird spirit air coming out from the copper. It was going to the chains that went into Sky King’s body. It made Sky King howl in pain.</p>

<p>“Reporting to Mister Leader, I can confirm that things have been going well,” Shoot Shadow quickly replied. “His Break World rate has reached 83%. It is very stable. I believe that it will not be too long before he reaches 90% out of 100.”</p>

<p>“Very good,” Qin Xiu said. “Keep things on track with our timing. We must make his Break World rate hit 90%, but we cannot afford any mistakes. We need him and his power to break the 33 skies.”</p>

<p>“Do not worry, Mister Leader. I will not disappoint you.” After speaking, Shoot Shadow curiously asked, “Mister Leader, do you know where this guy even came from? How can his power react to the 33 skies? It is quite hard to believe.”</p>

<p>“There is no more time for chit-chat,” Qin Xiu coldly said. “That is how long we live.”</p>

<p>“My mistake.” Shoot Shadow’s face changed. He kowtowed on the floor, shaking madly with fear.</p>

<p>Qin Xiu ignored Shoot Shadow’s behavior. He looked at Sky King and said to himself, “With him, we should be able to break the 33 skies in three months.”</p>

<p>Han Sen stayed in the geno universe for two or three days. Every day, he took Ling’er to visit Ji Yanran and watch her kill xenogeneics. It was a fun thing to do.</p>

<p>Ji Yanran was now in the geno universe. She was steadily practicing her battle talents, but her battle abilities were admittedly not the best. Fortunately, she was talented with Xuan. Han Sen taught her Under the Sky Knife skills. She learned them quickly.</p>

<p>Han Sen was studying the Story of Genes. After it became solid, he used the reverse the Story of Genes and managed to reign it in. It was no longer as dangerous as it used to be.</p>

<p>Although sometimes the geno chains exploded, it was better than what happened before. It was now mostly able to be kept under control. He used the Dao member’s reverse the Story of Genes to his own advantage. Now, he could successfully use the Story of Genes, but he really wanted to combine the main and reverse into one. He was going to need even more knowledge of the Story of Genes for that to happen. He was not done yet.</p>

<p>Han Sen cared even more about his body’s changes.</p>

<div class="tables">
    <table class="status">
        <tr>
            <th colspan="2">Han Sen</th>
        </tr><tr>
        	<td>Super Body</td>
        	<td>Super God Spirit Body</td>
        </tr><tr>
            <th class="note" colspan="2"> Break World</th>
        </tr>
    </table>
    <!--Han Sen: Super God Spirit body (Break World)-->
    <table class="center">
		<tr>
            <th colspan="2">Break World</th>
        </tr><tr>
        	<td>Break World Genes</td>
        	<td>0</td>
        </tr>
    </table>
    <!--Break World Gene: Zero-->
</div>

<p>That confused Han Sen quite a bit. The Break World genes he knew were more practically defined as a Break World rating. The Super God Spirit body’s Break World rate was based on what Han Sen used to have.</p>

<p>Han Sen did not understand this. The Break World mode of the Super God Spirit body could not touch anything. No matter how high a Break World rate was, it was useless. He could only fight in his solid mode. The Super God Spirit body was useless.</p>

<p>Han Sen had tried it many times. With that Super God Spirit body, Han Sen could only run the Story of Genes. After running the Story of Genes, he would get his body back. He would then exit Super God Spirit mode.</p>

<p>In that mode, normal people could not see him. Even Break World creatures could not see him, especially when he was fighting. Only a handful of people, such as Ling’er and Littleflower, could see him.</p>

<p>Han Sen was most surprised about the fact that Zero and Little Angel could see him. He was quite confused by this.</p>

<p>Zero and Little Angel did not have spirit bodies. They did not have a spirit body type. It was unknown how they were able to see him.</p>

<p>Even if they were able to see him, it was useless. Even though Ling’er could see Han Sen, she could not touch his body.</p>

<p>“Beautiful Lady, do you want us to take you to hunt gene races?” A rough voice sounded from far away.</p>

<p>Han Sen was looking at Ji Yanran in the grassy pastures they occupied from afar. There was a group of Dragon race people approaching Ji Yanran. They were trying to talk to her.</p>

<p>Han Sen was not in a rush to go over to her. Ever since the year of Dollar began, humans and Space Garden had risen to become a powerful faction. Human women were quite popular in the universe. Many races were quite proud of the fact that they might have individuals marry human women.</p>

<p>Of course, many beautiful women from all different sorts of races wanted to marry human men too. Dragons and the humans had a good relationship. Seeing their faces, they did not seem to be malicious as they approached Ji Yanran.</p>

<p>“It is fine. I already have someone looking out for me,” Ji Yanran answered with a smile.</p>

<p>“Who? Who could be better than me, Dragon Two?” The young Dragon proudly patted himself on the chest.</p>

<p>“It’s that guy over there. I do not even know if I can beat him.” Ji Yanran pointed at Han Sen, who was chilling with Ling’er.</p>

<p>Dragon Two and the other Dragon people all looked in the same direction. When they saw Han Sen’s face, Dragon Two’s face changed. He shockingly shouted, “Han Sen!”</p>
