    <p>
      The injury on Han Sen&#8217;s chest had stopped bleeding. Although it was
      a decision he made at the moment he saw the spirit girl shifting into a
      warrior, Han Sen executed it perfectly with his peerless control of his
      body and timing.
    </p>

    <p>
      Although the slim silver sword pierced his body, Han Sen managed to avoid
      all his inner organs. It stabbed him in the gap between his heart and
      lung. In addition, his heart was the toughest among all inner organs
      because of the Heresy Mantra. It was probably even tougher than his
      muscles, which was why Han Sen dared to take such a great risk. It looked
      very scary, but the danger was not so great and the result was great.
    </p>

    <p>
      If it was a normal fight, the spirit might be guarded. Han Sen could not
      even be her match. Without any special tactics, it would be impossible for
      him to kill her so fast.
    </p>

    <p>
      Sneak attacks were focused on plots. Without any sacrifice, it would be
      impossible for someone weaker to beat someone stronger.
    </p>

    <p>
      After Han Sen killed the royal spirit, the army of creatures lost their
      leadership and became a mess. The evolvers of Starwheel Shelter roared in
      excitement, attacking proactively instead of defending themselves.
    </p>

    <p>
      Momentarily, the situation was completely reversed. The army of creatures
      was defeated, scattering around, while the evolvers started to chase the
      creatures falling behind.
    </p>

    <p>
      Disregarding his injury in the chest, Han Sen launched the strike at the
      sacred-blood gargoyle closest to him.
    </p>

    <p>
      The spirit could resurrect in spirit stone, so there was nothing left for
      Han Sen. If he could not take the opportunity to kill one or two
      sacred-blood creatures, he would be risking his life for no reason.
    </p>

    <p>
      Being attacked by Han Sen, the sacred-blood gargoyle did not manage to run
      away and had to fight him. Its stone-like hands continued to hit the
      ghost-pawed claws, while the claws were only able to leave shallow marks
      on the gargoyle&#8217;s skin.
    </p>

    <p>
      However, the blood flowing from those marks gradually turned purple and
      black. Ghost-pawed claws were extremely toxic, which almost defeated
      Jadeskin. Obviously, this gargoyle did not have any ability to cure
      toxins.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen became overjoyed. The toxins of the ferret stayed on its beast
      soul weapon, which would be extremely helpful for him to hunt sacred-blood
      creatures in the future. Poison was something very useful, but there were
      not that many beast souls with this feature.
    </p>

    <p>
      When Han Sen was feeling excited, the gargoyle raised its head and roared.
      Its stone-like skin suddenly contracted and turned into the color of
      steel, looking much tougher. Unexpectedly, it became a berserk creature.
    </p>

    <p>Clank clank clank!</p>

    <p>
      Han Sen made three strikes in a row and failed to cut gargoyle&#8217;s
      skin. The gargoyle did not linger and ran away immediately.
    </p>

    <p>
      It was not easy for Han Sen to have an opportunity to kill a sacred-blood
      creature, so there was no way he would let it go. Han Sen started to chase
      the gargoyle as fast as his legs would carry him.
    </p>

    <p>
      Without running too far, he saw the skin of the gargoyle showing a color
      of purple. Feeling excited, Han Sen knew that the gargoyle was not cured
      from the toxins earlier although it became berserk.
    </p>

    <p>
      Now Han Sen were even more driven to chase after the creature. This
      gargoyle was most likely doomed. Now the only thing Han Sen worried was
      that if it died of poison, its meat might not be edible anymore.
    </p>

    <p>
      However, Han Sen was not afraid of it either. As long as it did not affect
      the increase of geno points, he was fine with it.
    </p>

    <p>
      When the evolvers from the shelter came over, Han Sen had already run far,
      chasing the gargoyle. Except for Guan Tong, no one knew who Han Sen was.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Does everyone know who the friend killing the spirit was?&#8221;
      The creatures either run away or got killed. After everything was settled,
      Li Xinglun raised his voice and asked.
    </p>

    <p>
      Everyone in the crowd looked to each other, feeling confused. They also
      would like to know who that person was, saving Starwheel Shelter by
      killing the spirit alone. His bravery and power to behead the queen among
      thousands of creatures deeply impressed everyone.
    </p>

    <p>&#8220;Do we have such a strong man in Starwheel Shelter?&#8221;</p>

    <p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t think I have ever seen him.&#8221;</p>

    <p>&#8220;He seems so young.&#8221;</p>

    <p>&#8220;I want to bear his baby.&#8221;</p>

    <p>&#8220;…&#8221;</p>

    <p>
      Guan Tong flushed, failing to make a sound. She wanted to say that she
      knew Han Sen, but then she found that she did not even know what his name
      was or where he came from. Although she opened her mouth, she could not
      say a word.
    </p>

    <p>
      Seeing that no one knew the person, Li Xinglun did not hesitate to summon
      his mount, running in the direction where Han Sen went.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;I must meet such a great character, even just to learn his
      name.&#8221; Li Xinglun urged the horse to run fast. Fortunately, the
      footprints of the gargoyle were clearly imprinted on the way, pointing the
      right direction for him.
    </p>

    <p>
      After Han Sen chased the berserk gargoyle on the vast ice field for more
      than 300 miles, the berserk creature eventually lost its energy because of
      the poison. Han Sen went up and wielded his claws at it, beheading the
      creature after more than a hundred strikes.
    </p>

    <p>
      He only succeeded because the creature was too weak after being poisoned.
      Otherwise, even a sacred-blood weapon could not cut its skin which had
      turned so tough after it became berserk.
    </p>

    <blockquote>
      <p>
        &#8220;Berserk Sacred-Blood Creature Evil Gargoyle Killed. Beast Soul of
        Berserk Evil Gargoyle Gained. Meat Inedible.&#8221;
      </p>
    </blockquote>

    <p>
      The voice he heard almost made Han Sen laugh out of happiness. Lady luck
      was still on his side. After coming to Second God&#8217;s Sanctuary, he
      gained a beast soul from each of the three sacred-blood creatures he had
      killed. His luck was simply peerless.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Evil gargoyle, I wish it is armor. With a weapon and armor, I would
      not need to worry about anything.&#8221; Han Sen quickly looked to his sea
      of soul and saw the evil gargoyle squatting quietly.
    </p>

    <div class="tables">
      <table class="beast">
        <tr>
          <th colspan="2">Beast Soul Gained</th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Berserk Sacred-Blood Evil Gargoyle</td>
          <td>(Glyph)</td>
        </tr>
      </table>
      <!-- Type of beast soul of berserk sacred-blood evil gargoyle: glyph. -->
    </div>

    <p>
      &#8220;Another glyph!&#8221; After Han Sen saw it, he was dazed for a
      while. He still hadn&#8217;t figured out what was the use of the
      evil-blooded condor beast soul he gained last time. Unexpectedly, this
      sacred-blood evil gargoyle was also a glyph.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen summoned the evil gargoyle and a tattoo in the color of tungsten
      and shape of a ghost suddenly appeared on his body, looking gruesome.
      After the tattoo emerged, Han Sen saw that the skin all over his body
      gleamed like tungsten.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen summoned the ghost-pawed claws to cut at his own arm and heard
      clanks of metal on metal. His metal-like arm was only left with some white
      marks, not even broken.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Ha-ha, this is great… Fantastic…&#8221; After cutting a few times,
      Han Sen saw the result was the same, which made him feel overjoyed.
    </p>

    <p>
      This berserk evil gargoyle glyph was much better than the evil-blooded
      condor glyph the use of which was still unclear. This glyph was the
      equivalence of a terrific defense hyper geno art. Using this glyph, he
      could still use beast soul armor, which was quite amazing.
    </p>

    <p>
      Although Han Sen did not gain beast soul armor as he expected, he was even
      more pleased with the result.
    </p>

    <p>
      He took shelter from the wind and took out the ghost-pawed ferret in his
      backpack. He carefully boned and skinned ferret, cleaned it with snow,
      sliced the tender meat, dipped it in sauce, and put it into his mouth.
    </p>

    <p>
      He was on a vast ice field where not even grass could be spotted, so
      naturally there was no way to make a fire.
