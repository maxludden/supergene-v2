Little Angel didn’t change much. She still had that white cape, and her hair looked tidy. The angel wings on her back and the halo on her head didn’t show up under non-fighting mode. Her face was so pure that it seemed she was actually from heaven.

However, Han Sen knew that this was only the ordinary status of the angel. Her combat mode was totally different.

The Golden Growler stood on the other side, and it seemed very small. It looked like a golden retriever, and its hair was a bit curly. It didn’t look ferocious at all; instead, it looked very cute.

Han Sen looked at the two pets that didn’t seem to have any fighting power at all, and he was very hesitant. He was worried that they might have developed incorrectly.

Or were they only at bronze level when they were born? Maybe they needed to upgrade themselves like creatures. Somewhat worried, Han Sen quickly went to check Little Angel’s description.

<div class="tables">
	<table class="beast">
		<tr>
			<th colspan="2">Beast Soul</th>
		</tr><tr>
			<td>Super Archangel</td>
			<td>(Pet)</td>
		</tr><tr>
			<th class="note" colspan="2">Note: Evolved to Fighting Status (Evolve and Merge)</th>
	</table>
	<!-- Super beast soul: Pet type. Evolved to fighting status (Evolve and merge).-->
</div> 

Han Sen relieved now. She was still super class, and nothing had changed about her. She still had all her abilities, and she could still evolve.

Han Sen took a look at Golden Growler’s description, and he wasn’t as anxious as before.

<div class="tables">
	<table class="beast">
		<tr>
			<th colspan="2">Beast Soul</th>
		</tr><tr>
			<td>Super Golden Growler</td>
			<td>(Mount)</td>
		</tr><tr>
			<th class="note" colspan="2">Note: Evolved and Psychic</th>
	</table>
	<!-- Super beast soul Golden Growler: Mount-type (Evolve and psychic).-->
</div> 

Han Sen was dazed, and he didn’t know what psychic meant. Golden Growler’s description had never contained that information before.

Now that Han Sen had summoned Golden Growler and Little Angel, he needed to study them more thoroughly. Han Sen wanted to ascertain the extent of their real power.

He first let Little Angel enter combat mode, and he watched as her small form was soaked in holy light. She became a golden beauty in holy armor, and a halo and angel wings also appeared. She emanated a holy light as she held the handle of a large sword, and her entire body was holy and solemn.

Now that she was giving off a powerful light, she looked like a goddess. The strong, pure power coming out of her body amazed Han Sen.

“Little Angel… Combine…” Han Sen ordered the Little Angel. Little Angel walked to Han Sen and took Han Sen’s face in her hands. After a gentle kiss, her body turned into holy light and rushed into Han Sen.

Han Sen felt that his entire body was filled with warm energy. He couldn’t help bellowing, and the power coming out of him turned into holy armor, the wings of an angel, and an angel halo. The giant angel sword also appeared in his hands.

The pure energy made Han Sen feel that he was stronger than ever. Even when he was merging with Fallen Slaughter, he didn’t feel such power. Even more incredible, the power flooded into Han Sen’s geno cores and improved all four of them to super level.

Which immediately concerned Han Sen. He hadn’t strengthened his geno cores nine times yet, so this evolvement would not be perfect.

After he separated himself from Little Angel, his geno cores dropped back to their normal levels. Han Sen breathed out a sigh of relief.

“The power of the Little Angel can actually strengthen my geno cores. Even though the angel power is a little different from the normal strength that the cores possess, it still means that I have four super geno cores now.” Han Sen was joyful.

He had so many Life Geno Essences, and he had the Little Angel now. After he refined the Life Geno Essences, he would be able to roam the Fourth God’s Sanctuary, and he wouldn’t need to rely on the Fallen Slaughter body anymore.

When he tested Golden Growler’s power, he found that the pet’s size-shifting ability had strengthened. When it was the smallest, it was the size of a cell, and when it was the largest, it was as large as a spaceship at star level.

As far as what the description meant by “psychic,” Han Sen still had no idea.

He had intended to go to Planet Tariq, but now that he had obtained so much, Han Sen decided to slow down a bit. He wanted to go to Tarik Star after he refined all his Life Geno Essences.

The New Community was still an unknown quantity. In addition to the demigods and shura they controlled in the universe at large, they were also able to summon so many super creatures in the Sanctuary. It was disturbing.

“Is it possible that the Chairman of the New Community is actually the God that Han Jinzhi met?” Han Sen wondered.

Qing Ya and Tina arrived back in the New Community, and they were immediately called to the meeting room.

“I’m sorry, Chairman. Our task failed again. Han Sen is much more powerful than we expected, and he also has two very powerful helpers. Gu Qingcheng killed Sha Lanjia, and we also lost most of our super creatures and shura warriors,” said Qing Ya to the Chairman of the New Community. As for Tina, she had her head lowered without saying anything.

The Chairman said mildly, “I’m aware. Tell me something I don’t know.”

“It seems that we don’t have the power to kill Han Sen, either in the Alliance or in the Sanctuaries, but I have something that might help us deal with this problem,” said Qing Ya.

“Oh? Do tell.” The Chairman looked at Qing Ya, interested.

Qing Ya stopped for a second and continued, “It’s impossible for us to kill Han Sen, but we can start with his family first.”

“Do you think he’s the type of person who will risk his life for his family?” asked the Chairman of the New Community, looking at Qing Ya.

“It’s worth a try,” said Qing Ya.

“You’re right.” The Chairman looked at Tina and said, “Tina, go get some rest.”

“Yes, Father,” answered Tina. She quickly stepped out, and she made a face at Qing Ya before she left.

Qing Ya was surprised when the Chairman told him to stay. There must be something else that the Chairman needed, but Qing Ya had no idea what it would be.

“Who is the closest to Han Sen?” asked the Chairman.

“He has a mother, a wife, and a son. As for the other relatives, they’re not that close to him. His mother is a descendant of Luo Haitang, so it won’t be easy to attack her. His wife is from the Ji family, but she isn’t living with the Ji’s now. I think it will be easier to get his wife and son,” said Qing Ya after thinking.

“You’re right, but I think there’s someone who’s closer and easier to find,” the Chairman said mildly.

“I’m sorry, I don’t know who you’re talking about.” Qing Ya looked confused, but he still spoke calmly.

The Chairman looked at Qing Ya and smiled. He then said, “He has a father, right?”

“Based on my knowledge, his father died in an accident a long time ago,” said Qing Ya with his head lowered.

“No, he’s still alive,” said the Chairman of the New Community.
