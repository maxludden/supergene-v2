<p>“Why is that?” Xie Qing King glanced at Dia Robber with a raised
eyebrow.</p>
<p>“Since the battle powers of the Flower Gods are extremely low,
they focus their efforts on protecting their Space Garden. In all
the time that their race has lived here, very few outsiders have
ever been able to access the Space Garden. Now it seems like
they’re letting everyone in. Don’t you think that is a little
suspicious?” Dia Robber said as he sat down.</p>
<p>“It really is quite suspicious. Do you know anything about what
is going on?” Xie Qing King asked with some curiosity.</p>
<p>Dia Robber shook his head. “Not really. But from what I have
experienced in the past, I am inclined to believe that this will be
a very dangerous trip. Teacher Xie, you are a man of great
knowledge. There is no need for you to risk your life.”</p>
<p>“It is fine. It is fine. There are some places I wouldn’t dare
to go, but with him protecting me, going to the Flower Gods should
be okay,” Xie Qing King said, tipping a thumb toward Han Sen.</p>
<p>Dia Robber could see the confidence Xie Qing King had in his
guard, and so he looked at Han Sen and asked, “I have never
formally met you before. Who are you?”</p>
<p>“This is my bodyguard, San Mu. He is such a skilled fighter that
he can battle two or three deifieds at once.” Xie Qing King was
bluffing and hyping Han Sen up already.</p>
<p>“San Mu, if you have earned the admiration of Teacher Xie, you
must be a very powerful person. I wonder where you are from,
Brother San Mu.” Dia Robber didn’t use a geno art to analyze Han
Sen, but he noticed that he couldn’t feel or discern Han Sen’s
presence. That surprised him.</p>
<p>“I’m just from a nameless race. You wouldn’t know them, so it
wouldn’t matter even if I told you,” Han Sen muttered, his voice
dismissive and short.</p>
<p>Xie Qing King looked at Dia Robber and laughed. “Don’t worry
about it. He has a bad temper. He’s always like that, I’m afraid.
Even to his boss. There is nothing that can be done about it.”</p>
<p>“It’s fine. People with power can get away with more than most.
Just like Teacher Xie said: if Brother San Mu can beat three
enemies at once, then it’s understandable even if he is a little
abrupt.” Dia Robber let out a slight chuckle.</p>
<p>“Even though you say he is good, I think he is just good at
bluffing and being a d*ck,” said a provocative voice behind
them.</p>
<p>The three of them looked over to its source, and they found that
the voice had come from another table. There were two Extreme
Kings, one of whom was the crown prince, Bai Wanjie.</p>
<p>The other person was a young girl. She had a very intriguing and
powerful presence, but judging from her age, there was no way she
could have been deified already. She was the one who had
spoken.</p>
<p>Han Sen and the other two at his table had experienced a lot in
their lives. Unlike ordinary young people, they weren’t easily
riled. They weren’t going to argue with a little girl. They just
pretended not to hear her and resumed talking.</p>
<p>The little girl, upon seeing that her declaration received no
response from Han Sen, grew bored with the thought of taunting them
further. She stopped trying to rile others up.</p>
<p>Because Violet had needed to cram everyone into a small
battleship, there were a lot of deifieds in one place. It was only
natural that arguments might arise. Fortunately, everyone had
assembled there for a singular purpose. Until they reached the
Space Garden, no all-out fights would break out.</p>
<p>Han Sen tried to memorize the route to the Space Garden, so he
could recall how to get back there if he ever needed to.</p>
<p>But the battleship was moving too quickly. After a few space
jumps, Han Sen lost track of where he was.</p>
<p>Once they entered the xenogeneic space of the Flower Gods, Han
Sen finally understood why the place was called the Space Garden.
What Han Sen saw was blankets of flowers covering sprawling
meadows.</p>
<p>The flower fields looked like stairs rising between the clouds.
There were loads of weird flowers scattered everywhere that Han Sen
looked. All of them were xenogeneic plants of various levels. It
was unbelievably pretty.</p>
<p>The ship parked next to the flower fields, and then, Violet
brought them down.</p>
<p>After they left the battleship, Han Sen smelled the scent of all
those flowers. While the fragrance was very strong, it wasn’t
cloying or overbearing. It had a natural tinge to it.</p>
<p>“Is this a canna lily?” Dia Robber asked suddenly, looking at a
particular flower.</p>
<p>Han Sen and Xie Qing King followed Dia Robber’s gaze. There was
a flowery vine that was half a meter long. A few flowers had
sprouted from the vine, and each bloom looked like a little girl
practicing ballet. They looked very pretty.</p>
<p>“Yes. That is a canna lily. You have a good pair of eyes.”
Violet gave Dia Robber a thumbs up.</p>
<p>But Dia Robber didn’t seem to be happy about his discovery. In
fact, he looked rather glum.</p>
<p>After everyone’s focus turned away from Dia Robber to move
forward, Han Sen walked over to Dia Robber’s side and asked, “What
is it?”</p>
<p>Dia Robber frowned and said, “From what I can tell, canna lilies
should be deified plants. They grow in very unique environments,
and their powers are never weaker than a primitive deified
xenogeneic. The Flower Gods just grow them randomly on the side of
the road. Isn’t that a little too strange?”</p>
<p>“It is surprising to learn that the Flower Gods can grow deified
plants with such ease,” Xie Qing King said with a frown.</p>
<p>Violet kept moving. Han Sen and the others walked past countless
flowers and fields of grass. There were so many varieties of
plants, and Han Sen could only recognize a tiny fraction of them.
But judging from the lifeforce of the grasses and flowers, he could
feel that they were nothing ordinary. They were all xenogeneic
plants.</p>
<p>“None of these plants are ordinary. No wonder the Flower Gods
can create so many geno fluids.” Han Sen kept looking around him.
He didn’t know what most of the plants were called, but he could
tell from their lifeforce that they were some good stuff.</p>
<p>“This is such a nice place. If we can take over this territory,
we would never have to worry about resources. The xenogeneic plant
resources here could feed 100,000 people,” Xie Qing King murmured
to Han Sen.</p>
<p>Han Sen was thinking about something else, though. He ignored
Xie Qing King.</p>
<p>“Xenogeneic plants bear fruit from time to time. As long as the
seeds inside a fruit are not damaged, I can take them to the land
of the fire phoenix to grow. I don’t know how much that would
reduce their growing time, though.” Han Sen couldn’t imagine how
much he would gain if he could accelerate the growth of plants like
this. If he brought a few seeds to the extreme living land, he
could reap enormous quantities of xenogeneic fruit in a short
amount of time. Then, he would most certainly become rich.</p>
<p>“We are nearing the place where the incident happened. Please be
careful.” Violet’s footsteps slowed.</p>
<p>“Don’t we need to meet the leader of your race first?” Dragon
One asked with suspicion.</p>
<p>“The leader and the others are already there,” Violet said. He
kept walking as he talked, so no one slowed down and they all
continued following.</p>
