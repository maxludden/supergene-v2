<h2>Cast God Court</h2>
<h3>Chapter 3103</h3>

<p>At long last, he had had the chance to see the complete gold
lightning mark. He now knew the lightning’s language was Cast God
Court.</p>
<p>When he looked further down, Han Sen felt rather strange. The
Cast God Court detailed how to create a god. It was not about
turning oneself into a God Spirit. It was about turning a gene race
into a God Spirit.</p>
<p>A gene race had three different stages of growth. They were
defined as a juvenile, adult, or ultimate mode. Ordinary gene races
would typically become adults, but only the most talented and best
of the best could become ultimate. Their power enabled them to cast
out unimaginably scary powers.</p>
<p>If gene races wanted to grow up, they had to consume a lot of
gene-race flesh. It was the only way to nurture their growth.</p>
<p>It did not matter if it was a god-class gene race or an ordinary
gene race like a viscount. Their biggest aspirations were to reach
the ultimate stage. There was nothing beyond that achievement.</p>
<p>Even the very rare big sky demon gene race was only able to
reach ultimate mode. That was where the evolution of every gene
race came to an end.</p>
<p>This Cast God Court skill was able to make an ultimate-mode gene
race ascend one more tier. It allowed a gene race to enter super
mode to create a God Spirit body.</p>
<p>If Han Sen was able to make his gene race become ultimate, they
could become a God Spirit. That meant he could potentially lead an
array of God Spirits and even combine with the God Spirit bodies.
That type of battle power was almost unfathomable to imagine.</p>
<p>According to the text, making a gene race become a God Spirit
was not easy, though. It required god-pulse support.</p>
<p>The so-called god pulse was the blood dragon god pulse Han Sen
already had. It was a born universe life pulse god power. That
meant it was a God Spirit’s original power.</p>
<p>With a god pulse, a god pulse element that matched the gene race
was also necessary. It was only then that a gene race could get
help from the god pulse to aid its evolution. That was when it
would become a God Spirit that was above average.</p>
<p>Even if one had a god pulse and an exclusive gene race, the
success rate was still low. Not all gene races could become a God
Spirit with ease.</p>
<p>Han Sen thought that part was interesting, but it did not tempt
him too much. He already had a God Spirit but becoming a God Spirit
was something the world was restricting him from doing. He could
not summon it in the universe of kingdoms.</p>
<p>The content at the end of the Cast God Court made Han Sen open
his eyes wide.</p>
<p>The true goal of Cast God Court was not just to make a God
Spirit. It was to use a God Spirit’s combination power to break a
barrier in space and enter the place where a sky full of worlds
with reincarnation were unbound by the rules of the world and set
free from the bindings of life and death. They were able to freely
enter the reincarnation and sky full of worlds.</p>
<p>“If I can reach that level, I can just break the space barrier
and return to the universe,” Han Sen happily thought. The more he
looked at the writing, the more Han Sen’s face turned dire.</p>
<p>According to what the text said, to reach that level, one had to
forge a Reboot-class God Spirit and combine with it.</p>
<p>The rest of the gold lightning marks revealed a few cases of
higher success rates with gene race evolutions. There was Ten
Direction Sky World God King and Sky Full of Big Lust Demon
God.</p>
<p>In short, Ten Direction Sky World God King was World King God.
According to legend, it was one of the rare gene races Qin Xiu
had.</p>
<p>The Sky Full of Big Lust Demon God, in short, was big sky demon.
It was the gene race with which he had established a strange
connection.</p>
<p>They all had a chance to become Reboot-class demon spirits. They
were very rare gene races. Even if they did not become God Spirits,
if they at least reached ultimate mode, their power was enough to
fight God Spirits. They were naturally very powerful.</p>
<p>There were only five gene races like that in the Cast God Court.
Han Sen hadn’t heard of the other three before.</p>
<p>There were also records about gene races being able to have a
chance of reaching that level, but the gene races with a low
potential had a lesser chance.</p>
<p>Even the chances of World King God and big sky demon succeeding
was around 20 to 30%. The chances of other gene races were too low
to imagine. “I can’t believe big sky demon’s rank is that high. It
can be at the same level as Qin Xiu’s World God King.” This greatly
surprised Han Sen.</p>
<p>He already knew big sky demon was strong, but he did not suspect
she was that strong.</p>
<p>Han Sen wondered if the person stirring up a big storm in the
geno universe was World King God under Qin Xiu’s control. It might
have even been Qin Xiu himself.</p>
<p>Otherwise, that was the only way Qin Xiu’s blood being blue
could be explained. The blood of the humans in the universe of
kingdoms was red, so Qin Xiu’s had to be the same. But World King
God’s blood was blue.</p>
<p>“Big sky demon takes the stone ocarina seriously. Does that mean
she wants to use the Cast God Court to make a God Spirit body?” Han
Sen wondered.</p>
<p>After Feng Yin Yin finished playing the song, she realized the
clouds and lightning above her head. She was shocked and said, “San
Mu, this stone ocarina is weird. Why does it summon flowers and
lightning?”.</p>
<p>Han Sen pulled Feng Yin Yin closer and said, “Little Yin Yin,
the stone ocarina and the flower lightning is our secret. Can you
please not tell anyone about this?”</p>
<p>“Not even Auntie?” Feng Yin Yin asked.</p>
<p>Han Sen seriously replied, “Yeah. Nobody. Only you and I can
know.”</p>
<p>“OK. This will be a secret between you and me only. I will not
tell anyone.” Feng Yin Yin reached out her finger and smiled.
“Let’s make a pinkie promise.”</p>
<p>“OK. Pinkie promise.” Han Sen hooked his pinkie finger with the
finger Feng Yin Yin was extending. Their fingers touched each
other. After discovering Cast God Court, Han Sen had hope. Although
he knew it would not be easy, there was a chance.</p>
<p>The five gene races in the information provided were creatures
Han Sen could not claim yet. With big sky demon next to him, there
was little he could do about it. He did not know where the real
body of big sky demon resided.</p>
<p>Han Sen thought, “Although I do not have an ultimate gene race,
a mutant god-class gene race’s success rate for becoming a God
Spirit is just a bit lower than an ultimate gene race. I have the
blood ghost spirit and gold wing peacock king. I can try them, but
where can I find a god pulse that suits them? The only thing that
matches is the blood god dragon and blood dragon god pulse. But the
blood god dragon is in baby form. I need to make it an adult so it
can have a chance of combining with the blood dragon god pulse.
Making a God Spirit body will not be that easy.”</p>
<p>Thinking of that, Han Sen looked into his Sea of Soul. He
examined the gold wing peacock king. It was still in egg mode. Its
evolution had not finished.</p>
<p>“Feeding it myself is too slow. I do not have that much
gene-race meat to use. It looks like the gold winged peacock king
has to finish evolving first and use the black crystal armor to
make the blood god dragon increase.” Han Sen made up his mind, but
he had no idea when the gold wing peacock king would finish
evolving.</p>
<p>While Han Sen was thinking about that, he suddenly heard a noise
outside. He stood up and looked out the window. He saw many people
wearing uniforms surrounding Feng Fei Fei’s castle.</p>
