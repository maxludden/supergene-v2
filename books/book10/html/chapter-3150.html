<p>“Han Sen, you have a daughter that old!” Qin Bai looked at
Bao’er with shock.</p>
<p>Qin Bai wasn’t in the mood to concern himself with that. He
quickly asked, “Han Sen, do you have a method or not? Tell me
quickly.”</p>
<p>Han Sen smiled and said, “My method is simple. My daughter has
already learned some sword skills from me. Just have her practice
with you.”</p>
<p>Qin Bai’s eyes opened wide at Han Sen. He said, “Han Sen, you
must be joking. Your daughter is so little. How can she know any
sword skills? Even if she did, she could not beat my guards. If I
wanted just anyone to help me practice, I could ask the people all
around me. I don’t need a little girl to practice sword skills with
me.”</p>
<p>Han Sen smiled mysteriously. “There is no need to be hasty,
Crown Prince. My daughter’s sword skills are average, but there is
something miraculous about her. She enables anyone who practices
with her to improve their sword skills in a short amount of
time.”</p>
<p>Qin Bai did not believe it. He looked at Bao’er and asked,
“Really?”</p>
<p>Han Sen sincerely said, “You have been nice to me. Why would I
lie to you? My daughter is talented. In fact, practicing is not the
most important thing. You only need to spend some time with her,
and your sword skills will be vastly improved in just a few short
days. You can practice that Wavy Sword Skill with ease.”</p>
<p>“If it is like that, then let’s begin.” Qin Bai had some doubts,
but he accepted.</p>
<p>Han Sen shook his head. “Mister Crown Prince, this is the
palace. If you guys play here, it is not very appropriate.”</p>
<p>“Yes, yes, yes,” Bai Qin said with a nod. “We cannot let Teacher
Jia see this. Let’s go to your place.” He was now looking quite
excited.</p>
<p>“That’s good. I have been living in Feng Castle. You should come
with me.” Han Sen smiled at Qin Bai and left the palace. They went
straight to Feng Castle.</p>
<p>Han Sen and the others were still living in Feng Castle. The
primary reason was that Han Sen wanted to frequently see Feng Yin
Yin. If he didn’t, Han Sen would have already moved out.</p>
<p>“Wait, it’s been so long since I last watched a concert,” Qin
Bai said with a nod. “I will ask Feng Fei Fei to sing a few songs
for us.”</p>
<p>Han Sen took Qin Bai to Feng Castle, but Feng Fei Fei was not
home. Feng Yin Yin said she was out performing and would not be
back for a while.</p>
<p>“It is good that she is not here.” Qin Bai was disappointed, but
Han Sen was happy about it.</p>
<p>“Please follow me,” Han Sen said as he went to the garden.</p>
<p>The garden looked like a garden, but it was the best yard in
Feng Castle. Feng Fei Fei had people create it for Han Sen. The
place made him feel very happy. He loved the little garden, The
design was exceptional. “Crown Prince, you stay here and be with
Bao’er,” Han Sen said. “I have stuff to do, so I will have to go
for a bit.”</p>
<p>“Go do your thing,” Qin Bai said. “I will watch after Bao’er. We
will be fine.</p>
<p>Han Sen did not say anything. He smiled and went back to his
room.</p>
<p>Although Han Sen was not someone who used a sword, his sword
skills were fairly high-level. He was not as good as the truly
strong swordmasters. Only rare powerful swordsmen, such as Six
Paths King, were a bit stronger than Han Sen on a sword path will.
Teaching Qin Bai the Wavy Sword Skill was going to be easy. Even
so, Han Sen understood Qin Bai quite a bit. He was a person who was
always fooling around. He was a bona fide spoiled brat.</p>
<p>It was normal to have a kid like that in any ordinary family,
but he was born to a royal family. Furthermore, he was the only
successor to the kingdom’s throne. A royal son wanting to play all
the time was seen as much worse.</p>
<p>With Qin Bai’s personality, if he had been born in a normal
family, he would have been happier.</p>
<p>But that was fate. People could not change that. Han Sen knew
that if he taught him sword skills seriously, he would only end up
being bored after a short while. If he did not practice, and Han
Sen could not beat him, it would have been a futile endeavor.</p>
<p>It was best left to Bao’er to sort out a problematic child.</p>
<p>In the garden, Bao’er and Qin Bai spoke happily with each other.
Han Sen thought, “You asked for this.”</p>
<p>Han Sen shut the door and summoned the Sky King Crown. He tried
using the Sky King Crown to return to the God of Wealth Temple. He
was able to use it in the geno universe, but he did not know if it
worked there.</p>
<p>Fortunately, the Sky King Crown was still usable there. After
God took away the prior restrictions of the universe of kingdoms,
Sky King Crown had now become usable.</p>
<p>Han Sen wanted God to remove the restrictions of all his god
personality armaments, but he had not yet seen him again.</p>
<p>Han Sen stood atop the altar. He felt the Sky God Crown’s power
connecting with the god temple. The god temple was like a tree with
deep roots. With a touch of the roots, Han Sen wore the Sky King
Crown to feel what was happening in the God of Wealth River from a
few hundred thousand miles away.</p>
<p>If the God of Wealth River led underground, the Sky God Crown’s
sensing power did not work. It was blocked by something.</p>
<p>“What lies beneath the underground river?” Han Sen wanted to
find out, but the underground river was at least 10,000 miles long.
There were no coordinates either. It was going to be hard to
find.</p>
<p>While Han Sen was thinking, he suddenly felt something. His mind
jumped. His brain pictured something.</p>
<p>He saw a woman holding a child rushing to the God of Wealth’s
area. A few people were chasing her.</p>
<p>The person behind her shouted, “Woman, stop running! That child
is bad luck! He will harm you and hurt Big Brother!” He did not
relent in his pursuit.</p>
<p>The woman did not speak. She ran for her life.</p>
<p>From the look on the woman’s face, Han Sen knew that she was
dying. She was using all her will to support her flight.</p>
<p>Just as she got next to the river, the people in pursuit caught
up with the woman holding the child.</p>
<p>“Lady, why are you doing this for an unlucky person? Look at
what has become of you! Is this really what you want?” One of the
people sighed as he spoke to the woman.</p>
<p>“Please, I beg you. Just let us live.” The woman, holding the
child, kneeled and kowtowed before the person.</p>
<p>“Lady, it is not like we want to kill you, but this child really
is harmful to Big Brother. If he does not die, Big Brother will not
get well. You are his wife. You do not want to see something bad
happen to him, do you?” The person gave a signal, which led to the
others close in on her.</p>
<p>“This is our son. Is he really that cruel?” The woman clutched
the child while crying.</p>
<p>Han Sen thought this was a strange scene. “Has something like
this really happened in this place of all places? For the most
part, the whole planet is controlled by Sky King. Is this woman
related to Sky King?” Han Sen’s heart jumped. He looked at the
child in the woman’s arms. He was shocked.</p>
<p>The child was two or three years old. It was in the woman’s
arms. Its eyes were open, but it did not cry or shout.</p>
<p>That was not the problem. It was the child’s face. It looked
very cute and pink, but it was bald. Its head displayed nine
different lumps. It sort of looked like a buddha.</p>
<p>Han Sen thought the child looked very familiar. He thought about
it for a while and noticed it looked like someone. “No way… This
child… Is he the reborn Burning Lamp, the alpha of the Buddha?”</p>
