<h2>Killing Purgatory Beasts</h2>
<h3>Chapter 1879</h3>

<p>On the aircraft, Guna was able to witness the changes
transpiring outside the window. She screamed, “Guya activated
Purgatory Heaven?”</p>
<p>“What is Purgatory Heaven?” Wang Yuhang asked Guna.</p>
<p>When Han Sen left, Wang Yuhang, Han Meng’er, and Lady Chef were
tasked with watching Guna, in case she got up to any mischief
during his absence.</p>
<p>Guna gave a wry smile, and she shook her head. “It looks as if
the Gana cannot be saved, after all. It is good, I suppose, that we
all die here. No one shall live now.”</p>
<p>As Guna was speaking, a noise came from outside.</p>
<p>Wang Yuhang wanted to take a look at what was going on, but
before he reached the door, an arm shot up from the floor. It
shocked Wang Yuhang, and he quickly leaped up on the nearest
table.</p>
<p>“What the hell is that?” Wang Yuhang could see that those same
arms were starting to pop up all across the floor. Only the bed was
devoid of hands, so he jumped over to it for safety.</p>
<p>Han Meng’er and Lady Chef went to the bed, as well. Lady Chef
drew out her cleaver and tried to hack the hands. But it wasn’t
long before one of her hands was grabbed.</p>
<p>Luckily, Lady Chef was able to pull back quickly. If she hadn’t,
she’d have been pulled forward and been a goner.</p>
<p>“What was that? Please don’t tell me you don’t know,” Wang
Yuhang asked Guna.</p>
<p>Guna, looking all cocky, said, “Have you heard of the deified
item of the Guna? It’s Purgatory Heaven.”</p>
<p>“No, I haven’t.” Wang Yuhang and the others were confused. They
had just arrived there, after all, so it was extremely unlikely
they’d know about it.</p>
<p>Guna rolled her eyes and said, “Ignorance! How can you guys know
nothing about our famous deified item? Anyway… That item has been
activated. So, we are now all going to die.”</p>
<p>Wang Yuhang smiled and said, “I don’t think so. If it is an item
of your race, there must be a way for you to deal with it.” “No.”
Guna shook her head.</p>
<p>“If you don’t have a way, then why are the arms unable to close
in on your proximity?” Wang Yuhang did not believe what Guna was
telling him, and so he gave her a smug smile.</p>
<p>Guna rolled her eyes and said, “I have the blood of the Gana
Goddess. So, I can hold them off for a little while. It’s not very
effective, though. Purgatory Heaven has just started, so this
benefits me a little. When the Purgatory Beasts come, however, I
can assure you it’ll be useless.”</p>
<p>“What Purgatory Beasts?” Wang Yuhang asked.</p>
<p>Guna didn’t bother answering, and then, they heard a growling
noise inside the room. When the growl came, Guna’s face changed,
and her radiance increased to light up the room with a warmer
glow.</p>
<p>A black beast with two heads crawled out of the ground. The
ship’s floor was no longer alloy. It was like mud.</p>
<p>Now, she no longer needed to explain what a Purgatory Beast
was.</p>
<p>Dragon Lady summoned a big fork. Holding it, she drove it
forward to strike the beast.</p>
<p>The fork went right through its body, and it was as if she was
trying to fork a shadow. The beast was still coming.</p>
<p>“It’s useless. The Purgatory Beast has been generated by a
deified item. It is still early, so they are relatively weak right
now. But even so, they have deified powers. Ordinary powers won’t
hurt them in the least.”</p>
<p>Before Guna finished speaking, a black arrow went flying into
the beast’s head. The beast squealed as the arrow pierced the
phantom flesh of the body. The power was so strong, the creature
was pinned to the ground and exploded. The beast’s pieces then
dissolved into black smoke.</p>
<p>Guna’s eyes opened wide, and she looked at the black-clothed
lady. She tried moving her lips to speak, but words could not
come.</p>
<p>Han Meng’er had oh-so-simply killed a Purgatory Beast. And it
wasn’t long before another appeared. Han Meng’er drew a black arrow
and blew up the head of the next Purgatory Beast that revealed
itself.</p>
<p>“What is up with this woman? She is just a Baron! How could she
kill a Purgatory Beast? Although these Purgatory Beasts are weak,
it should still take a King class elite to kill one. They are born
from the powers of a deified item.” Guna was flabbergasted,
watching Han Meng’er slay the Purgatory Beasts with arrows.</p>
<p>No beast was able to show up in the room for long, as each one
was killed by Han Meng’er.</p>
<p>“No wonder she is called Death Goddess! Only Han Sen can compete
with her.” Wang Yuhang spoke fondly, after seeing the Purgatory
Beasts get killed so quickly. He gave her a big thumbs-up, too.</p>
<p>Out on the streets, Han Sen, Icebird Duke, and the Gana Holy
Lady were surrounded by a legion of Purgatory Beasts. Icebird
Duke’s body was brimming with an icy power, and she cast her scary
icebird to try to freeze all the beasts.</p>
<p>But the icy birds went right through the bodies of the beasts
and didn’t hurt them at all.</p>
<p>It wasn’t because her ice birds weren’t powerful; the Purgatory
Beasts were simply too high-level. No one without special powers
could damage them.</p>
<p>Apparently, Icebird Duke was not capable of doing this. She
couldn’t restrict the Purgatory Beasts.</p>
<p>Han Sen brought out his Ghost Teeth Knife. He tried attacking
one of the creatures that drew near, but even the Ghost Teeth Knife
was slicing clean through without hurting the foe.</p>
<p>Teeth power was useless against Purgatory Beasts. Unless Ghost
Teeth Knife had been activated to its fullest, like when he was in
the Raven palace, it was a useless tool to wield.</p>
<p>The knife had only been activated back then because the sun
raven was too powerful. These Purgatory Beasts weren’t that
powerful, and they simply smelled like death. And because of this,
the true strength of Ghost Teeth Knife could not activate.</p>
<p>The Holy Lady Guya kept swinging her hands. She cast blood to
attack and end the beasts, but she could not do this for that long.
There was a limit to how much blood she could part with. She
couldn’t deal with them all.</p>
<p>Guya knew a lot about death, so she wasn’t upset about the
prospect of dying. What did make her sad, though, was not being
able to see Guna one last time.</p>
<p>Han Sen gathered up some power of his own. He used the godlight
from Jadeskin, which was at Viscount class, but it still wasn’t
enough to work on the beasts.</p>
<p>As Han Sen frowned and fell into thought, he heard the sound of
a gunshot. A white armored person with two revolvers appeared,
repeatedly pulling at the triggers.</p>
<p>Each bullet came out to strike a Purgatory Beast, transforming
each and every one into a puff of black smoke.</p>
