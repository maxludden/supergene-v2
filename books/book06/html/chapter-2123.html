<h2>Small Bug Power</h2>
<h3>Chapter 2123</h3>

<p>The next set of bouts in the Geno Being Scroll was underway.
When Han Sen was transported into his next battleground, he found
himself standing in a forest that was tangled with a copious number
of trees.</p>
<p>Across the entire universe, many different races tuned it to
spectate Han Sen’s fight. Han Sen’s contest was now receiving more
attention than the fight of any King.</p>
<p>“Hm, it appears that Dollar’s next opponent is Kun of the
Pirate. The Pirates are fairly mysterious, aren’t they? They have
many elites and their powers are, for lack of a better word,
strange. I am really hoping Kun is going to cause him trouble. She
needs to put him in a sticky spot that will prompt him to use
Dollar again, so that we can get a better look at it.” Clear Sea
King was currently speaking with King Rosa.</p>
<p>Clear Sea King and King Rosa had been sent there to investigate
the enigmatic Dollar’s ability widely dubbed Dollar. Even though
they weren’t very interested in watching Marquises fight, they were
looking forward to seeing Han Sen’s performance.</p>
<p>King Rosa nodded and said, “Dollar is indeed strong, but Pirates
don’t put up with weak, middle-of-the-road characters amongst their
ranks, either. Perhaps we will be able to find out something
through this fight. Even if we are unable to, later, when Dollar
faces off against Lone Bamboo, we are guaranteed to see it again.
It’s all just a matter of time.”</p>
<p>Clear Sea King and King Rosa weren’t the only ones trying to
research Han Sen. Even Sky Path Garden of Sky Palace had tasked a
whole bunch of researchers to observe Han Sen’s fight in the hope
of seeing Dollar again.</p>
<p>Han Sen looked around, but all he could see amidst that forest
was trees. He couldn’t see his enemy lurking anywhere nearby. Han
Sen frowned and took off into the air. He wanted to fly above the
trees of the forest and see if he could spot his enemy from the
air.</p>
<p>But when his body lifted off of the ground, he saw a swarm of
bugs begin filtering down from the top of the trees. They were all
very small like flies, and they flew quickly. Like a black cloud,
they came forward to try to cloak Han Sen.</p>
<p>Han Sen swiftly tapped into his Dongxuan Sutra’s simulation
abilities and attuned his powers to fire. He threw a punch towards
the bugs once he was set, which sent a comet of fire soaring
through the swarm.</p>
<p>The cloud of insects was charred into ash, and not a single one
of the critters was left alive.</p>
<p>You are good! Realizing that bugs are afraid of fire means you
are smart, and on top of that, you have the ability to wield fire,
too.” A woman’s voice sounded from someplace amidst the forest, but
Han Sen still couldn’t see her. It was as if her voice was coming
from all directions at once.</p>
<p>“Why are you hiding? Come on out and fight me. These petty
little tricks won’t work on me,” Han Sen said calmly.</p>
<p>The woman’s voice sounded once more, but this time, it was
mocking. “Tricks? Well, you might like this next trick. Let’s give
it a try, shall we?”</p>
<p>As soon as she stopped speaking, another swarm of bugs came
crawling out of a tree. So thick were their numbers, it was like a
black fog headed right for Han Sen.</p>
<p>Han Sen wreathed himself in fire. As the flames torched every
bug in his proximity, Han Sen moved to one of the trees and punched
it with all his might. That tree was hollow on the inside.
Something had been hiding within, but whatever it was, it was gone
now.</p>
<p>“Oh, were you looking for me? Finding me won’t be that easy. If
you want to find me, you’ll have to try harder than that. Ha! Ha!”
The woman’s laugh echoed all across the boughs of that infinite
forest.</p>
<p>The bugs kept coming to attack Han Sen, but the fire that
enveloped him was enough to incinerate any that came too close.
Fortunately, none were actually able to do anything to him.</p>
<p>“Ugh, your bugs are useless! Why are you wasting my time?” Han
Sen stood in the middle of the bug fog, while the flames around him
raged even hotter.</p>
<p>All the bugs that came close were burned to a crisp, and a
pungent smell of charred corpses began to fill the forest.</p>
<p>“You are right!” The woman’s voice sounded once again, and the
bugs ran off. In an instant, they scurried out of sight.</p>
<p>Han Sen could see far through the forest, and as he peered down
a long stretch, he saw a woman appear from behind a tree. She
seemed to be clad in armor.</p>
<p>“I have heard that your Dollar is powerful. It will interest me
to see how good it really is.” Kun stood at a great distance away
from Han Sen, but her voice still reached him without trouble.</p>
<p>Han Sen put away his fire powers. He wished to say something,
but all of a sudden, a frown crossed his face. He used his fingers
to pick up a tiny bug. It was so small that it was barely visible
to the naked eye. It was practically invisible.</p>
<p>That small bug almost landed in the space between the joints of
his armor. Even though Han Sen had managed to capture and hold it
between his fingers, he did not crush it. The fiend even squirmed
in his grip, trying to return to what it had been doing.</p>
<p>Pat!</p>
<p>Han Sen used his fingers to crush the bug.</p>
<p>A smile spread over Kun’s face. She clapped and said, “Powerful
eyesight! It impresses me that you can see the products of my small
bug power. I’d like to know just how much you can see. So, tell me,
can you see this?”</p>
<p>After that, Kun disappeared from sight. And in that instant, Han
Sen heard bugs coming at him from every direction. They appeared
from every piece of bark and every leaf, and they even crawled out
of the ground. These bugs were even ugly for your liking.” The
stone gate opened, and when it did, a woman came walking out.</p>
<p>The audience could hear the noise of the bugs, but only the
Kings could actually discern where the bugs were. Not even the
Dukes were able to do that.</p>
<p>Clear Sea King’s eyes turned bright, and he smiled. “Kun’s power
is quite interesting. She turns her power into a vessel that is
smaller than the size of bacteria. Even Dollar’s full set of armor
will have gaps and seams that the insects can take advantage of.
Those bugs can probably fit into his face or even the pores of his
skin. No matter how strong Dollar is, I believe avoiding something
that small is out of the question for him.”</p>
<p>As Clear Sea King spoke, Han Sen wreathed himself in fire again.
He was completely set ablaze.</p>
<p>Although he could not see the small bugs coming for him, he
could hear the sound of them dying whenever they came close to the
heat that shielded him.</p>
<p>“Dollar, how long can you keep yourself on fire like that?” A
woman’s voice sounded through the forest again, dripping with
mockery.</p>
<p>Han Sen did not speak. All he did was look around, hoping to
catch sight of Kun.</p>
<p>King Rosa nodded. “Kun is rather smart. Her bugs of that
microscopic size are way too small. Han Sen won’t have a clue if he
has any around him or not. He’ll just have to keep burning to keep
them from getting close. He doesn’t know when or where those powers
will come at him from. But if he keeps burning like this, it’s only
a matter of time before he runs out of energy. When he uses all
that energy up, the small bug powers will finally get a chance to
drill into his body and ravage him. Kun is most certainly the one
in control of this fight. And while this fight may lack the
excitement we all crave, the stakes for Dollar are continually
increasing. We would all do well to leam from this, and understand
that ^ should never underestimate the Pirate.”</p>
<p>All the audience members could tell Dollar was being toyed with.
No matter how strong he was, he was facing an invincible enemy.
There was nothing he could do.</p>
<p>“I didn’t know fights could go on like this. This woman is
keeping Dollar from being able to make use of his powers like
Dollar. She’s suppressing him, well and truly. Kun of the Pirate is
a most fearsome being.”</p>
<p>“Yeah. Her powers are small like bacteria. We’d never know her
critters were in our bodies until it was too late. Not knowing how
you might die is quite a scary thought.”</p>
<p>“If Kun was a hitman, I’m sure her targets would be incredibly
nervous.”</p>
<p>The thieves are killers.”</p>
