<h2>Old Man in the Painting</h2>
<h3>Chapter 3213</h3>
<figure><img src="../Images/gem.gif" alt="gem" id="gem" width="120"

<p>A priest moved to protect the injured Qin Jing Zhen and the main
priest. As they retreated, he said, “My King, I will ask more
people to come and help…”</p>
<p>Qin Jing Zhen looked frustrated as he gnashed his teeth and
said, “Shut up. No one is allowed to leave the god temple. I will
kill anyone who tries to leave. If whatever happens today is made
public, you will all be killed.”</p>
<p>It was unimaginable what might happen if it was made known that
an incident took place in the alpha temple, resulting in Qin Jing
Zhen being injured. How much would that affect the Qin Kingdom? The
losses for the Qin Kingdom could not be calculated, let alone
fathomed.</p>
<p>Qin Jing Zhen could not let that happen. He believed the old man
in the painting could sort this problem out.</p>
<p>“Father!” Qin Bai cried as he ran before Qin Jing Zhen. He had
never seen Qin Jing Zhen in such a state. His hair was messed up,
and he had blood in his mouth. He looked pale and a bit green.</p>
<p>“Do not be afraid, Bai son. All is fine.” Qin Jing Zhen patted
Qin Bai on the head. He allowed a trusted man to take Qin Bai and
leave the temple.</p>
<p>Although people might become suspicious of the crown prince
leaving before everyone else, Qin Jing Zhen did not want to risk
his son’s life. He was Qin Jing Zhen’s only son, so nothing could
be allowed to happen to him.</p>
<p>He forced a smile. He looked at Han Sen, who was next to Qin
Bai, and asked, “Are you Han Sen? I have been wanting to meet you,
but I never thought we would meet at a time like this. The teacher
was right. You are a unique man.”</p>
<p>“Please forgive me for joining here uninvited,” Han Sen casually
said. He did not really care for Qin Jing Zhen. His attention was
mostly fixed on the old man and Wan’er.</p>
<p>“My King, who is the old man in the picture?” Han Sen thought
the old man in the painting looked godly. He did not look human. He
looked more like a God Spirit than a human.</p>
<p>“It is good that you came uninvited. If you had not come, my son
would be put in danger.” Qin Jing Zhen paused and went on to say,
“That elite is not a human. He is a powerful God Spirit. Back in
ancient times, he was as strong as 12 Annihilation God Spirits.”
“As strong as 12 Annihilation God Spirits?” Han Sen was shocked.
How could a God Spirit like that not be in a god temple but instead
relegated to a painting inside another god temple?</p>
<p>Qin Jing Zhen did not hide anything. “I do not really know who
he is. I only know that one of the alpha kings invited him in to
protect the temple. The legends claim he is an old god. Before the
12 main gods existed, he was already that powerful. I have tried
doing my best to research his origins, but no information about him
has been discovered.”</p>
<p>Upon hearing Qin Jing Zhen say all that, Han Sen was shocked.
The old man in the painting was clearly very powerful. When Han Sen
had fought Moment God, he got a grasp of what true power was like.
This man far exceeded that.</p>
<p>Aside from those 12 Annihilation God Spirits, only the person
inside the geno hall could be that powerful. The old man in the
painting was not him.</p>
<p>If such a powerful God Spirit existed, it would have been from
before the universe rebooted.</p>
<p>The God Hall Leader had told Han Sen that because the universe
had rebooted, a sky full of God Spirit power had been weakened. Han
Sen had been able to kill Moment God, but that was not the best
Moment God. That was because the universe had been rebooted. Moment
God had not yet recovered the god power an Annihilation God Spirit
should have had.</p>
<p>The old man in the painting was likely a powerful God Spirit
from a time before the universe was rebooted. It was unclear why he
had not been affected by the reboot. Either way, that was why he
had such a scary god power.</p>
<p>Even if the old man was the strongest Annihilation God Spirit,
Han Sen did not think he could beat Wan’er while she was in that
mode.</p>
<p>Wan’er’s eyes looked the same as they always did. It was like
she had not heard what the old man in the painting said. She
floated like she had not seen the old man in the painting.</p>
<p>“The latitude and longitude of the world is just a picture,” the
old man angrily said. He seemed to have been enraged by her
ignorance of him. He moved his cane and sent a miraculous power
flying at Wan’er.</p>
<p>Han Sen had witnessed Xie Qing King use a power that enabled him
to draw something and have that thing come to life, but he had
never seen anything real become a painting.</p>
<p>The old man in the painting emitted a god light. Everything in
the temple became a 2D picture.</p>
<p>It was like the entire scene became a 2D anime. Everything was
very unreal. Wan’er, who had a gold fire around her body, was not
affected by the power. She still floated as she approached the old
man. The power used against her did not seem to affect her in the
least.</p>
<p>The face of the old man in the painting changed. He was a
drawing god. Before the universe was rebooted, he was an
Annihilation God Spirit. Back then, there were more than 12
Annihilation God Spirits.</p>
<p>But he had fallen and joined the God Chaos Party. In his last
fight, he wanted to escape the disastrous rebooting of the
universe. He hid inside a drawing that had an incredible god power.
That was how he managed to survive. He was not erased by the
rebooting of the universe.</p>
<p>He also did not want to get trapped inside the painting. A king
of the Qin Kingdom randomly found the god painting. He accidentally
opened the painting. It allowed the painting god to be set free. He
thanked the Qin Kingdom’s king, but he also wanted a place to stay.
The painting god had lost his god temple, so he agreed to guard the
Qin Kingdom’s Alpha Temple and accept the sacrifices of the
kingdom’s royalty.</p>
<p>The painting god had heard the legends about Qin Xiu and Qin
Wan’er. Back then, he was still trapped inside the painting. He had
never seen Qin Xiu or Qin Wan’er. He also did not care much about
legends like that.</p>
<p>Humans use god spirit blood pulses and gene power. They could
not get very strong, but right now, that Wan’er in front of him
made him drop a pretense of flippancy and take things deathly
seriously.</p>
<p>Seeing his painting god power was unable to affect Wan’er, the
painting god’s god light flashed. He gathered up power on the
wooden cane.</p>
<p>The wine bottle, which was hanging on the wooden cane, flew up.
It poured out an elixir that was like ink. The painting god put the
tip of the wooden cane into the liquid. It was like a giant pen
splashing ink on Wan’er.</p>
<p>The whole world suddenly turned into a painting. Wherever the
painting god’s cane reached, the space that touched the ink turned
into darkness. It was like a piece of paper god had painted black.
Whatever had been on the paper before was covered by the ink. It
was like it had never existed in the first place.</p>
<p>Anything touched by the ink on the cane was enveloped by
darkness. The old man waved his wooden cane, turning half of the
god temple black. Wan’er was in the half of the temple that had
turned black.</p>
<p>Now, the god temple looked incredibly weird. Half of it was like
its usual god temple self, whereas the other half was a 2D world of
darkness.</p>
