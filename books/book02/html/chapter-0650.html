	<h3>Chapter 650</h3>

	<p>Han Sen looked behind Wang Yuhang and saw the Red-Scale Dragon turning the corner of the peak, apparently giving
		chase. It was running as fast as a rabbit, but it wasn&#8217;t an ordinary pursuit. Something wasn&#8217;t quite
		right.</p>

	<p>That was when Han Sen froze. Behind the Red-Scale Dragon was another creature: a massive elephant composed of
		white bones.</p>

	<p>The already-giant Red-Scale Dragon looked like a chew toy before the White-Bone Elephant. The elephant&#8217;s
		trunk ensnared the fleeing Red-Scale Dragon, lifted it up, and gobbled it up in one whole mouthful. The virgin
		snow was now splattered with blood.</p>

	<p>&#8220;Holy smokes!&#8221; Han Sen swore in his heart, turned around, and quickly started running.</p>

	<p>Wang Yuhang truly was born unlucky. Even out here, in the midst of a fight, he had managed to attract the
		attention of a monstrous super creature. Han Sen regretted the fact that he had not just decided to come alone,
		as taking on a berserk sacred-blood Red-Scale Dragon solo was far better than any super creature alternative.
	</p>

	<p>Fortunately, the super creature was caught up munching on its draconic snack, which bought Han Sen and Wang
		Yuhang the enough time to get away.</p>

	<p>&#8220;Little Uncle, I have a question I would like to ask you,&#8221; Han Sen gasped out, after reaching a safe
		place, far from the dangers of the super creature.</p>

	<p>&#8220;What would that be?&#8221; Wang Yuhang was gasping, as well.</p>

	<p>&#8220;How did you ever manage to hunt creatures by yourself?&#8221; Han Sen asked. Wang Yuhang seemed to be a
		magnet for the most wretched of creatures. To begin hunting a small creature, only to end up being run off by a
		larger creature seemed to be a regular occurrence, so it was strange to Han Sen that Wang Yuhang had managed to
		survive for so long.</p>

	<p>&#8220;Brother Han, I must confess to you that I am rarely ever able to slay monsters by myself. Even if I do
		manage to slay a creature, I almost never receive their loot. To get where I am today, I have mostly been
		carried.&#8221; Wang Yuhang&#8217;s face was red as he admitted his embarrassing truth.</p>

	<p>Han Sen was unsure of how to reply. Fortunately, Yuhang hailed from the Wang family. If he hadn&#8217;t, he would
		have had great difficulty carving out an identity and some modicum of prominence for himself. It would have been
		worse than how Han Sen started out, and chances of survival would be low.</p>

	<p>For a big elite like Wang Yuhang to need others to help carry him was a pity.</p>

	<p>It was strange, though. Wang Yuhang was a talented warrior, and in terms of power, the peacock crossbow was the
		only thing that would give Han Sen an edge if they were ever to duel. Wang Yuhang was almost as good as the
		Queen, and it was a shame he lacked the self-confidence he needed to drive him forward.</p>

	<p>&#8220;How about this then, Little Uncle? I have formed a team composed of elites dedicated to hunting super
		creatures. If you are interested, I will accept you amongst its ranks. However, if you are to join, you will
		have to sign a contract. This contract states that you are to adhere to my every command,&#8221; Han Sen told
		Wang Yuhang, looking at him.</p>

	<p>Although Wang Yuhang was an unlucky person, Han Sen thought his uncanny ability to attract super creatures would
		be a valuable trait for such a team. Han Sen would just need really strong armor to keep Wang Yuhang alive, so
		he could kite and tank super creatures effectively in battle.</p>

	<p>&#8220;Brother Han!&#8221; Wang Yuhang suddenly jumped in front of Han Sen&#8217;s face. He grabbed Han
		Sen&#8217;s hand, placed it on his own chest, and started to cry. He was so touched, he was unable to speak.</p>

	<p>&#8220;Little Uncle, if you have something to say then say it.&#8221; Han Sen quickly snatched back his hand,
		afraid Wang Yuhang&#8217;s next question would be a proposition to sleep with him.</p>

	<p>But again, Wang Yuhang grabbed Han Sen&#8217;s hand, not wanting to let go. He enthusiastically said,
		&#8220;Brother Han, you are a true brother of mine. You are one of the few people who are able to see the good
		that resides within me. You are the sun in my sky, scattering away the clouds of contempt. You light up my
		world, Han Sen!&#8221;</p>

	<p>Wang Yuhang was genuinely touched. Although he did not fight much, due to his awful luck, his ability to attract
		super creatures was a great boon for Han Sen to have. As a result, for Wang Yuhang, this would be the first time
		his trait was a benefit.</p>

	<p>The Wang family, despite providing him with many goodies from their various hunts, never brought him with them
		because of the bad luck that accompanied him.</p>

	<p>When Wang Yuhang wandered off on his own, it was a misadventure just waiting to happen. After killing a few
		creatures, a far-more fearsome foe would be waiting for him every time. This was the first time he had been
		offered a place on a team.</p>

	<p>Now that Han Sen actually wanted him, Wang Yuhang only wished he could have met him sooner. He was eternally
		grateful to be offered this opportunity.</p>

	<p>&#8220;Oh, look! I have a contract right here in my pocket. You should take a look at it. The conditions therein
		may be a little harsh, but it is what it is. Hunting super creatures was never meant to be a walk in the park,
		after all.&#8221; Han Sen pulled the contract out of his pocket and handed it over to Wang Yuhang.</p>

	<p>Han Sen formulated this contract a while ago, while composing a team. This contract was originally designed for
		the Queen, but because she had been so busy in recent times, she had not been able to return to the shelter and
		sign it. Now that Han Sen had deemed Wang Yuhang a suitable candidate for the team, he thought he might as well
		give it to him for the time being.</p>

	<p>Wang Yuhang looked it over and signed it without hesitation. The conditions were, just like Han Sen had said,
		harsh. It didn&#8217;t inhibit his eagerness to sign, however, as the terms were still fair.</p>

	<p>Han Sen looked happy after this. He took back the contract, signed it himself, and provided Wang Yuhang with the
		copy.</p>

	<p>&#8220;Little Uncle, you are hereby a part of my team.&#8221; Han Sen smiled at him.</p>

	<p>Wang Yuhang, all excitement, asked, &#8220;Bossman, how many other elites do we have amongst our ranks?&#8221;
	</p>

	<p>&#8220;Oh, let me see&#8230; two! Just two. You and I.&#8221; Han Sen thought it was better not to hide the
		truth. Finding other powerful people that were not already part of a faction or guild was difficult. He was
		lucky to have someone who did not already have obligations, and particularly so to have someone who had already
		unlocked their gene lock.</p>

	<p>Even though there were many elites who were alone, they were usually invited to big guilds and factions casually,
		regardless of their status. There, they could reap benefits and continue training. The chances of any random
		elite joining Han Sen, a person without a particularly outstanding background, was quite slim.</p>

	<p>Wang Yuhang did not mind this at all. In fact, he was already thinking of a way in which he could aid Han
		Sen&#8217;s cause. He then told Han Sen, &#8220;Bossman, I know someone who is really powerful. He is a friend
		of mine; perhaps we can invite him to join the team?&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;Who?&#8221; Han Sen was always intrigued by someone who was described as &#8216;really powerful.&#8217; It
		was too difficult to hunt super creatures in the Second Shelter solo, but now, people in the world were aware of
		the existence of super creatures. Although no one in the Second Shelter was able to kill them yet, hiring others
		for the cause wouldn&#8217;t prove as tough anymore.</p>

	<p>&#8220;His name is Lei Heng Wu. He may not hail from a family of any particular notoriety or fame, but his family
		does possess a special skill of sorts. It is called Giant Thunderbolt Sacred Lance. I have seen it in action,
		and it is wickedly powerful. He is a top elite and has not pledged allegiance to any guild or cause just yet. I
		am also a good friend of his, which may be the connection we need to get him to join you,&#8221; Wang Yuhang
		said.</p>

	<p>Han Sen asked about Lei Heng Wu. He sounded like the sort of person he would need on his team, so he decided to
		follow Wang Yuhang and pay this man a visit.</p>

	<p>Han Sen was unable to kill the Red-Scale Dragon as he had planned to, due to it being eaten by the White-Bone
		Elephant. He still needed a T-rex soul, so he was still determined to find one, one way or another.</p>

	<p>Luckily, Lei Heng Wu was in a rather large human shelter. Han Sen wanted to take the opportunity to browse the
		markets and see if he could snag a sacred-blood T-rex beast soul.</p>
