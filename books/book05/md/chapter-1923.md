  Han Sen was believed to have obtained his Teeth Knife knifemind in one and a half months. What’s more, his knifemind was very close to the proficiency that only a King could demonstrate. It dazed the Narrow Moon elites into a state of disbelief.

They had seen this with their own eyes, though. And so they couldn’t actually doubt it.

They couldn’t claim that Han Sen was cheating, either. Yisha was the only other that could practice Teeth Knife in such a fashion. Even if Yisha was helping Han Sen cheat somehow, there was no way Han Sen should have been able to earn such a knifemind in such a short time.

People were worried, though. And no one could doubt Han Sen’s talent.

Han Sen’s performance with the red mist spring was shocking. Many members of Moon Garden, such as Rebecca and Du Lishe, now greatly feared Han Sen.

The day after the events of the red mist spring, Yisha gave Han Sen a call. She didn’t say much, but she provided him with a geno art to practice with.

You performed well. This geno art is your reward. But you cannot be cocky about it. You need to remember that if you do not obtain deified status, it will be useless. Your strength won’t matter.”

She gave him some Viscount geno fluid, too, so he could practice.

Han Sen did not understand what Yisha meant by this. But he was relieved that Yisha had protected him, indicating that things were okay between them.

Not long after, Moon Garden invited Han Sen to become a member, but Yisha rejected it on his behalf. Yisha had wanted Han Sen to join Moon Garden to gain support from the tribe, but she changed her mind after all that had happened. She didn’t want him joining them.

Because of this, the Kings at Narrow Moon held another meeting. They tried to convince Yisha to allow Han Sen to become a member of Moon Garden. Her response was cold. “My student is not any boy you can push around however you wish.”

After that, she left. She didn’t save face for Moon Wheel King, either.

Moon Wheel King and the others wanted Han Sen to join simply because Han Sen’s talents were too shocking. His mind far exceeded the capabilities of others at the same level. If he could join Moon Garden and practice with the members there, the others should also benefit and become stronger.

Yisha was no longer interested in this arrangement, though. And it wasn’t as if they could force Han Sen to take part in Moon Garden.

…

Han Sen was in his room, playing with the Jade Turtle Spell. Normally, it was a one-time use item. It wouldn’t come off after being used. Instead, its power would be exhausted after a day and the entire thing would shatter.

When Han Sen returned to base, his body felt awful under the weight of the Jade Turtle Spell. He tried to pull it off, but alas, he was unable to. Since he couldn’t use super king spirit mode, he ended up trying the Dongxuan Sutra. He spread its influence into the Jade Turtle Spell, then simulated its powers and removed it from himself.

The power of the Jade Turtle Spell was very deep. Han Sen only simulated a tiny part of it, but he was able to learn a lot. It also made him wonder where it had come from.

Due to the power being too deep and profound, Han Sen was unable to learn it all. So, he began fiddling with the thing using the Dongxuan Aura to slowly learn more about it.

The geno art Yisha had given Han Sen was a light-based art called Moon. As he practiced it, he found that it fit him quite well.

Moon was fairly amazing, as well. It could use the powers of light to generate a moon of his own. The power was something like the ability of an Earl to generate a spirit that wasn’t actually a real spirit.

Han Sen was quite interested in this geno art. And since it was Yisha who had allowed him to practice it, he didn’t dare be lazy with the gift. He practiced with it whenever he was able to.

The biggest reward he had received from the events at the red mist spring was his Spell evolving. Quite surprisingly, the Viscount class Spell was able to unleash light powers of its own. Furthermore, it possessed a third form.

Geno armaments had two forms, traditionally. One was the plain armorset form that was always there for him to equip.

The second form came from reaching the second stage of evolution. In Han Sen’s case, it was a lady form; the gunner called Spell. Xie Qing King’s book and Wang Yuhang’s bike were the second forms, too.

Very few, if any, had heard of there being a third possible form. Han Sen knew very little about geno armaments, though, so he wasn’t sure if it was how uncommon it truly was. Regardless, this was the first time he had seen or heard of such a thing.

Spell’s third form was that of a sniper rifle. Han Sen tried out the rifle and found it surprisingly easy to get headshots from a distance of a hundred miles.

The biggest advantage of having a sniper rifle was that Han Sen’s power was concentrated into bullets. Future engagements wouldn’t be so costly, either, with the range of the weapon.

The normal power of a Viscount came from swordlights or knifelights. It was very lucky if you could cast such strikes over a distance of a few hundred meters.

But with that sniper rifle, Han Sen could guarantee headshots without his targets being aware of his presence. It was a perfect weapon for assassinations.

The only limitation was that the bullet velocity depended on Spell’s power and Han Sen’s own power. But that still meant that the stronger they grew, the stronger the bullets would become. He just couldn’t use other sources of power to fuel it.

All in all, Han Sen loved it. He could level up quite easily with the rifle, and headshots would not be difficult to get.

Tzi! Tzi!

Han Sen was playing with the Jade Turtle Spell, and as he did, something moved in his pocket. It made a sound.

Han Sen opened his pocket and saw the red mist orb inside. The seven minks were reemerging from the orb.

When they saw Han Sen, they opened their eyes and began crooning at him.

“Are you guys hungry?” Han Sen thought he understood what they were implying.

The little minks in Han Sen’s pocket nodded.

So, Han Sen fed them some xenogeneic meat. During the Red Mist Valley incident, the Viscounts had killed many creatures for him. He moved the flesh back to the base, and there was a lot. Because of this, he didn’t mind feeding the little creatures.

The seven minks munched on the flesh, and while they were eating, Han Sen used his Dongxuan Aura to scan their bodies and observe their energy flow.

After watching them for a while, something gave him a shock. The minks really were just Baron class, but their energy flows were complex. They were unlike any other Baron he had seen before.
