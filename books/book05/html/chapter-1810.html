<h3>Chapter 1810</h3>

<p>Vic coldly hummed. “Without me holding its attention, what could
you guys have done? I am the one who exerted the most effort in
felling it, so I should get the first choice of the spoils. I want
the rabbit teeth! You can have the rest.”</p>
<p>“Mister Vic, do not be ridiculous!” Han Sen responded to Vic,
his voice hard.</p>
<p>“Ridiculous? In what way am I being ridiculous? Would you like
to direct that question to my dagger, and see if it tells you how
I’m being ridiculous?” Vic held up his dagger, its tip pointed at
Han Sen.</p>
<p>Han Sen frowned. Vic thought the reason his dagger could not
kill the rabbit was because the rabbit was too powerful. He did not
have to worry about killing Han Sen, due to the equalized
powers.</p>
<p>An absolute hit on Han Sen, with the dagger, could easily kill
Han Sen.</p>
<p>“You! Get on the bridge!” Vic was still pointing the dagger at
Han Sen as he shouted. He didn’t just want the xenogeneic material;
he now wanted Han Sen to be bait.</p>
<p>Han Sen remained still, though. He stood, looking at Vic
emotionlessly.</p>
<p>“Didn’t you hear me tell you to get on the bridge?” Vic looked
at him darkly. He was not at all happy with Han Sen’s behavior, and
so he approached him.</p>
<p>Han Sen did not speak, and neither did he move. He silently
watched Vic approach.</p>
<p>“It looks like you aren’t afraid of death.” Vic was so angry, he
swung his dagger at Han Sen.</p>
<p>Han Sen had ignored his authority, and so he really wanted to
teach the man a lesson. He wanted to injure Han Sen, and then toss
him on the bridge.</p>
<p>The strike was disturbingly invisible. The Sky-Demon powers were
so very unpredictable, and Vic used them well.</p>
<p>But in Han Sen’s eyes, it was nothing special. He wagered Zero
and Han Yan were better with the Falsified-Sky Sutra than Vic was
with the Sky-Demon Sutra.</p>
<p>Vic put a fair amount of raw power behind the skill, but he had
little talent with it.</p>
<p>Yisha looked at Han Sen with interest. She was keen to see how
Han Sen might handle a confrontation such as this. Sky- Demon
powers were unpredictable, and not even she would dare challenge
Vic. His attack should be impossible to evade.</p>
<p>Yisha kept thinking that if she was Han Sen, the best thing she
could take advantage of would be range. Vic’s power could not be
released inside that place, so if he couldn’t use his sword to
unleash the ability, then the skill ought to be useless.</p>
<p>But Han Sen was not planning on falling back or anything of the
sort. Despite seeing Vic’s dagger approaching his neck, he
continued to stand where he was.</p>
<p>“Is he not going to move? How is he going to deal with the
Sky-Demon power? It is impossible to block or even dodge.”</p>
<p>Yisha was really surprised.</p>
<p>Vic felt like something was wrong as he attacked, though. He
wondered why Han Sen made no effort to move, but he was still
confident in his Sky-Demon power, and he carried on with his skill
cast.</p>
<p>Seeing the dagger about to hit his neck, Han Sen suddenly waved
his arm to bring the scabbard up against the dagger. “Does that guy
not know that Sky-Demon powers won’t miss? Does he really want to
block it?” Hawk Wing looked shocked. Yisha only frowned. Vic was
laughing coldly. He put even more strength behind the swing.</p>
<p>Dong!</p>
<p>Vic’s confident strike was blocked a mere three inches away from
Han Sen’s neck.</p>
<p>Han Sen didn’t even look at the dagger. He was staring at Vic
the whole time, and yet, he managed to block the blade.</p>
<p>“How is that possible!” These words ran through the minds of
Vic, Yisha, and Hawk Wing all at the same time. Even when both
parties had similar strength, it should have been impossible for
Sky-Demon power to be blocked. And Han Sen had done so with such
ease.</p>
<p>Vic looked to be in shock. He struggled to believe what had
happened. He didn’t want to believe what he had just seen.</p>
<p>Vic clenched his teeth and started raging with his dagger. Like
a hailstorm, he thrashed at Han Sen.</p>
<p>Han Sen just stood there the whole time, though, inside the
violence. He waved his scabbard, the whole time looking at Vic and
not his dagger. His scabbard was able to block each and every
strike.</p>
<p>All those strikes had not been enough to even make Han Sen move
his feet.</p>
<p>“What’s happening? Has Sky-Demon power lost its effectiveness
here? How can it be blocked? Who is this guy?!” Hawk Wing screamed
after breaking out of his reverie.</p>
<p>Yisha looked at the scene with a confused expression, thinking,
“Human? Dollar? What kind of race is this? How can I not have heard
of people like this before?”</p>
<p>Vic was extremely shocked. He never thought his Sky-Demon power
could be blocked by someone on the same level as him. “Are you
done?” Han Sen asked quietly.</p>
<p>He took a step forward and waved his scabbard at Vic. The
swordmind started up.</p>
<p>Vic fell back, but it was too late. He tried to use his dagger
to block, but he failed.</p>
<p>Blergh!</p>
<p>Vic felt as if his belly had just been hammered. Blood spilled
over his lips, and his body fell backwards onto the bridge.</p>
<p>Vic landed on the bridge, just as it started to shake. The
geyser of milk fired from below.</p>
<p>Vic ignored his pain and rolled forward to evade the white
juice. But this time, the white juice did not wash away. It
gathered up on the bridge, and as if it had a life of its own, it
climbed towards him.</p>
<p>Vic had dodged the liquid, but he hadn’t expected it to react
like this. The white liquid touched his foot and was immediately
absorbed.</p>
<p>Han Sen, Yisha, and Hawk Wing were shocked. The white juice
seemed like it was alive. It didn’t seem like a genuine liquid.
Roar! Vic screamed. His muscles and bones began to expand, and a
horn grew from his forehead.</p>
<p>His handsome face suddenly took on the shape of a cruel demon’s.
His fangs were on display, as a black miasma shrouded him. He took
on the appearance of Asura.</p>
<p>Vic slowly turned around. The purple had vanished from his eyes,
and they were now red.</p>
<p>Roar! There was more roaring. Vic was headed for Han Sen, as the
demon-looking body came right before him. Five black nails, as
sharp as daggers, came right for his head.</p>
