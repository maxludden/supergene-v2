	<p>&#8220;This is somewhat troublesome, but it does not mean there is no chance to beat him.&#8221; Han Sen thought
		about it and asked, &#8220;When is the fight?&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;It is not a fight. The four of you will all attend the military contest. Whoever with the highest rank
		will become my guard. Unfortunately, there is no way to fake it in the military contest. You have to rely on
		your own strength,&#8221; Ji Yanran lamented.</p>

	<p>If she was able to do something, Ji Yanran would definitely let Han Sen win.</p>

	<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s good. I will have a lot of time until then,&#8221; Han Sen smiled and said.</p>

	<p>Hanging up, Han Sen started to think how he could win.</p>

	<p>Li Mingtang had once said that one needed to have at least a hundred and twenty in fitness to break his Super
		Diamond Body. However, even Han Sen used all he got, he would only be able to approach a hundred, which was
		still far from the threshold.</p>

	<p>In addition, Han Sen did not have any strong beast soul weapons, so he could not depend on a weapon either. In
		addition, he was forbidden to enter God&#8217;s Sanctuary, so there was no way he could increase his geno
		points.</p>

	<p>Han Sen gave it a lot of thought and the only possible way was to break the Super Diamond Body from within. Han
		Sen did not believe that someone who had just succeeded in practicing Super Diamond Body could strengthen their
		inner organs as much as their bones and muscles. As long as he could send his force into their inner organs, he
		would be able to break their bodies.</p>

	<p>Han Sen was especially good at this kind of force. The yin force in Yin Yang Blast could achieve that. To be more
		confident, Han Sen decided to spend more time to practice Yin Yang Blas, especially the yin force which could
		penetrate one&#8217;s body.</p>

	<p>Currently, when Han Sen used the yin force, he could penetrate a steel plate 3 inches thick and send 60% of his
		force to the object behind it.</p>

	<p>This meant he would be able to send enough force to one&#8217;s inner organs through one&#8217;s skin and
		muscles. However, the conversion rate of 60% was still a bit low. Han Sen wished that he could increase that
		rates to more than 90% and preferably 95% before the contest.</p>

	<p>Otherwise, with Han Sen&#8217;s fitness of a little less than a hundred, even if he could use the yin force
		effectively, he might not be able to hurt his opponent. After all, his opponent would be someone with a fitness
		level over a hundred.</p>

	<p>It was actually harder to practice the yin force than the yang force. Also, there was almost no convenient way to
		practice it. Han Sen had to spend a lot of time and used all his brainpower.</p>

	<p>Although Han Sen did not spend all his time on it, he had been practicing the yin force for several years. And
		even after that, his conversion rate was just about 60%, which showed how difficult it was to practice the yin
		force.</p>

	<p>During the amount of time that Daphne traveled back to the Alliance, Han Sen was practicing the yin force every
		chance he got. He did not log into the virtual camp again. Qin Xuan was frequently in the camp, wishing to meet
		Han Sen again and learned some things from him. Unfortunately, she never did and was disappointed every time.
	</p>

	<p>Before Daphne reached the human space harbor, a warship sent from the Alliance came to it and investigated
		everybody separately.</p>

	<p>This time, Daphne had suffered a great loss, including two of the most renowned professors studying Crystallizer
		civilization. Many researchers also died on the planet. The accident was quite severe.</p>

	<p>Fortunately, the two advanced crystals that Han Sen brought back was submitted by Ji Yanran, which was credited
		by the Alliance. Coupled with the great influence of her family, Ji Yanran was not punished. After all, she was
		not responsible for the excavation work.</p>

	<p>After returning to the Alliance, the soldiers on Daphne eventually gained some freedom. Although Daphne would not
		be on a mission in a short amount of time, the soldiers were not excused. The good news was that they could
		enter God&#8217;s Sanctuary as they wished.</p>

	<p>It was more than a month until the military contest started. Han Sen planned to use this amount of time to
		increase his geno points as much as possible so that he would have a bigger chance at the contest.</p>

	<p>Returning to Goddess Shelter again, Han Sen found that Yang Manli had done a good job managing the shelter. Many
		people had already resided in the shelter, which brought Han Sen more money than he thought. Each month, he had
		an income of more than ten million. The region was not quite populated, so he would earn even more if there were
		more people. Zhu Ting had got his hands on Treading Cloud a long time ago. Because Han Sen was absent from
		God&#8217;s Sanctuary for a long time, it was the first chance Zhu Ting could have given the hyper geno art to
		him.</p>

	<p>After receiving Treading Cloud, Han Sen went to hunt. He still asked Zero to stay in Goddess Shelter. Since she
		could not gain geno points from eating meat and could not use beast souls either, there was no point for her to
		go hunting. She could stay in the shelter and defend it when there were creatures attacking the shelter.</p>

	<p>Han Sen went deep into the glaciers and snow mountains alone. On his way, Han Sen was almost traveling at full
		speed and bypassed all the creatures he saw. He wanted to kill creatures that were so small that they could be
		finished in one to two days in order to increase his geno points rapidly.</p>

	<p>However, few creatures were of a small size in this area. Having traveled 2 to 3 days in the glaciers and snow
		mountains, Han Sen eventually saw a smaller creature that he had never eaten before.</p>

	<p>It was a creature the size of a cat. It looked like a ferret covered in shiny purple fur, eating red fruits
		growing on a bush at the foot of a snow mountain.</p>

	<p>Having never seen this kind of creature, Han Sen did not dare to be careless. Making sure there was no other
		creatures around him, he sneaked to the purple ferret quietly.</p>

	<p>However, when he was still 100 feet from the purple ferret, it suddenly noticed him. Glancing at him with its
		purple eyes, it was not scared away, but threw itself at Han Sen fiercely.</p>

	<p>Han Sen&#8217;s heart leapt. The speed of the ferret was incredibly fast. It came to Han Sen&#8217;s face in just
		a moment.</p>

	<p>&#8220;A sacred-blood creature!&#8221; Han Sen was both surprised and overjoyed. The creature&#8217;s speed was
		even faster than himself, so there was no doubt that it was a sacred-blood creature of Second God&#8217;s
		Sanctuary.</p>

	<p>Using both Heresy Mantra and Overload, Han Sen stepped out to dodge the purple ferret&#8217;s attack by a hair.
		At the same time, he punched at the tiny body of the purple ferret.</p>

	<p>In the air, the purple ferret twisted its body in an incredible angle and dodged Han Sen&#8217;s punch,
		continuing to strike at Han Sen.</p>

	<p>Having no time to move around, Han Sen was scratched by the ferret. The armor coming with the fairy queen was not
		effective at all. If Han Sen did not avoid the attack, that scratch would gut him.</p>

	<p>An injury like this was not enough to make Han Sen cringe. He was still very calm, using his footwork to fight
		the ferret.</p>

	<p>The strength of the creature was completely beyond Han Sen&#8217;s imagination. What was worse was that his skin
		scratched started to bleed purple blood. Obviously, he was poisoned.</p>
