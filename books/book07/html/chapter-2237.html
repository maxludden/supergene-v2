<p>Han Sen and his team didn’t receive any more missions. They
suspected that Ice Blue Knight King was grounding them to ensure
Bai Wei’s safety, but they couldn’t be certain. They were stuck in
the base for two weeks, and they weren’t given a single excuse to
leave it.</p>
<p>But for Han Sen, that was ideal. After what happened with Night
River King, who knew if other assassins might be lurking outside
the base with Ancient Warrior Statues, just waiting for their
chance to kill him.</p>
<p>The tri-colored Demon Bug King Bai Sema had been heavily
damaged. Only Han Yan’s gold Demon Bug King Bai Sema was currently
usable. If the same thing happened to them again, they’d have
nothing left to repel such a horrible attack.</p>
<p>Staying inside the shelter of the base under the constant
protection of the knights was currently Han Sen’s best option.</p>
<p>These thoughts lasted until the Ji family returned the diary to
him.</p>
<p>The Ji family’s code crackers were quite skilled. After they
managed to decode the diary, they translated Night River King’s
messages in short order.</p>
<p>The content started before Night River King came to the systems
of chaos, and the early entries were rather boring. They were only
a few words each, and they tended to be simple notes about his day.
He probably only wrote them in code out of habit.</p>
<p>When Night River King arrived in the systems of chaos, however,
he was attacked by xenogeneics while he was defending Ice Blue
System. That was where the diary got interesting.</p>
<p>Night River King hadn’t been there for long, but in that time,
he discovered something rather strange. Instead of telling the Ice
Blue Knights, he began secretly investigating on his own.</p>
<p>Sixty-seven days before Han Sen began reading the diary, Night
River King had been spending his second day stationed defensively
at the edge of the Ice Blue System. A group of xenogeneics had
approached the border of the Ice Blue System and attacked the Ice
Blue Knights that were on guard.</p>
<p>Then Night River King had made this note:</p>
<p>“It was here. It was always here.”</p>
<p>That didn’t make much sense. Han Sen didn’t know exactly what it
meant, but it clearly indicated that Night River King had found
something.</p>
<p>Han Sen kept looking through Night River King’s diary. He
noticed that over the following days, each entry was short.</p>
<p>“It’s still here. Purple.”</p>
<p>“Seventh is infected. Haven’t found anything abnormal.”</p>
<p>“Thirty-second is infected. Nothing abnormal.”</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>“First is abnormal. Observation ongoing.”</p>
<p>The short entries continued for an entire month. Night River
King seemed to have discovered something, and although his entries
were short and mostly without emotion, Han Sen could sense the
worry that had filled Night River King as he wrote.</p>
<p>“What did he find that scared him so badly, I wonder? What are
his notes talking about?” Han Sen wondered with a frown. He didn’t
have any answers yet.</p>
<p>The diary continued in that way for some time. The entries led
up to a few days before Night River King had come and attempted to
kill Han Sen. At that point, the diary included something new.</p>
<p>“Edward asked me to kill Han Sen. It is risky, but it is worth a
try. If I succeed, I can be away from it.”</p>
<p>Han Sen frowned again. Night River King knew helping Edward
would be a dangerous venture, but he was scared of this mysterious
thing even more.</p>
<p>Over the next few days, Night River King continued his
observations. He still referred to “it” and the numbered creatures
frequently. Those numbered creatures had undergone many weird
changes.</p>
<p>The day before Night River King came to kill Han Sen, he wrote
his last entry. He had seen something that shocked him a lot.</p>
<p>His last entry was much lengthier than the others. What was
written there made Han Sen feel an uneasy sense of disbelief.</p>
<p>“Good god. Seventh became King class… It’s… It affected number
seven… What is that power? Is it dangerous? Can I use it?” Night
River King seemed very nervous, and he used many question
marks.</p>
<p>“What did Night River King see? What are these numbers he’s
referring to? It can raise creatures to King class? If it is inside
the Ice Blue System, and Night River King saw it so regularly,
there’s no way that it has escaped the notice of all the other Ice
Blue Knights.” Han Sen frowned as he thought to himself. But Night
River King’s diary never once described exactly what “it” was. And
so, Han Sen couldn’t accurately guess its nature.</p>
<p>“Purple. Night River King found it, but the Ice Blue Knights
with him did not. He said it affected a number of creatures, and
one of those became King class…” Han Sen sorted through the various
leads, but there was nothing solid enough to go on.</p>
<p>“It looks like I will have to go to where Night River King was
originally stationed. If I head there, I might be able to find out
what he is referencing,” Han Sen proceeded to think. It was simply
a shame that the Ice Blue Knights owned every inch of the system.
He couldn’t just go wherever he wished.</p>
<p>Han Sen used Night River King as an excuse to ask for more
information about the borders of the system. In the time that Night
River King had been with the Ice Blue Knights on the border, none
of them had ranked up from Duke to King class.</p>
<p>Han Sen had thought that the numbers might have indicated the
Ice Blue Knights that were working with Night River King, but that
seemed to have been an incorrect assumption.</p>
<p>“What are these numbers referencing? If I can just figure that
out, they shouldn’t be too difficult to find,” Han Sen said with a
groan.</p>
<p>Night River King’s final diary entry was very intriguing to Han
Sen. If the mysterious “it” could raise another creature to King
class, then Han Sen was very interested in finding out what it
was.</p>
<p>But since it had terrified Night River King to such a degree, it
was probably quite dangerous as well.</p>
<p>“How do I get to where Night River King was stationed as a
guard?” Han Sen tried to think of a way to get there, but no ideas
seemed to stick.</p>
<p>Han Sen needed to get to the very edge of the Ice Blue System,
and only proper Ice Blue Knights were allowed to fill those posts.
Han Sen was just a back-up knight, so he wasn’t qualified for the
position. He wouldn’t receive permission to go, even if he really
wanted to.</p>
<p>Plus, Han Sen didn’t think going there on his own would be a
good idea. Edward would find a way to deal with him in order to
retrieve that tablet. And Edward could definitely take advantage of
such a place.</p>
<p>But being stuck in the base, unable to discover what Night River
King was talking about, left Han Sen with an itchy feeling.</p>
<p>If the thing was as dangerous as Night River King indicated,
there was every chance it was a threat to the entire Ice Blue
System. Han Sen was included in that threat, as well.</p>
<p>A back-up knight knocked on Han Sen’s door. “Han Sen, Knight
King has asked you to meet him at his office.”</p>
<p>“Okay, I will be there,” Han Sen said, waving his thanks. He got
up and went straight to Ice Blue Knight King’s office. He had no
idea why Ice Blue Knight King had summoned him.</p>
