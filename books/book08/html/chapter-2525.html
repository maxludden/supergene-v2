<p>“Lady, why are those two words written on your back?” Little
Butterfly asked with curiosity.</p>
<p>Li Keer nibbled her lips as her face flushed. After a while, she
released a burst of laughter, then suddenly grew strangely serious.
“Dollar is good. He can mask his actions from my Very High
Sense.”</p>
<p>Little Butterfly’s eyes widened in disbelief. She had to ask,
“How was it possible for Dollar to write these words without you
having a clue that he had?”</p>
<p>Little Butterfly couldn’t believe this was possible. Li Keer had
the Very High Sense. She was like a god that could feel anything.
How could someone write words on her own back while she was
oblivious to it?</p>
<p>“I haven’t been King for long. My Very High Sense has yet to be
perfected. It isn’t strange that I might miss something
occasionally, but not just anyone could do something so bold.
Dollar made sure that I felt absolutely nothing, so whatever talent
he used must have been quite strong. I clearly underestimated him.”
Li Keer’s beautiful eyes flashed strangely.</p>
<p>“My lady, if Dollar is that strong, do you want him to be your
silkworm?” Little Butterfly blinked.</p>
<p>“I don’t know him well enough yet. I cannot select him simply
based on this showing of power. Plus, I cannot find him. Even if I
wanted him to be my silkworm, how am I supposed to get in touch
with him?” Li Keer blinked.</p>
<p>Han Sen hadn’t known what Li Keer was thinking, but he clearly
wasn’t interested in her.</p>
<p>The reason Han Sen had been able to write words on her back
without her knowledge was because he had used his Dongxuan Sutra.
He locked down all the universal cogwheels around them, allowing
himself to move without being noticed. So, Li Keer was unable to
feel anything. As far as the universal cogwheels were concerned, it
was like nothing had happened. She wouldn’t realize Han Sen had
taken the time to write something down on her back.</p>
<p>When it came to the powers of sense, the Dongxuan Sutra wasn’t
any inferior to the Very High Sense. Li Keer didn’t know what the
Dongxuan Sutra was, and so that was the reason she lost the
contest. Had she known about the geno art, she wouldn’t have lost
in such a terrible fashion.</p>
<p>The bronze furnace kept making crying noises as it led the way.
The fires of the creature rose and fell. A hundred swords were
poking out from inside it. All of them were of different sizes. It
appeared as if it had spent a lot of time slaying core xenogeneics
and taking their xenogeneic genes to produce swords.</p>
<p>“Where are you taking me?” Han Sen asked the bronze furnace.</p>
<p>He had asked the bronze furnace to find deified xenogeneics. It
had been leading him for half a day, but they had yet to find a
single shadow lurking nearby. As they traveled, the space around
them was getting quieter and quieter. There were not even planets
or asteroids around.</p>
<p>“Choo-choo!” the furnace shot out some flames. They hovered in
the sky to form the words, “Steel castle.”</p>
<p>“What is that place?” Han Sen asked.</p>
<p>“Deified xenogeneic,” the bronze smithy said by producing more
of those fire words.</p>
<p>The intelligence of xenogeneics was quite limited. They were
never that good at expressing themselves. Han Sen couldn’t ask
much, but it was fine as long as they were going someplace with
deified xenogeneics. He wasn’t going to be scared of any power he
faced.</p>
<p>He followed the bronze furnace in flight. After flying for a few
days, they saw a castle hanging in space.</p>
<p>The castle seemed to have been made of metal, and it had been
constructed using cogwheels and machinery. Two giant exhaust pipes
came out of it. The cogwheels spun, and fire billowed out of it
continually. Han Sen could even hear the sound of a generator
within, and it hummed melodically.</p>
<p>That giant thing was like a huge steel monster. It floated in
the air, and that entire trip, Han Sen hadn’t encountered a single
xenogeneic. That had seemed quite abnormal to Han Sen.</p>
<p>The closer they got to the castle-like machine, the weirder it
looked. The giant steel cogwheels spun, and there were clanging
sounds like a blacksmith working in a smithy. Fire came pouring out
of the machine. It was like some sort of factory.</p>
<p>“The xenogeneics of the core area are so weird. This steel
castle can’t be a xenogeneic, can it?” Han Sen was shocked.</p>
<p>As Han Sen was thinking about this, he suddenly saw the steel
monster rumble forward like a bulldozer. Flames roared out of its
twin exhaust pipes. The running generator seemed to rev up, and the
rhythmic banging noises became one sustained sound.</p>
<p>The cogwheels of various sizes spun like mad all along its robot
arms. The next second, the steel door of the castle opened. Fire
came bursting out as if it was a big furnace. From within the steel
castle, a ten-meter-tall steel robot appeared. The xenogeneic
looked very strong as it strode out.</p>
<p>The robot xenogeneic looked very ramshackle. It couldn’t compare
with the modern AI robots that Han Sen was familiar with. Its
design was more reminiscent of the armor of knights in ancient
Europe.</p>
<p>As the castle door opened and belched out more angry fire, more
steel robots queued out of the castle. It was like a production
line of toys.</p>
<p>Han Sen stared at the emerging robots in shock. He opened his
eyes wide and said, “King class core xenogeneics? This steel
monster castle can make King core xenogeneics?”</p>
<p>Encountering a bunch of King class xenogeneics wouldn’t surprise
Han Sen, but finding a monster that could produce them with ease?
Han Sen hadn’t seen anything like that before.</p>
<p>Within a second, the steel robots that had emerged from the
castle assembled into separate regiments. Then they all marched on
Han Sen.</p>
<p>Han Sen wanted to try out the power of his Gold Robot General.
When he summoned it, the Gold Armor General appeared around
him.</p>
<p>Han Sen used his mind to control the gold robot the same way he
controlled his own body. He lifted the saw-like gold greatsword.
The cogwheels on the blade whirled, and the sawblade spun, too. It
was like a giant chainsaw.</p>
<p>Katcha!</p>
<p>Han Sen swung the sword, and the chainsaw swordlight cut the
robots in half. Not one of them could repel the power of his
sword.</p>
<p>“Nice, very nice… This is a good fight!” Han Sen cackled in
excitement. He kept swinging his blade, cutting through the robots
like he was slicing vegetables. He managed to kill an entire group
of those steel robots.</p>
<p>“Xenogeneic King hunted: Steel Armor. Xenogeneic gene
found.”</p>
<p>Han Sen heard the announcement play repeatedly, but there was no
mention of a beast soul.</p>
<p>“Are these really King class xenogeneics? Do they simply live in
the castle, or are they made there?” Han Sen looked at the weird
steel castle and sank into thought.</p>
<p>The first group of Steel Armors had been slain. The castle
monster looked angry. It summoned all its power to open every door
across the breadth of the castle, and many more Steel Armors came
flying out. There had to be at least a hundred, and even more were
on the way.</p>
