    <p>
      The four of them returned to the plaza in a glum mood. Although they did
      not really know Huang Xiao, they felt awful upon learning what had
      happened to him.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Please, fulfill your obligation and bring me Dollar. He is your
      strongest young one, after all.&#8221;
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen, upon his return, heard Yu Qielan speaking to the receptionist.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Fuck! If I was a surpasser, I&#8217;d kick his ass so hard!&#8221;
      Tang Zhenliu said, angrily. He wished he was a surpasser, for in his
      present state, he could hardly lay a finger on Yu Qielan.
    </p>

    <p>
      With Shura Change and Blood Injection, Yu Qielan was already able to beat
      a surpasser that was a celestial being. The hidden power he possessed was
      something not even Huang Xiao had the ability to overcome.
    </p>

    <p>
      Lin Feng was calm and did not say anything more. The people who knew him
      well, however, could tell he was suppressing a great fire of anger inside.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen suddenly stood up and walked towards the stage. He was fuming mad,
      and although he did not know Huang Xiao, he despised Yu Qielan enough to
      know what he had to do. Furthermore, he had repeatedly asked for a fight
      against Dollar.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen laughed in his heart and thought to himself, &#8220;You want to
      fight Dollar, do you? As you wish. Prepare to get spent.&#8221;
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Han Sen, what are you doing?!&#8221; Seeing Han Sen approach the
      stage, Ji Yanran became incredibly worried.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Old Han, do not be reckless! We can kill him together, once we
      become surpassers!&#8221; Tang Zhenliu called out.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;It&#8217;s only a royal shura. There&#8217;s no need for me to wait
      that long,&#8221; Han Sen said in response, as his fingers glided across
      Ji Yanran&#8217;s face. He then told her, &#8220;Sit right there and wait
      for me to kill this asshole.&#8221;
    </p>

    <p>After that, Han Sen continued his approach to the stage.</p>

    <p>
      Tang Zhenliu still wanted to prevent him from doing this, and Ji
      Yanran&#8217;s worry was not alleviated.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;If he wants to go that much, he must be confident,&#8221; Lin Feng
      calmly said, stopping the two from any further attempts to change Han
      Sen&#8217;s mind.
    </p>

    <p>
      As Han Sen neared the stage, Yu Qielan was still requesting that someone
      find Dollar so that they might fight.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Yu Qielan, right? Do you have to fight Dollar to feel good about
      yourself?&#8221; Han Sen said, as he ascended the stage and looked
      directly at his soon-to-be enemy.
    </p>

    <p>
      Everyone&#8217;s attention now turned to silently focus on Han Sen, unsure
      what he was planning to do.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Aside from Dollar, what other challenger can I fight who is worth
      my time?&#8221; Yu Qielan proudly stated.
    </p>

    <p>
      There were others aside from Huang Xiao that were willing to fight him,
      but Yu Qielan declined them all.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Okay, then. You can fight him. But first, you must beat me,&#8221;
      Han Sen calmly said.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;You? And who are you exactly, chump? I tire of you humans
      attempting to stall my true desire. How long do you expect me to fight
      scrawny worthless beings before I can go up against Dollar?&#8221; Yu
      Qielan looked at Han Sen with disdain.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;I lost to Dollar once. Dollar took me out in one-and-a-half
      punches. If you beat me, I can call upon Dollar to come over here and whip
      you like a dog. How does that sound?&#8221; Han Sen looked at Yu Qielan.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;One-and-a-half punches, huh? Is this guy for real?&#8221; Yu Qielan
      ignored Han Sen and spoke to the receptionist directly.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Of course, he is my fianc√©! He only ever speaks the truth.&#8221;
      Ji Yanran stood up and said.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;President Ji&#8217;s daughter? Fine, I&#8217;ll believe you once
      more.&#8221; Yu Qielan looked at Ji Yanran and then returned his gaze to
      Han Sen. He continued by saying, &#8220;If I win, and I am still unable to
      see Dollar, then tonight&#8217;s fighting is over. I have no interest in
      fighting noobs any longer.&#8221;
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen then coldly said, &#8220;Humanity is graced with a desire to
      uphold their word. Furthermore, we are polite. You allowed Huang Xiao to
      strike first in the last match, so allow me to return the gesture. Yu
      Qielan, I want you to make the first attack.&#8221;
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Good. If you can withstand one-and-a-half Dollar punches, we can
      quickly determine whether or not you can withstand one-point-zero of my
      punches.&#8221; Yu Qielan did not waste any time and immediately swung his
      fist.
    </p>

    <p>
      As he swung, he used Shura Change and the wretched power-boosting method
      of Blood Injection. He planned to one-hit-kill Han Sen.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen had started this match, so he couldn&#8217;t allow himself to
      immediately get punched and defeated.
    </p>

    <p>
      If the demigod stepped in now, it would be humiliating not only for him,
      but for humanity as a whole.
    </p>

    <p>
      Such a tale would be laughed about by the shura for many more generations.
      It would be a jest, the story of a proud human that sought to start a
      fight but was knocked out by a single punch in a single second.
    </p>

    <p>
      The demigod was ambivalent, and wasn&#8217;t too sure what to think. They
      couldn&#8217;t rightly save him, but they did not want him to be killed.
      As such, they were unsure about what to do.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Han Sen is still an evolver. Is he going to be okay?&#8221; A
      middle-aged man frowned while watching the video.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Unless he is close to the rank of Celestial Being, even if he was
      from the Luo family and had learned the Falsified-Sky Sutra, I do not
      believe he can beat the shura. And I say this in the knowledge that the
      Falsified-Sky Sutra is an evil and murderous talent. It is truly wicked,
      but without the necessary power, it won&#8217;t yield the results he
      desires. He will die.&#8221; The old man looked glum as he spoke. He hated
      Yu Qielan&#8217;s behavior, and despite his dire prediction, he wanted Han
      Sen to win.
    </p>

    <p>
      But the power gulf was very wide, and for Han Sen to win, it would require
      nothing short of a miracle. That was why even this old man&#8217;s
      predictions were miserable.
    </p>

    <p>
      On another planet, Luo Haitang watched the fight through a video stream
      while Luo Li made tea for him.
    </p>

    <p>
      Luo Yin had not found Han Sen, but Luo Haitang believed Han Sen carried
      the blood and genetic qualities of the Luo family. As such, he
      didn&#8217;t think Han Sen had what it took to deny the allure of learning
      the Falsified-Sky Sutra.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Show me how far your practice of the Falsified-Sky Sutra has come
      along.&#8221; Luo Haitang looked at Han Sen through the video stream
      intently, earnestly hoping he would retaliate with the deadly skill.
    </p>

    <p>
      Ji Yanwu and Ji Ruozhen were watching the scene, as well, and they looked
      nervous. Although they had faith in the Falsified-Sky Sutra, they knew Yu
      Qielan had Blood Injection, and they believed the shura was devastatingly
      more powerful.
    </p>

    <p>
      The Ning family, the Qin family, the Wang family, the Dong Lin and Zhao
      families were all watching the same match. They wanted to see what path
      Han Sen had decided to follow. They wondered if he&#8217;d be more like
      Luo Haitang, doing so in a bid to impress everyone.
    </p>

    <p>
      Ji Yanran and her friends were extremely anxious. They knew Han Sen was
      strong, but they were still worried. The power Yu Qielan possessed
      exceeded the possible power of an evolver by a great extent.
    </p>

    <p>
      As everyone watched with bated breath, Han Sen did not choose to dodge the
      punch. Instead, he swung a fist of his own.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen aimed for Yu Qielan&#8217;s head, electing to risk his life to
      deliver damage just as Huang Xiao had.
