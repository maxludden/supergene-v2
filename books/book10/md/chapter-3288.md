  Han Sen knew he did not have much time left. If his power was consumed too much, even if he had a way to break the world with his Super God Spirit mode, he would not have the power needed to break the world.

He needed to let his Super God Spirit mode break the world, but his power was too far depleted.

The Ultimate Egg was still reversing Han Sen’s power. It made him keep switching between the Super God Spirit mode and reverse Super God Spirit mode. When he was in reverse Super God Spirit mode, Han Sen felt its amazingness.

The Super God Spirit mode’s power was invincible. The reverse Super God Spirit mode could consume everything. It felt like the reverse Super God Spirit mode had more of a destructive power, but it was just that the powers were different.

Originally, Han Sen had greatly desired the reverse Super God Spirit mode. The Ultimate Egg’s features enabled Han Sen the chance to claim the reverse Super God Spirit mode.

Even if he was a stupid person, Han San could still learn some things about the reverse Super God Spirit mode. Han Sen, however, was not stupid.

Every time the Ultimate Egg switched Han Sen’s body from the Super God Spirit mode to reverse Super God Spirit mode, he understood something more. He understood the reverse Super God Spirit mode more and more. He was pretty sure he was able to reverse the Super God Spirit mode. But to break the world with it would be a trial and a half.

The difficulties stemmed from the presence of the Ultimate Egg. Breaking the world required a balance of the main and reverse powers. There had to be equilibrium, but the Ultimate Egg kept changing the element of Han Sen’s body. In a situation such as this, Han Sen was unable to find the balance between the main and reverse powers.

Han Sen had zero confidence, but he knew he could not wait any longer. His Super God Spirit mode was weak. If this kept going on, even if he did manage to break the world, he could not do anything to combat Mirror Moon.

“Live or die, this is the moment everything hinges on.” Han Sen gnashed his teeth. When the Ultimate Egg turned his body into Super God Spirit mode, he forced a part of his power into the Super God Spirit mode’s power. It began the process of combining the main and reverse powers.

Because he already had experience with both powers, they combined very well. The two powers were like water and fire combining. The process for them to combine was smoother than Han Sen expected it to be.

Actually, it was not just because of him using the Ultimate Egg. An important reason for all of this was that Han Sen had been raising Wan’er for many years. Their powers extinguished each other. They restricted each other. That made the Super God Spirit mode get used to the reverse Super God Spirit mode’s power. At this time, it could be said that the two powers had the basic fundaments of each other and the ability to mesh well with one another.

This time, it was about feeling and learning. Otherwise, they would not combine smoothly.

It was a surprisingly smooth process for them to combine, but it did not make Han Sen relax. What came next would present him the real crisis.

It only took Ultimate Egg a few minutes to suddenly reverse Han Sen’s power. It made Han Sen’s power completely reverse.

That was the worst thing that could happen. Initially, Han Sen was forced to generate his Super God Spirit mode’s power to combine with the reverse Super God Spirit models power. The Ultimate Egg reversed the power, so the reverse Super God Spirit mode’s power became the Super God Spirit mode’s power. It forced Han Sen to cast the Super God Spirit mode’s powers, both the main and reverse versions, and make them combine again. They became two main powers combining, which made the process of breaking the world fail.

“Do it again!” Han Sen did not become depressed or angry because of the failure. This time, Han Sen was forced to cast the reverse Super God Spirit mode’s power. He combined with the Super God Spirit mode’s power.

The process was just as smooth. After a few minutes, when the Ultimate Egg flipped his powers again, Han Sen had the time of reversal calculated. At that moment, he was able to force his powers to go from the reverse Super God Spirit mode to the Super God Spirit mode.

Fortunately, Han Sen’s Super God Spirit mode was not showing any blood. If there was, he would have spilled another three liters of blood.

As he forced his powers to become Super God Spirit mode, the Ultimate Egg’s reversal of the powers was slowed down considerably. It made Han Sen’s combination of the powers fail once more.

Han Sen kept on trying, but he also kept failing

The Ultimate Egg seemed to have a mind of its own. It was like it was playing hide and seek with Han Sen. He timed the reversal powers a few times, but every time the Ultimate Egg made the switch. It would either go faster or slower. Han Sen was unable to succeed.

Han Sen’s body was becoming dimmer and dimmer. He was becoming darker than ever. He knew he was running out of time. In another 10 minutes, his body would be unable to support him in breaking the world.

Aside from keeping on trying, Han Sen had no other choice. As long as he was not dead, Han Sen did not want to give up on living.

The Ultimate Egg was like a naughty child. At least, it was like a very experienced guerrilla soldier. When the enemy approached, they fell back. When the enemy fell back, they chased. Whatever the case, it would not allow Han Sen to find the chance of combining. Zhao Ning’er and Zhao Qiu Yi watched Han Sen’s white light and gold light keep swapping. They did not know what Han Sen was doing, but they did notice that the lights on his body were starting to grow dimmer. He looked like he was there but not there. Han Sen’s situation had to be a dire one.

Zhao Ning’er frowned as she pondered all of this. She cursed her inability to help Han Sen. Zhao Qiu Yi, on the other hand, was straight-up depressed. After trying again, the Ultimate Egg missed the time to swap its power. Han Sen had a feeling he wanted to scold it, but he did not have the time to scold it.

Han Sen’s weaker feelings were becoming stronger. The Super God Spirit mode looked like it was there, but it was not there. It seemed as if it was going to sputter out and disappear.

“F*ck you! If you want to play, I will play with you back!” Han Sen was furious. He cast his power again.

This time, Han Sen did not cast the Super God Spirit mode or the reverse Super God Spirit mode. He was casting the reverse The Story of Genes, which had almost killed him before.

Boom!

After he cast the reverse The Story of Genes, Han Sen’s Super God Spirit mode broke. He was like a human nuke. There was a scary explosion.

“If you want to suck, then you can suck. If you want to play, then you can play.” Han Sen knew he could no longer survive by doing things normally.

He used the reverse The Story of Genes to blow up his spirit body. He wanted to see if the Ultimate Egg or Mirror Moon could be blown up so that he could live.

Mirror Moon absorbed Han Sen’s spirit body power. Now, Han Sen had blown up his spirit body, and Mirror Moon had absorbed the part that exploded.

Mirror Moon was a giant warehouse for spirit bodies. It burned spirits to gain power. After all of these days and nights, it was unknown how many spirits it had managed to collect.

Other people’s candles were burning shorter, but Mirror Moon was burning longer. The candle was a pure spirit power after it consumed souls.

Han Sen’s spirit body power became a part of the candle. After blowing up, it was like he was lighting up an arsenal. Mirror Moon exploded.
