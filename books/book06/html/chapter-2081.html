<h3>Chapter 2081</h3>

<p>After the Turtle light blasted through the flying xenogeneics,
scores of them fell to the ground.</p>
<p>Han Sen had shown himself to be a threat, and so a Blue Gold
Demon Bug screamed. Many of the xenogeneics under its control
turned toward Han Sen. Before Han Sen could fire off another
rocket, though, many Duke and Marquise xenogeneics were already in
front of him.</p>
<p>Han Sen used a petrifying shockwave to step back and get some
distance, turning all the xenogeneics in a five- hundred-meter
radius into stone.</p>
<p>Although he couldn’t petrify the stronger ones completely, he
slowed them enough to buy some time.</p>
<p>Pang! Pang! Pang! Pang!</p>
<p>Han Sen ran forward, unleashing petrifying shockwaves with every
footfall. They didn’t deal that much damage, but they did slow the
xenogeneics down. Wherever Han Sen went, things got quiet.</p>
<p>“Follow Han Sen!” Overbearing Teeth Duke shouted, and one
hundred Dukes raced after Han Sen. Their knives and their
swordlights were shining. They killed many of the
temporarily-petrified high-level xenogeneics.</p>
<p>They only killed the ones that were a danger to them, though.
They ignored the bulk of the xenogeneic horde, following Han Sen as
he made his way to the Blue Gold Demon Bugs.</p>
<p>Screams echoed in the skies as a Blue Gold Demon Bug commanded
its xenogeneics to summon more power to stop Han Sen’s advance. The
Duke and Marquise xenogeneics under its control released their
power in a single, concentrated burst.</p>
<p>Han Sen saw the attack coming, and he knew he couldn’t block it.
Overbearing Teeth had seen what was happening, too, and he barked,
“Careful!”</p>
<p>Han Sen flapped his dragon wings and disappeared, and that
frightening attack cratered the place he had been only moments
before. Han Sen reappeared right beside the Blue Gold Demon Bugs.
He used another petrifying shockwave, and the nearby Blue Gold
Demon Bugs and xenogeneics were turned to stone. Han Sen followed
that up by immediately firing a rocket. Turtle symbols appeared on
all the bugs and xenogeneics, sending them plummeting to the earth
below.</p>
<p>Overbearing Teeth grinned and began killing the bugs that were
petrified by the Turtle light. Metallic limbs and gore were strewn
everywhere in his wake.</p>
<p>The Blue Gold Demon Bugs were weaker after suffering the
petrification and Turtle spell. They could not fight back against
the Dukes. The bugs had once been difficult to kill, but now they
were slain with ease.</p>
<p>Han Sen teleported back and forth across the battlefield. Every
time he appeared, a new shockwave would roll out to petrify all
their opponents. He also made frequent use of his rocket
launcher.</p>
<p>Many Blue Gold Demon Bugs had to endure the petrification and
Turtle effects. Overbearing Teeth Duke followed Han Sen closing,
cutting up the enemies he left behind. They killed so many bugs,
making their cries drown out the sound of all else.</p>
<p>Now the bugs felt that they were facing a real threat, and they
recalled many of the xenogeneics they had sent across the city. The
new enemy troops intensified the pressure on Han Sen and the
others, but the rest of the city instantly became safer.</p>
<p>Han Sen’s power was at a level where it would still be very
difficult for him to kill the high-class bugs. Killing a Duke would
not be easy for him.</p>
<p>But he was happy to leave the killing to others. He chose to
play smart, focusing on speed, teleportation, petrification
shockwave casting, and the rockets that dished out Turtle spells.
He flashed around the battlefield, letting Overbearing Teeth Duke
and the others finish off the foes he brought down.</p>
<p>Han Sen was guiding a regiment of one hundred Dukes. They were
like a weapon of his own—one that could brutally impale the hearts
of all the enemies he came across. Many Blue Gold Demon Bugs died
by their hands, and there was little chance of the ones remaining
having a chance of escape.</p>
<p>Han Sen flowed between the monsters like water. The petrifying
shockwaves continued to spread, peppered with the explosions of the
rockets he fired. They were the brightest things on the
battlefield.</p>
<p>Wherever Han Sen went, the Dukes killed everything in their
path. Blood and bodies were everywhere, and the attacks of the bugs
were slowing down.</p>
<p>“No wonder Han Sen was able to kill Sharon and Dragon Thirteen!
That guy is scary.” said a shocked voice.</p>
<p>Rebecca and Du Lishe were in shock, too. The city was getting
quieter, and they saw that the hope of victory was not too far
away.</p>
<p>“Kill! Kill! Kill! Kill!”</p>
<p>Han Sen was like the conductor of an orchestra. His entire body
was the wild baton used for dictation, and wherever he went, death
followed.</p>
<p>Han Sen lost track of how long he had been leading the killing.
Many Blue Gold Demon Bugs were slain by the Dukes he led. And
before long, the xenogeneics started to run.</p>
<p>The only bad thing about all this was the fact that he had been
striking the monsters with rockets all that time, and the only
kills he had registered to himself were those of the lower level
foes. The Dukes had killed all the high-level enemies. Due to his
lack of kills, Han Sen had been robbed of the chance to procure
high-class beast souls.</p>
<p>But given how dire the situation had gotten, Han Sen couldn’t be
too upset about it. He disabled the Blue Gold Demon Bugs as quickly
as he could. Countless numbers of them died every second, and with
that focus, he hardly had the time to think, anyway.</p>
<p>The moonlight was bright like snow. He killed creatures without
thinking.</p>
<p>The entire planet became a killing hell. Blood was spilled
across the place, and limbs were scattered everywhere. The bodies
of xenogeneics built up like mountain ranges.</p>
<p>The fights out in space were still going on, too. Han Sen heard
a familiar voice come from the cosmos before long, breaking through
the atmosphere. It was a voice that sounded like the roaring of an
angry monster, and it slammed into a blue light. That blue light
fell like a meteor covered in purple air.</p>
<p>Boom!</p>
<p>The ground shook, and nearby hills were leveled. The blue light
erupted like a volcano from the mountain.</p>
<p>Yisha’s body sundered the atmosphere before that mountain. Her
pretty face had turned to one scored with a lust for murder. She
held a long white knife, drenched in purple air. When her hand
moved, it was like she was tearing a hole in the universe
itself.</p>
<p>Boom!</p>
<p>There was a deafening noise. The ground was scarred with a
knifemark that went on for a few hundred miles. That blue light
began to crack, but it made some marks that resembled a
chrysanthemum.</p>
<p>Yisha’s face looked cold, and her attacks made the skies above
her shudder. Onlookers began to worry that she might end up cutting
the planet in half.</p>
<p>Katcha!</p>
<p>There was a strange noise, as if something had broken.</p>
<p>Within the haze of dust and debris, Han Sen saw two blue lights
falling away from each other. When he looked closer, he saw that
the half-deified Blue Gold Demon Bug had been hewn in two by
Yisha.</p>
<p>Its body had been riddled with a number of wounds, but the
deadliest sliced from its shoulder to its waist. That was the
strike that cut the beast in half.</p>
