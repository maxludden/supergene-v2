<p>Han Sen thought there was too much that could not be explained.
If the spirits were composed of the God Spirits Sacred Leader tried
to replicate, why did the spirits have a true body that could not
be exterminated?</p>
<p>There were some other muddy details that Han Sen couldn’t quite
fit into the jigsaw puzzle. Now, Han Sen was having a hard time
trying to think.</p>
<p>“It is a shame Extreme King Alpha is dead. If he wasn’t, I could
grab him and ask him about the undead. Perhaps only then I would
learn the truth” Han Sen sighed.</p>
<p>Han Sen looked at the fighters battling the undead with a
conflicted expression. Although Bai Wei was not particularly
outstanding, every hit she made was beneficial. Han Sen could tell
Bai Wei was keeping her power in check too. She wasn’t showing all
she had yet.</p>
<p>“It looks like going to the Very High to become a silkworm aided
Bai Wei a great deal. I am afraid with all these royals, Bai
Wuchang could not even beat Bai Wei.” Han Sen sighed. He thought
since the Very High were so strong, it had not taken much time for
Bai Wei to grow so much.</p>
<p>If this kept going, Bai Wei could certainly become a true
god.</p>
<p>It was a shame that Extreme King would not give whoever became a
silkworm the throne. If that was not true, the Extreme King might
have ended up with their first queen.</p>
<p>The undead was powerful. Bai Wanjie and the others fought it
alone, but they were unable to defeat it. Now, with the five of
them fighting it together, they were able to slay the undead.</p>
<p>“Killed high-level undead.” The electric voice boomed through
the temple.</p>
<p>After killing their enemy this time, no bridge arose from the
sea.</p>
<p>“Have we made it through Starter King’s Land?” Han Sen looked
out across the misty sea. He did not see any other islands
around.</p>
<p>Bai Wanjie and the five people fighting the undead stayed inside
the blue temple. They were practicing their geno arts and combat
skills.</p>
<p>In the beginning, it took three people to defeat one undead. As
time went by, they learned more about the undead and improved
themselves. After two days, Bai Wuchang could defeat the undead
alone.</p>
<p>Boom! Boom! Boom! Another bridge appeared across the sea. Han
Sen quickly understood what it meant. “It looks like an undead must
be defeated solo to trigger the bridge that leads to another
island.”</p>
<p>Bai Wuchang did not hesitate. He walked across the bridge.</p>
<p>Bai Lingshang and Bai Wanjie looked at each other and
followed.</p>
<p>Bai Wei was going to step on the bridge when Prince Qingxia
suddenly said, “My power is not enough to solo the blue temple’s
undead. I am not going to keep going. You guys should be
careful.”</p>
<p>“Thank you, Brother.” Bai Wei bowed and walked across the
bridge.</p>
<p>Han Sen followed her across the bridge. Bai Wei turned around.
She looked at Han Sen and said, “The next temple must be very
dangerous. I suggest you do not proceed.”</p>
<p>“Don’t you worry. I can protect myself.” Han Sen laughed.</p>
<p>Bai Wei wished to say something, but Bai Wanjie, who was in
front of her, said, “Sister, you do not need to stop him. If he
does not come with us, he will probably be unable to report to
Father.”</p>
<p>Bai Wei was surprised. She understood something but did not say
anything. She kept going.</p>
<p>Han Sen shrugged his shoulders. He continued to follow them.</p>
<p>Bai Wanjie knew that Bai King had sent him there. Otherwise, he
would have just been an outsider xenogeneic student. There was no
other way to explain why he was allowed to go to the Starter King’s
Land.</p>
<p>The few of them kept going forward. It was not long before they
reached an island. This one was surprising. The island did not
possess a temple. It only had an empty volcano.</p>
<p>“Weird. Why is there no temple? Does the practice in Starter
King’s Land only cover high-level enemies?” Bai Wuchang
frowned.</p>
<p>“If things were like that, there is no way so many princes and
princesses would have died through the years,” Bai Wanjie said as
he began ascending the stairs.</p>
<p>Everyone followed him. They walked toward the peak. They
discovered it was a circular mountain that looked like a volcano.
The peak was a giant, cylindrical hole.</p>
<p>“What is this?” Bai Wuchang stood at the edge of the mountain.
He looked down with surprise.</p>
<p>Han Sen and the others looked down too. Inside the big hole were
all sorts of crystal tools. It made the whole inside of the
mountain look like a giant laboratory.</p>
<p>There was an entrance in the center of the mountain. An
egg-shaped crystal was dangling by it. It looked like some giant
creature egg. It was at least 3 feet wide.</p>
<p>There was a girl curled up inside the crystal egg.</p>
<p>“Wan’er…” When Han Sen saw the girl inside the crystal egg, his
face changed.</p>
<p>The girl had blonde hair and was wearing white pajamas. She
looked like she was sleeping. She looked like a blonde Wan’er.</p>
<p>Han Sen’s heart waved like a mad sea. His thoughts were a mess.
He did not understand what was going on. Why did Wan’er reside in
the Extreme King’s Starter King’s Land?</p>
<p>“What is going on here?” Han Sen subconsciously looked at Wan’er
inside Destiny’s Tower. He then glanced at the lady inside the
crystal.</p>
<p>They were the same. There was nothing that was not the same.
They looked like a copy-and-paste entity.</p>
<p>“What is inside this black egg that is below?” Bai Wuchang asked
as he stared at the crystal egg. “It cannot be another high-level
undead.”</p>
<p>When Han Sen heard him, he was shocked. He looked at Bai Wuchang
and thought, “Is this guy color blind? There’s no way he is that
blind and cannot tell the difference between black and white.”</p>
<p>“I don’t know,” Bai Lingshang said. “Maybe we can try to break
this big black egg to see if there is an undead inside.”</p>
<p>Han Sen was shocked and thought, “What is going on? Do they all
see a big, black egg and not a giant crystal?”</p>
