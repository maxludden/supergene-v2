<p>Han Sen used his Stone Cow body to rush forward. The shockwaves
came thick and fast from his feet.</p>
<p>Dragon Nineteen, Dragon Fifteen, and Long Ying were up front.
Dragon Nineteen did not expect this, and so she had no time to
block. She was the first to be struck by the wave of petrification,
and she turned to stone in an instant.</p>
<p>Dragon Fifteen and Long Ying were able to quickly evade it. They
struck that petrification wave with their Dragon presence. It did
little to stop the wave, though, and they felt their bodies begin
turning to stone.</p>
<p>Seeing them get petrified, Han Sen started to feel rather cocky.
But suddenly, there came a roar. One of the Dragon guards was
shining. He created a halo which quickly disabled the active
petrification wave.</p>
<p>“Damn! There is a geno art to remove petrification?” Han Sen’s
stomach sank, and he stopped using his Stone Cow body, which was
too slow.</p>
<p>He revealed his true self, drawing his Blood Feather Knife as he
ran for the exit.</p>
<p>The few Dragon Dukes on guard leapt forward. They all cast their
Dragon powers and ran towards him.</p>
<p>“That is Han Sen! Kill him!” Dragon Fifteen yelled in fury. He
became a xenogeneic and jumped towards Han Sen.</p>
<p>Long Ying was even faster than he was, though, and her spear was
fast approaching Han Sen from behind.</p>
<p>Han Sen looked unconcerned. Two small blood-red wings appeared
on his ears, and giant dragon wings sprouted from his back. His
body turned dark red. He looked more like a dragon than Dragon
Fifteen did. And on top of that, he had become far stronger.</p>
<p>“Whoever gets in my way will die.” Han Sen clutched his Blood
Feather Knife and raced towards the Duke Dragons. He did not care
about Long Ying and Dragon Fifteen’s powers.</p>
<p>As the Dragon presences and the lance converged on Han Sen, he
simply flapped his wings and disappeared.</p>
<p>The scary Dragon presences ended up hitting Long Ying’s lance,
which created an explosion and a shockwave that sent her and the
Dukes stumbling back.</p>
<p>Han Sen was in front of the Duke guards now. His knife
immediately slashed towards one of the Dukes with a knife air that
looked like a purple fang.</p>
<p>The Duke was still reeling from the shockwave, so he used his
lance to try to block the strike.</p>
<p>Dong!</p>
<p>The Blood Feather Knife broke through the Duke’s lance and
plunged into his chest. It broke the bones and ravaged the exposed
organs.</p>
<p>Han Sen moved quickly towards the gateway out of Return Ruin
Sea. Dragon Fifteen and the others chased after him, as all the
Dukes collected their power and sent it toward him. It was a wild
storm on his heels.</p>
<p>Han Sen kept flashing, using Break Space Flash to teleport a
hundred meters at a time. He dodged the attacks while swinging his
Blood Feather Knife. Many knife silks were weaved in his wake.</p>
<p>“Argh!” The Duke in the lead came into contact with the first
knife silk. He moved too quickly, and the momentum tore his body in
half across the silk.</p>
<p>Han Sen was still feeling cocky. The half-deified Blood Feather
Knife’s knife silks were far stronger than his usual work. They
could cut the body of a Duke with ease. And while that Duke might
have been clumsy enough to allow that to happen, it was still an
impressive surprise.</p>
<p>But before Han Sen could revel in his happiness, many more
Dragons and xenogeneics appeared through the gateway. He hadn’t
expected there to be so many Dragons immediately outside Return
Ruin Sea.</p>
<p>Seeing this, he knew he would have to kill if he wanted to get
out. He used his powers like crazy, diving into the crowd of
xenogeneics with his Blood Feather Knife.</p>
<p>“Han Sen! This is the day you die!” Dragon Fifteen turned into a
xenogeneic and continued the chase. He held his lance like a drill,
spinning through the air as he came.</p>
<p>“The sky is in my hands! You are just a doll. How dare you say
that.” Han Sen followed the whims of his knife, casting his skills
to the best of his abilities. As he went, he also employed Heavenly
Go and the Dongxuan Sutra.</p>
<p>Blergh!</p>
<p>He moved like a mountain spring!</p>
<p>Han Sen’s body was very strong. Wherever he went, knifelights
were cast, and there was a ceaseless spraying of blood. Limbs were
lopped and scattered all about.</p>
<p>Xius saw Han Sen killing thousands of xenogeneics and Nobles.
She witnessed his red body repeatedly flash as the stream of blood
became a raging river. Dragon Dukes and even pure Dragons like
Dragon Fifteen were unable to bring him harm.</p>
<p>Dragon Fifteen was in the fight, but Xius was out of it. With a
look of absolute shock, she watched Han Sen battle the horde of
xenogeneics.</p>
<p>Normally, she would think Han Sen was weaker than the Dukes.
He’d appear far inferior to them.</p>
<p>But with what she was seeing now, she knew he wasn’t. And she
noticed Dragon Fifteen just following Han Sen’s blade like a
puppet. Wherever Han Sen went, the others were being dragged. They
all did things far slower than Han Sen did.</p>
<p>The feelings elicited were scary. It made Xius’ scalp feel numb,
as a chill ran through her heart.</p>
<p>“Those who follow Under the Sky’s path are all dolls.” The words
popped into Xius’ head, and she had no idea where they came
from.</p>
<p>“Scary man. No wonder he was able to kill Sharon. His
knifeskills are way beyond his level,” Xius said to herself.</p>
<p>The mountains and the rivers were dyed with blood, all because
of the knife not being in its scabbard.</p>
<p>Han Sen fought for a thousand miles, and wherever he went,
Dragons came for him. And on and on, they kept on coming. Han Sen
was soaked in blood, and severed heads bounced around his feet.</p>
<p>The invisible knifeskills he employed had taken many lives that
were airborne, even. But even so, the xenogeneics continued coming
for him.</p>
<p>“Han Sen! If I don’t kill you today, I won’t be a Dragon.”
Dragon Fifteen was so mad, his Dragon body came flying forward. The
lance was like a needle, and it came spinning towards Han Sen.</p>
<p>Han Sen swung his Blood Feather Knife, and the knifeskill and
the lance collided. The knife air was broken.</p>
<p>Long Ying was like a flying dragon. Her lance was like a raging
beast. Han Sen flapped his wings and evaded her strike.</p>
<p>If he didn’t have Break Space Flash, he was sure to have been
hurt. The power Sharon wielded was too incredible, and Han Sen
wouldn’t have been able to kill him without super god spirit. He
would have been the one to die.</p>
<p>Countless bones snapped and streams of blood ran everywhere. Han
Sen killed across tens of thousands of miles, but there were still
many xenogeneics coming for him. He wouldn’t be able to kill them
all.</p>
<p>The Dragon were a famous high race of that universe, and they
deserved their reputation.</p>
<p>“Han Sen, a grand mistake you have made, making an enemy of the
Dragon.” A new, scary Dragon flew down to the battleground.</p>
<p>“Big Brother!” Dragon Fifteen screamed excitedly.</p>
<p>Han Sen was shocked. The leader of the Dragon, Dragon One, had
come.</p>
