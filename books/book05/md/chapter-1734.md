  Little Angel and Golden Growler ran towards the officer. With one hand, though, he was able to latch onto Little Angel’s sword. His other hand grabbed Golden Growler’s face.

His hand bit into the angelic sword, while Golden Growler was sent flying away with missing chunks of flesh.

Gu Qingcheng and Stay Up Late attacked the officer, but nothing they tried worked. The officer’s powers were too much, and they far exceeded what should have been possible inside the parameters of the sanctuary. The scary presence was something tangible, in itself.

Boom!

The black vortex in the sky became bigger. The dragon-like talons were emerging from the pit. The body of a monster began to emerge.

It had red eyes and it was covered with scales. The creature was rank with the smell of blood, and only seeing half of the beast was scary enough.

Roar!

The beast loosed a murderous roar. It generated a shockwave across the galaxy, breaking meteors. The planet itself was damaged.

“We can’t let that thing in! Although the sanctuary has its own protocol and system to kick that being out, it’ll take a little time. And that monster will only require one hit to wipe out the entire Alliance,” Stay Up Late said.

“How do we stop it?” Gu Qingcheng looked glum. She was wounded, but she was still standing.

“We have to kill him and close the gate.” Stay Up Late gritted his teeth.

“Of course we will!” Xie Qing King’s silver light surrounded his fists. He discharged it against the officer, but the armor was able to swallow it. The attack didn’t yield any damage at all.

The crystal shoes brought Ji Yanran into the air, throwing a kick against the officer.

The officer swung his hand and blocked the attack of the crystal shoes. The mouths on the armor were able to bite right into the crystal armor, ripping out a whole glistening chunk.

The officer punched towards Ji Yanran’s belly, but all of a sudden, there was a golden light. A small fist blocked the strike. It was Bao’er, clad in her geno armor.

Pang!

Both of their powers exploded against each other, sending everyone rolling away.

The officer looked at Bao’er in shock, as his armor was unable to consume or eat anything of hers. Bao’er looked very angry, too. The godlight across her kept flaring as she punched the officer.

The officer’s own fists repeatedly dashed their way across Bao’er’s armor, and the constant shockwaves prohibited everyone else from getting close.

“It’s too late! That thing is getting out!” Gu Qingcheng saw that the monster in the sky was pulling free of the vortex.

Pushing back the pain she was now suffering, she called out to the others.

An energy current stormed through the galaxy. Trails of electricity were everywhere, affecting all the nearby planets.

Pang!

There was a loud noise, and Bao’er’s body fell, creating a big hole in the ground.

Bao’er was still in the shape of a baby, and she couldn’t fight the officer.

This time, the officer’s body experienced a big, new change. An eye opened in the center of his forehead. Horns grew from his head as his body became wrapped in scales.

He had spliced his own genes with genes from the outside. His body was evolving into another race. He was no longer a crystallizer.

After getting rid of Bao’er, though, he followed after her. He turned to look at Littleflower, and he moved so quickly, Stay Up Late could not react.

Littleflower’s light was still shining across the entire kindergarten, with his little body hovering in mid-air. He didn’t fall back, though, and he tried using his holy light to stop the kidnapper.

Pang!

The officer broke through the holy light, ready to grab Littleflower.

But a bloodlight suddenly appeared, and it stabbed the officer. Zero flew past him, grabbing Littleflower as she sped off.

The Bone Dagger that she had used to stab the officer was swiftly consumed, though. And he hastily tried to turn and punch Zero. His fist was so strong and fast that it was far more than she was capable of evading, and she was struck in the back. She held onto Littleflower, though, as she came crashing into a building. It kicked up a storm of dust.

The officer wanted to give chase, but Stay Up Late had caught up with him. Still, whether or not the officer could be stopped was another matter entirely.

However, as the officer stood in front of the ruin, he stopped. He didn’t go inside to take Littleflower.

Gu Qingcheng looked towards the ruins and noticed a scary presence bleeding out from the rubble. A red light came bursting forth like water.

Boom!

The red light was like a volcano, and it laid waste to the ruins. Zero was holding Littleflower in the midst of the rubble. The red light was streaming from her back.

The officer squinted his eyes as he looked at Zero. He suddenly dashed before her and unleashed a strike, targetting her head.

But Zero merely stood where she was, with the red light shining on her back. It looked as if she might have been unable to move. The red light had almost reached her head, and still, she showed no reaction.

Inside Mister Tiger’s training room, swordlights kept on flashing.

Mister Tiger was very depressed. His strength and speed should have been better than Han Sen’s, but his sword could not even send a ripple through Han Sen’s clothes. Reaching past Han Sen’s sword was an impossibility, it seemed.

“You want to fight?” Mister Tiger looked annoyed and threw his sword on the ground. He thought he might have been going crazy.

Han Sen placed his practice sword back on the shelf. After fighting with Mister Tiger, he had learned some interesting things about the skills that the Kate had developed for combat.

The combat skills of Nobles like Mister Tiger were not strong. Han Sen looked like a superstar master next to them. His only disadvantage was that his body was weaker, as things currently stood.

“It’s almost time. I should get going.” Han Sen packed up his stuff, ready to leave.

Mister Tiger jumped in front of Han Sen and said, “I must say, Brother; your sword skills are obscene, but… I like them. Do you take students? I can be your student, so that you can teach me.”

Han Sen looked at Mister Tiger in shock. The Noble looked like a powerful and confident person, and Han Sen had never expected that he’d be so interested in Han Sen’s combat sword skills.

“I’m not interested in being a teacher, but I sure like money. How much would you be willing to pay, if I were to teach you?” Han Sen said. And it was true—he really did need money!

“If it’s money that you need, then that is of no concern.” Mister Tiger was very happy.
