<h2>Killing a Deified Again</h2>
<h3>Chapter 2639</h3>

<p>Han Sen used his power to restrict the Demon Abyss Beast King,
but his arrows didn’t seem to inflict any damage on the creature.
Black holes appeared and vanished all across the Demon Abyss Beast
King’s body. Whenever an arrow came close, it would be sucked into
one of those black pits, keeping the damage from reaching the Demon
Abyss Beast King. This was all within what Han Sen had expected,
though. The Demon Abyss Beast King’s power and capabilities had
been detailed in the information he had been given. Han Sen never
expected his arrows to be able to damage the Demon Abyss Beast
King. He was simply buying enough time to get closer to the
creature.</p>
<p>Finally, Han Sen got close enough to the Demon Abyss Beast King.
Han Sen spun his Six Core Snake Bow and used it like a knife. The
razor-sharp string sliced into the Demon Abyss Beast King’s scales,
leaving deep wounds across its flesh.</p>
<p>“Just as the file said. The Demon Abyss Beast King’s Demon Abyss
power can consume energy, but it cannot turn away physical damage.”
Han Sen felt calm.</p>
<p>The Demon Abyss Beast King became very angry after being struck.
Its blue light raged with greater ferocity.</p>
<p>But Han Sen attacked again and again with the Six Core Snake
Bow, flitting around the Demon Abyss Beast King like a mosquito
buzzing around a magnificent beast. No matter how loudly the Demon
Abyss Beast King roared, it couldn’t hit Han Sen. It then activated
an area attack, but the fortitude of Han Sen’s peacock king’s soul
robe was enough to shrug off all the damage. The Demon Abyss Beast
King couldn’t do anything against him.</p>
<p>Yu Kun stood to the side, doing absolutely nothing at all. He
only restricted the Demon Abyss Beast King a little bit. Han Sen
continued fighting at close range, and the Demon Abyss Beast King
was being dealt more and more wounds.</p>
<p>“What a scary guy. This moveset and those knifeskills resemble
Sky Palace’s Under the Sky. But who in our race ever practiced
Under the Sky to such a level of proficiency?” Shiya asked with
shock.</p>
<p>Zuo Yu was recording the fight between Han Sen and the Demon
Abyss Beast King. And as he continued to record it, he said, “Under
the Sky hasn’t been complete for long. Not many students have
practiced it, no. But there will eventually be more. This will be
perfect learning material.”</p>
<p>Shiya shook her head. “This isn’t something you can just watch
and learn. You need to know how to use it, and executing a skill
like this would be much harder than analyzing it. To be straight
with you, only practitioners who have already mastered the skill
could benefit from watching this. Most students wouldn’t stand any
chance of becoming as skilled as Han Sen, no matter how many times
they watched this video. Maybe it wasn’t a fluke that the Very High
test ranked him as an eleven armor talent.”</p>
<p>Zuo Yu laughed and said, “Well, having this video will be better
than nothing! I hope the Sky can develop a few elites like Han
Sen.”</p>
<p>“I don’t think we need to doubt Han Sen’s capabilities any
longer. A ninth-tier King is killing the Demon Abyss Beast King.
Although he does use two powerful treasures, Han Sen is definitely
scary. If he is a spy, he is a great danger to Sky Palace. But
right now, we still don’t know where he came from,” Shiya said.</p>
<p>“If he isn’t a spy, then we have gotten very lucky. This is our
department’s responsibility. We must confirm his identity and
political alignments,” Zuo Yu said.</p>
<p>“That is true, but the civilization of the crystallizers is long
gone. The few that remain are vagrant, interstellar travelers. We
have been looking into Han Sen’s past for some time, but after
finding the Kate, we lost the trail. Plus, the Kate’s planet has
been ravaged by war in recent years. Many of the Kate people have
lost their homes. There won’t be much left for us to learn,” Shiya
said.</p>
<p>“But we still have to do it. This investigation is our
responsibility, and the leader takes Han Sen very seriously. So, we
have to find out. With his reputation, his influence within Sky
Palace will continue to grow,” Zuo Yu said as he watched the Demon
Abyss Beast King battle Han Sen. The man’s expression was
grave.</p>
<p>A sad wail rocked the whole of the Demon Abyss. The Demon Abyss
Beast King’s head was chopped off by the Six Core Snake Bow. Demon
blood cascaded down like rain.</p>
<p>“Xenogeneic deified hunted: Demon Abyss Beast King. Xenogeneic
gene found.” As this happened, an announcement sounded inside Han
Sen’s head. When he heard no mention of a beast soul, he looked
disappointed. Yu Kun began hauling the Demon Abyss Beast King’s
body out of Demon Abyss. He couldn’t hide it from the Sky Palace
students. They could guess that Han Sen and Yu Kun had killed the
Demon Abyss Beast King together.</p>
<p>As everyone discussed Han Sen killing the deified xenogeneic, a
student found a video showing Han Sen’s performance in killing the
Demon Abyss Beast King. That video was quickly distributed all
around Sky Palace.</p>
<p>“Brother Han is using Under the Sky. That belongs to the Sky,
doesn’t it?”</p>
<p>“Under the Sky can be that powerful?”</p>
<p>“Of course it is strong. I heard Brother Han actually
contributed to its modifications.”</p>
<p>“It looks like I should start learning Under the Sky, then.”</p>
<p>“Yes, we should. When Brother Han gets back to teaching, we
should ask him.”</p>
<p>Many of the students in Sky Palace started to discuss Han Sen’s
use of Under the Sky, but after Han Sen saw the video himself, he
could only frown.</p>
<p>“It looks like Sky Palace sent someone to watch me. Otherwise,
there’s no way someone could have filmed a video like that while we
were fighting,” Han Sen said. Han Sen kept thinking. He decided to
agree to Sky Palace Leader’s request that he join the Very High for
four years. When he returned, he would be given the Constellation
Sea all for himself.</p>
<p>When Sky Palace Leader heard Han Sen’s decision, he didn’t sound
happy. He said grimly, “If you want to go, there is something
annoying you must do before your departure. You cannot leave,
otherwise.”</p>
<p>“What annoying thing?” Han Sen frowned. He had thought that
making the decision would be the difficult part. What had gone
wrong now?</p>
<p>Sky Palace Leader squinted his eyes and said, “Exquisite wanted
you to go, but you beat her and made her give up all hope. If you
want to go, you need to make Exquisite select you once more. You
will have to clean up this mess yourself.”</p>
<p>Han Sen’s mouth hung open. After a while, he said, “What is
this? If I had known, I wouldn’t have beaten her so badly.”</p>
<p>“Don’t be so depressed. Beating her might not have been a bad
thing. At least now she will look at you differently. And that
means she will hold you in higher esteem. This way, you will have
more freedom,” Sky Palace Leader said with a laugh.</p>
<p>“Can’t you send someone to apologize on my behalf?” Han Sen
asked, trying not to cringe. He had beaten her badly and forced her
to face painful realizations, all because he didn’t want to go. Now
he had changed his mind. After Han Sen thought about it some more,
he realized he might have been a bit of a cretin.</p>
<p>“You are the one who beat her. It is now up to you to change her
mind again. Otherwise, even if you somehow reached the Very High on
your own, only trouble would await you. Why not get it sorted
before you go?” Sky Palace Leader patted him on the shoulder and
went on to say, “Don’t mess this up. I have faith in you.”</p>
<p>Han Sen had no idea how to deal with this situation, but he
wanted the Constellation Sea. He had to do what Sky Palace Leader
was telling him to.</p>
