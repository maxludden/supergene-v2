      The geno core Scissor Slash was controlled by the owner’s mind. Without
      delay, it flew over to the tightening cords and attempted to snap down and
      cut the Gold Dragon Lock.
    </p>
    <p>
      Old Man Ji felt awful watching this unfold. He had hoped Han Sen would
      call back his geno core, and he expected the phantom scissors to cut
      through and break the item with ease. He thought it was a great waste.
    </p>
    <p>
      But when the teeth-laden maw of the scissors bit down on the rope, all
      that occurred was a flurry of sparks. The rope was unbroken.
    </p>
    <p>
      Green’s eyes opened wide, unsure if he was seeing things correctly. He
      could not believe the Gold Dragon Lock was able to withstand the chomp of
      those scissors.
    </p>
    <p>
      Those in the group had known each other for a number of decades, so they
      were well aware of how powerful Jia Shidao was. He had possessed Scissor
      Slash for the longest time, and they all knew how terrifying its cutting
      power was, too. The fact it could not break Han Sen’s rope was shocking.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jia Shidao’s face turned grim. He kept chomping down on his bindings
      madly, but it achieved nothing. The ferocity of his cutting generated a
      blinding firework show, but still, it was all to no avail.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was still ten minutes on the timer, and even with all that time, Han
      Sen did not think his opponent would break free. Even if he gave him an
      additional half an hour, Han Sen thought there’d be no threat.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Do you know what Han Sen’s geno core is called? It’s not a bronze geno
      core, is it? Surely it can’t be,” Zhu Donglai asked Old Man Ji, having
      been perplexed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Zhu Donglai knew it was poor form to ask what the power of someone’s geno
      core was, so he only asked for its name.
    </p>
    <p>
      Old Man Ji stroked his beard and with a stuttered chuckle, balked. “How am
      I supposed to know? Why don’t you ask him yourself?”
    </p>
    <p>
      Zhu Donglai believed Old Man Ji was lying. He thought the old man did know
      what it was, but had chosen to hide it for some reason he could not even
      guess. But Old Man Ji wasn’t telling a falsehood; he was as clueless as
      everyone else in the room, for the most part. Old Man Ji knew that Han Sen
      owned a crystal egg, but that was it.
    </p>
    <p>
      For the next three minutes, Jia Shidao frantically hacked, clamped, and
      cut at the ropes that had ensnared him, but no progress was made. As he
      realized the direness of his situation, his reddened face began to lose
      color and go pale.
    </p>
    <p>
      When Han Sen saw him stop resisting, he relaxed the lock’s grip on him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jia Shidao’s face then turned green, and with a stiff jaw said, “You have
      passed the test.”
    </p>
    <p>
      Jia Shidao quickly left the arena, and then left the area completely. He
      was far too embarrassed to remain.
    </p>
    <p>
      Old Man Ji quickly ran out and proudly pulled at Han Sen’s arms, dragging
      him over to meet his peers.
    </p>
    <p>
      Green and Zhu Donglai were very friendly to Han Sen, which was nice to
      see. And Han Sen was glad not all were as spiteful towards him as Jia
      Shidao, who had obviously been harboring a grudge of sorts. The last thing
      he wanted was to make enemies, especially amongst the demigods.
    </p>
    <p>
      The woman didn’t say anything, though. She was as stone-cold and silent as
      she had ever been. Han Sen thought it was strange to see her just there,
      and for the others to care about her so much, despite the lack of
      interaction.
    </p>
    <p>
      The woman continued to sit where she was without saying a word, like
      little more than a sculpture.
    </p>
    <p>
      After they left, Han Sen asked Old Man Ji, “Who was that woman? Is she one
      of the originals?”
    </p>
    <p>
      Old Man Ji responded, saying, “Yes, she’s an OG! But to be completely
      honest with you, even I have never heard her speak before.”
    </p>
    <p>
      Old Man Ji then had a thought that seemed to brighten his mind. With
      raised eyebrows and sly eyes, he said, “Ah! Ah! Don’t you try anything. I
      know she’s pretty, but you need to keep that thing holstered. Don’t you
      think about doing anything to her that would hurt Ji Yanran. If you upset
      her, I’ll kill you with my old bones.”
    </p>
    <p>
      Han Sen gave a wry smile and said, “What are you talking about? I was
      genuinely curious why Old Man Zhu and Mister Green seemed to admire her so
      much, despite her… not really doing much of anything.”
    </p>
    <p>
      Old Man Ji said, “She is a mystery, I’ll give you that. I know she was one
      of the very first demigods, but beyond that? Your guess is as good as
      mine. Perhaps Zhu Donglai and Green know more about who she is?”
    </p>
    <p>
      Han Sen was surprised to hear this, and he thought to himself, “She cannot
      be the woman Uncle Bug mentioned, can she?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “I now need to visit West-South System. Take the airship and return.” Old
      Man Ji walked away then, but after a few steps, stopped in his tracks.
      Then, he left a few more parting words. “Again, don’t do anything to upset
      Ji Yanran. That woman is the age of your grandmother, anyway.”
    </p>
    <p>Han Sen called after him, “What kind of person do you think I am?”</p>
    <p>
      Old Man Ji laughed on his way, but his next few words were tinged with a
      lingering concern from long ago. He said, “That woman is too pretty to be
      true, and even I was once tempted. And given the strange forces that
      govern her mystic behavior, there’s even the chance you’ll never see her
      again.”
    </p>
    <p>After that, Old Man Ji embarked and his ship took off.</p>
    <p>
      Han Sen understood Old Man Ji’s worry. The woman was very weird, and she
      certainly wasn’t some pretty girl you’d find at the cafe. Everyone knew to
      exercise caution when in her presence.
    </p>
    <p>
      Han Sen could only take public transportation home, and since there were
      none available for the time being, he decided to relax in his hotel room.
    </p>
    <p>
      Han Sen entered the sanctuary while there, to check up on Dragon Lady.
    </p>
    <p>
      She had made a lot of friends and gathered a lot of information, which she
      promptly shared with him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Green Cow was telling the truth, it seemed. Still, there was no hiding the
      fact there were no other survivors from the expeditions into Hidden
      Valley. That was cause enough for concern.
    </p>
    <p>
      While Han Sen was chatting with Green earlier, he asked if he knew about a
      demigod called Nan Litian and Shadow Shelter.
    </p>
    <p>Strangely, he had never heard of either.</p>
    <p>
      Han Sen spoke with his friends in the sanctuary, and after a while, he
      decided to once again go back to the Alliance. He went to his room, and
      before he took his coat off, he noticed he wasn’t alone. On his sofa was a
      beautiful woman.
