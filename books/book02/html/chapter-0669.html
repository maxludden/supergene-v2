    <p>
      The super creature Li Xing Lun spoke of could command the powers of ice
      and frost. It was a big white bear that made its home someplace in the ice
      fields.
    </p>

    <p>
      According to Li Xing Lun&#8217;s observations, the giant frosty bear,
      although frighteningly large, had powers that were of a medium level on
      the super creature scale. Its speed was slow, which meant they could keep
      up with it.
    </p>

    <p>
      Because the giant frosty bear could command the powers of ice, those that
      were attacked could incur frostbite. One of the debilitations such an
      infliction brought was reduced mobility. Reduced speed and slower reaction
      times would be some of the problems they&#8217;d have to face.
    </p>

    <p>
      After Han Sen read the information gathered on the giant frosty bear, he
      deemed it something he would like to give a go. Frosty powers didn&#8217;t
      frighten him very much, after unlocking his first gene lock withJadeskin.
      Elementally, Han Sen had quite the advantage if he was to face this bear.
    </p>

    <p>
      This, in addition to the slower speed of the giant frosty bear, made it an
      ideal target. And if they failed in their task of killing it, they could
      at least fall back with relative ease.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen found himself getting a little excited after discussing the
      details with Li Xing Lun. Together, they decided to go test the bear out.
    </p>

    <p>
      When Han Sen returned to the shelter, he heard about what happened with Lu
      Hui and the master in the north&#8217;s cooperative assault against the
      wolf king. It turned out that they failed and incurred great losses in
      their struggle.
    </p>

    <p>
      Word was, they gained the upper-hand at first, and things were going
      relatively well until the sudden appearance of a legion of pegasi. They
      arrived there and aided the wolves. The cooperative human armies were
      promptly wrecked, which forced them to retreat.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;At the end of the day, it was a loss.&#8221; Han Sen sighed, as he
      had personally witnessed the capabilities of the wolf king and pegasi
      king. Han Sen didn&#8217;t want to bother them, after his previous
      experience with them, so taking on solo super creatures was his current
      preference.
    </p>

    <p>
      He found Li Xing Lun and Wang Yuhang making their preparations to go to
      the giant frosty bear.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen did not bring the silver fox with him, as he was hoping to hunt
      some sacred-blood creatures along the way.
    </p>

    <p>
      Li Xing Lun told Han Sen that there were creatures that looked like
      penguins in the area they were headed. They were really small, and if he
      was able hunt the sacred-blood variants and eat a few of them, he&#8217;d
      rack up a lot of sacred geno points in a short amount of time.
    </p>

    <p>
      The giant frosty bear lived against the ice sea. Along the coast, one
      particular part of the sea had wholly frozen over. And that was where the
      giant frosty bear tended to reside.
    </p>

    <p>
      When they arrived at the area they sought, it wasn&#8217;t long before
      they found a sacred-blood creature.
    </p>

    <p>
      They spotted it from afar, and it was a big white bird that just stood in
      one place, cleaning its feathers with its tongue. It looked like a
      red-crowned crane, but all the creatures around avoided it. They knew that
      the red-crowned crane was not something to be trifled with.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;There is no point in sharing such a creature, so how about a little
      wager? Whoever slays the bird first gets to keep the meat!&#8221; Wang
      Yuhang suggested.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Sure, that&#8217;s fine by me.&#8221; Han Sen smiled at Wang
      Yuhang.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen&#8217;s little uncle may have had terrible luck, but he enjoyed a
      good gambit. It was strange, however, for Han Sen had never seen him win.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;I&#8217;m okay with that, too.&#8221; Li Xing Lun wanted a part of
      the fun, as well. He had only just recently unlocked his gene lock, so he
      was keen to flex his newfound muscles.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Let us all form a line. On the count of three, we all rush towards
      the fiend together. After that, it will all be down to a balanced, hearty
      measurement of luck and skill.&#8221; Wang Yuhang scratched a line in the
      ice for them to assemble on.
    </p>

    <p>
      The three of them then stood in a line. After that, Wang Yuhang counted to
      three. After the count was up, Wang Yuhang and Li Xing Lun were the only
      two that started running towards the bird.
    </p>

    <p>
      In Li Xing Lun&#8217;s eyes, it looked as if the galaxy was spinning. He
      accelerated at what seemed faster than the speed of light, racing towards
      the red-crowned crane.
    </p>

    <p>
      Wang Yuhang was no slouch, either. He shouted and a light burst forth from
      within him. As this happened, his speed increased and he managed to catch
      up and trail right behind Li Xing Lun. Like two meteors, they both skated
      across the ice in a great hurry.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen slowly brought out the peacock crossbow that had just recently
      evolved. From the quiver, he loaded in a raven feather bolt. With a quick
      look at the crane, he raised his arms and pulled the trigger.
    </p>

    <p>Whoosh!</p>

    <p>
      The blacklight bolt flashed and travelled a thousand meters in the blink
      of an eye. It shot right past Li Xing Lun and Wang Yuhang and lodged
      itself in the crane&#8217;s cranium.
    </p>

    <blockquote>
      <p>
        &#8220;Sacred-Blood Creature Hunted: Snow Bird. The Beast Soul Was Not
        Acquired. Consume Its Flesh To Obtain A Random Numeric Amount Of Sacred
        Geno Points, Ranging From Zero To Ten.&#8221;
      </p>
    </blockquote>

    <p>
      The familiar notification tone rang in Han Sen&#8217;s head. He started
      laughing as he caught up to Li Xing Lun and Wang Yuhang and told them,
      &#8220;Thank you very much!&#8221;
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Holy sugar! You cheated! How can you use such an obscene weapon and
      think it was fair?&#8221; Li Xing Lun and Wang Yuhang said, exactly at the
      same time.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;There was no rule forbidding certain weaponry. You said anything
      goes; even you two could have used a crossbow, if you wanted to,&#8221;
      Han Sen said boisterously, as he packed the Snow Bird&#8217;s body into
      his backpack. He&#8217;d sort it out when he had a break.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;I was thinking of using mine, but I didn&#8217;t think it was
      strong enough. Where&#8217;d you get your crossbow? How can a weapon like
      that possess such monstrous strength?&#8221; Wang Yuhang asked, observing
      Han Sen.
    </p>

    <p>
      When they hunted the Fire-Scale T-rex, Wang Yuhang got a glimpse of the
      peacock crossbow there for the first time. He had always meant to ask more
      about it. He knew it was a powerful weapon, but he never expected it to be
      that powerful. To kill a sacred-blood creature, from a thousand meters
      away, was a frightening thing.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen then thought to himself, &#8220;Of course it&#8217;s powerful; a
      berserk super creature crossbow and super bolt tends to pack a punch. If
      it couldn&#8217;t kill a sacred-blood creature with a headshot, I&#8217;d
      just use this thing as firewood.&#8221;
    </p>

    <p>
      Wang Yuhang did not make any more gambling suggestions, aware that Han Sen
      would most likely win every wager, with that crossbow in his possession.
    </p>

    <p>
      But after that, none of the three spotted a single other sacred-blood
      creature. They spotted a group of the penguin-looking creatures that Li
      Xing Lun spoke of, and as remarkably penguin-like as they looked, they did
      not see a sacred-blood creature in their midst. Only mutant-class variants
      could be seen.
    </p>

    <p>
      The mutant geno points of the three adventurers had been maxed out, so
      there was no point hunting them. They decided to leave them for others who
      might come their way.
    </p>

    <p>
      Li Xing Lun and Wang Yuhang could only watch Han Sen dine on the
      sacred-blood Snow Bird in delight, feeling slightly spurned. They
      didn&#8217;t think it was fair, and as a result, vowed to never make
      another wager with Han Sen again.
    </p>

    <p>
      They were now drawing nearer to the place Li Xing Lun had spoken of. At
      this point, they treaded the icy wastes with greater care and caution. The
      ice was relatively thin, and the blue sea was clearly visible underfoot.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Are you sure this is the place? Why have we not yet seen the giant
      frosty bear?&#8221; Han Sen and his crew spent half the day searching but
      did not see nor hear anything that suggested the local presence of a super
      creature bear. With suspicion, Wang Yuhang had to ask Li Xing Lun about
      his intel.
    </p>

    <p>
      Just as he was going to speak, there were splashes from beneath the ice. A
      giant white creature had been swimming, and it was now returning to the
      surface with a one meter long fish in its mouth. The giant frosty bear was
      two meters away from Wang Yuhang when their eyes met.
