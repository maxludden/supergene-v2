<p>Han Sen knew the kill sky hammer’s radius of attack was scary,
but there was nothing he could do about it. That thing was very
powerful, but no one was able to control the radius of that
power.</p>
<p>Luckily, the closer to the center of the shaking point someone
was, the more shaking power there was. They were quite far away, so
the shaking power they felt was quite weak. If it was like Moment
God’s power. When facing the kill sky hammer face-to-face, one of
those attacks would have probably nearly killed Sun Moon God
Ape.</p>
<p>Moment God saw where the kill sky hammer came from. She knew
that the power of the hammer could break every other power. She
ignored Bao’er. She flashed above Golden Growler, put her hands
together really fast, and made a weird symbol. It was heading for
Golden Growler. There was a wave headed for Golden Growler, so it
opened its mouth. The gold door only exited its mouth halfway. The
door was frozen there. All of that happened in just one moment. At
the same time, Golden Growler stopped moving. Moment God flashed
away. She dodged Bai King’s knife sword, which was crazily
slashing. She appeared in front of Han Sen. She carried the time
light. Her hand was reaching out for Han Sen’s light scissors.</p>
<p>Han Sen knew Moment Goddess was afraid of the golden door that
came out of Golden Growler’s mouth. Even if her power could not
kill Golden Growler, it could trap it. If she could kill him, she
would have done it already.</p>
<p>Moment God moved to take the light scissors away so that Golden
Growler could not be set free again. “An Annihilation class God
Spirit is hard to deal with. I wonder how scary a Reboot class God
Spirit is.” Han Sen used the time area. The time element did not
have much of an effect on Moment God. Instead, Han Sen was affected
by Moment God’s time god power effect. His movement was very slow.
He could not dodge her and prevent her from stealing the
scissors.</p>
<p>Bao’er’s body flashed. She was suddenly above Han Sen’s head.
The hammer was striking toward Moment God’s hands.</p>
<p>“No!” Moment God had no reaction. Han Sen, Bai King, Sun Moon
God Ape, and Space Spirit screamed. Their faces looked black.</p>
<p>Earlier, Bao’er had waved her hammer a few times, which almost
shook them to death. Their bones almost cracked. Now, it was about
to come down near their bodies. It was going to kill them.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, it was too late for anything. The hammer in
Bao’er’s hand had already hit Moment God’s hand.</p>
<p>Han Sen knew this was going to be bad. He flashed backward and
raised the Shield of the Medusa’s Gaze to try and protect his
body.</p>
<p>Bai King used his spirit body to raise a shield and protect
himself as he quickly retreated.</p>
<p>Sun Moon God Ape and Space Spirit were running away as fast as
they could. Their foreheads were dripping with cold sweat.</p>
<p>Boom!</p>
<p>“Argh!” Han Sen and the others screamed. It was like a
television show in which they were blown away. The four of them
blew up, flew, and rolled away. All the God blood spilling out was
like it was for free.</p>
<p>Han Sen and Bai King were faring a little better. Only their
bones and organs were ripped. Sun Moon God Ape and Space Spirit
only had half their lives left. That was especially true of Sun
Moon God Ape. His limbs were soft, and he was twisted like a
pretzel. He was going to be disabled. “Big God, please stop shaking
me… Cough… Cough… Moment God still hasn’t touched me… Cough… Cough…
I am going to be killed by you…” Sun Moon God Ape was speaking and
throwing up blood at the same time. He was going to cry. “Shut the
hell up! You’re only a little bit hurt, yet you are crying. Are you
a 3-year-old child?” Bao’er lifted her lips. She then lifted her
finger, enabling a giant lotus light to come out of it. The petals
had a holy light. The body of Sun Moon God Ape was covered in that
holy light. The wounds were healing fast. It was at an unbelievable
speed. The lotus light was the true god beast soul Han Sen had
claimed from the Light Well Lotus. It had a powerful healing bai
sema. Han Sen had given it to Bao’er. If Bao’er was in danger, she
could use the lotus to save her life.</p>
<p>Suddenly, Sun Moon God Ape and others saw their severe wounds
healing. Sun Moon God Ape was very happy and said, “Dollar Big God,
you really can do everything.” “Stop talking crap! Give me your
time and space power!” Bao’er shouted. She was holding her little
hammer and going toward Moment God.</p>
<p>Sun Moon God Ape and Space Spirit were busy gathering their
powers. They buffed Bao’er so that she could catch up with Moment
God.</p>
<p>Boom!</p>
<p>The power of the kill sky hammer struck Moment God’s time god
power again. Bao’er used her kill sky hammer to fight Moment God
face-to-face and not lose. It was bad for Sun Moon God Ape.
Although there was the Light Well Lotus healing bai sema for
protection, the bai sema could only heal. It could not block the
damage.</p>
<p>Sun Moon God Ape was being shaken again. Everyone was spitting
out blood and healing. Their bones broke and healed and healed and
broke. Their organs ripped and healed and healed and ripped. It was
like they were suffering absolute torture. It felt absolutely
awful.</p>
<p>“Dollar Big God really is the strongest in the universe. He can
fight Moment God without losing.” “Dollar Big God is so overbearing
and strong. Go and kill Moment God and bring the creatures of the
universe some dignity.”</p>
<p>“Dollar Big God is invincible.” The creatures from every race
started to speak like Sun Moon God Ape. They added the two words
after every mention of Dollar’s name. No one thought it was an
unworthy title.</p>
<p>Most of the creatures in the universe thought Dollar was the big
universe’s first strongest elite. The other true gods were too weak
before Dollar. Calling him a big god was to separate him from other
elites.</p>
<p>“Interesting.” Human King squinted his eyes. He watched Bao’er
battle Moment God. His eyes looked weird for a second.</p>
<p>The red-clothed woman stood behind him and said, “I think this
Dollar has an even higher chance of breaking that level, yet Han
Jinzhi wants us to assist Han Sen. Are you sure he is not just
showing bias?”</p>
<p>Human King laughed and said, “Dollar is strong, but he is
depending on his god personality armament. He has the evil lotus
bai sema and sky bone knife armor too. That hammer, if I am not
mistaken, is Kill Sky God’s god personality armament. I bet Kill
Sky God descended to kill him, and he killed him. That is how he
got that Annihilation class god personality armament.”</p>
<p>“Kill Sky God possessed someone and descended?” the red-clothed
woman asked. “It would have been so much weaker. Even so, killing
Kill Sky God would have been an almighty task. He did not have the
kill sky hammer at the time.”</p>
<p>Human King nodded and said, “This kid is very rare. I do not
know who created this monster. His genes are complex. They are more
complex than a creature from the sanctuaries.”</p>
<p>While everyone was talking, Han Sen approached Golden Growler
with his light scissors. He knew Bao’er did not have much time. He
had to finish the fight to save Golden Growler.</p>
<p>In that massive fight, Bao’er might not have been able to last
an hour before she spent all her power.</p>
