Seeing Zhao Ning’er turned into a white god bird. As she approached the gene egg, she suddenly saw a knife air rise up not too far from the coast. It suddenly slashed in front of Bury Path God to almost hit the gene egg.

Bury Path God looked into the sky and put the gene egg away. His other hand became a fist that was thrown forward in a punch to hit the sword air.

*Boom!*

The punching power hit the sword air. Bury Path God’s body was shaken backward. The power created a shockwave. It created a large wave in the sea like chains.

Zhao Ning’er was now a white god bird, and the clarity of her actions was improved. She flew toward Zhao Qiu Yi.

Zhao Qiu Yi was both shocked and happy. She looked to where the sword air had come from. She saw a man arrive via the beach. It was Han Sen, who she had previously let go.

“Han Sen, how dare you come back!” Bury Path God pulled his fist back. He looked at Han Sen as he spoke. “I never left, so I am not coming back.” Han Sen continued stepping forward. His sword air became more and more powerful. His sword mind became stronger with every step closer he took.

Bury Path God did not move. He looked at Zhao Ning’er, who had become a white god bird. He said, “If you did not leave, then stay.”

After that, Bury Path God exploded. The gene egg in his right hand glowed. It was like a sun shining brightly through the sky and across the earth. The god bird shadow of the gene egg exploded. One bird sound shocked the sky and the ground.

Zhao Ning’er had almost reached Zhao Qiu Yi’s position through flight. When she heard that bird sound, though, her body shook. She was unable to control herself. She flapped her wings and flew toward the gene egg again. Han Sen frowned. He moved 10 fingers and became a sword air, messily headed for Bury Path God.

“No one can stop her from becoming a Break World beast,” Bury Path God coldly said. The space around him started to fall. When Han Sen’s sword air came close, it got stuck in it. It became buried in the fallen space. Nothing could be done about it.

Zhao Ning’er, who was a white god bird, flew very fast. Seeing she was about to reach the gene egg that looked like a glowing sun, Zhao Qiu Yi looked antsy and angry. She did not care for her own well-being as she raced into the sky after her sister. She was not as fast as Zhao Ning’er, who had now transformed to become a white god bird. She was unable to catch up with her.

Han Sen looked at Bury Path God. He drew his Inch Grey Sword. Dongxuan Sutra’s Break World power gathered atop the blade of the Inch Grey Sword. The sword was like a light as it was wielded.

The sword light went across the space in front of Bury Path God. The fallen space was cut open by the sword light. Bury Path God’s body flickered. Although he was able to dodge the sword light, the clothes across his chest were given a long swipe. It revealed his naked chest and the slight brush of a sword that had swept across it.

“It is no wonder why this is the old leader’s sword.” Bury Path God’s face did not change. He complimented the Inch Grey Sword, but he never talked about Han Sen’s sword skills. It was as if Han Sen was not worthy of praise.

Han Sen did not care for the snub. He grabbed Zhao Ning’er, who was now a white god bird, and pulled her away.

Bury Path God extended one of his fingers to stroke the wound across his chest. His wound was healed by that finger as if he had simply zipped his skin up.

Bury Path God said, “You are not bad. It is a shame she already has the mark of the God Chaos Party. No one will be able to prevent her from becoming a Break World beast.” He placed the gene egg out in front of him.

The gene egg’s light became dimmer. Han Sen saw that the fire inside the gene egg was like a burning white candle.

Because of the burning, the white candle itself had almost completely gone away. With Bury Path God’s power, the little bit of candle left was burnt. The gene egg’s flame was put out. At the same time, Zhao Ning’er, who had been grabbed by Han Sen and had a white god bird body, collapsed. She turned into white dots and flew toward the gene egg. Han Sen frowned. He could not stop anything from happening.

When the white dots went into the gene egg, the gene egg lit up. The white light generated a god bird that looked like a phoenix.

Katcha!

The god bird was formed. The gene egg’s crystal-like shell was shattered. A white god bird phoenix flew out of it, spreading its wings. Its presence was very scary.

The sound of a bird ripped space. Scary shockwaves went across the planet. Everything that touched the shockwave became dust. Even the sea turned into a sea of sand.

“It worked!” Bury Path God was happy about that. He reached out his hand and grabbed the neck of the white god bird. When Bury Path God tightened his hands, the body of the white god bird burned. It changed, giving it the head of a harp.

“Han Sen, it is your lucky day. You have been able to witness the birth of a Break World beast. I will let you try this asking heart phoenix head harp.” Bury Path God held the phoenix head harp. He placed his fingers on the strings and started to play it.

Bzzt!

The sonic powers came out from the harp. The harp only produced one sound. In Han Sen’s ears, it was like countless God Spirits were screaming at him.

“Does God exist? Is Han Jinzhi my great-grandad? What does Qin Xiu want?” The voice was his. It was interrogations from the deepest reaches of his soul. The many questions Han Sen wanted answered did not even have an answer. The questions and desires were dredged up by the godly sounds. They echoed through his head like thunder. It was getting louder and louder. It was almost enough to make him deaf.

Han Sen noticed he could no longer move. He was turning to dust. His skin started to look like sand.

The power of the Blood-Pulse Sutra could not prohibit his body from changing.

Han Sen used the Dongxuan Sutra to change the rules of the power. He was barely able to block the sonic power. He could not stop the sounds of the harp.

The sounds of the harp tortured his heart. They kept corroding his heart. They corroded the Dongxuan Sutra.

Han Sen knew this was not because the Dongxuan Sutra was weak. It was just that his Break World powers weren’t enough. His Dongxuan Sutra had only just managed to break the world. The phoenix head harp’s power was above the Break World materialization and level. It was a higher level than a demon god sword. It was two levels higher than the Dongxuan Sutra.

The Dongxuan Sutra could usually go against something higher than it. It could temporarily block the phoenix sound, so it was already powerful “A Break World beast is so strong when it becomes a Break World weapon. A Break World beast has only just been created, yet the power is like a level-three elite. If…” Bury Path God’s eyes looked excited. He looked at Han Sen, suffering in his enduring of the harp’s power. It prompted Bury Path God to coldly say, “Dying at the hands of a Break World weapon means you are lucky, so just die!”

While he was talking, Bury Path God played his harp again.

This time, he plucked more than just one string. He plucked a few of them. Scary shockwaves went everywhere, covering the sky and ground around Han Sen.
