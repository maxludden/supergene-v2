<h3>Chapter 2986</h3>

<p>Han Sen was in Super God Spirit mode. That scary power went
through his semi-transparent body and did not do anything to
him.</p>
<p>Han Sen was holding the Sky Vine Radish God Lance. He teleported
in front of Kill Sky God and struck his head again. He had to act
very quickly since Wan’er would not last long</p>
<p>Dong!</p>
<p>The Sky Vine Radish God Lance carried the power of Super Spank
and struck Kill Sky God’s neck. The tip of the lance plunged into
his muscles and dug in a few inches before it was unable to go any
further.</p>
<p>Han Sen had selected a location that had no armor for
protection. If he struck the armor, the result would have likely
been unfavorable.</p>
<p>Kill Sky God’s eyes flickered with god light, but he could not
dodge Han Sen’s strike. The god hammer in his hand kept on
swinging. Against the Super God Spirit body, it was useless.</p>
<p>Han Sen’s Sky Vine Radish God Lance kept on attacking. It hit
the same wound that had already been inflicted upon Kill Sky God.
He wanted to continuously strike the same spot and sever his
neck.</p>
<p>Han Sen quickly discovered that the speed of his wound ripping
was not as fast as Kill Sky God’s wound healing. His repeated
attacks did not accomplish much. Before the second lance reached
that spot, Kill Sky God’s wound released some god light and was
almost healed.</p>
<p>“My power really isn’t enough to kill an Annihilation class God
Spirit.” Han Sen frowned. He was in a bit of a rush.</p>
<p>Destiny’s Tower Wan’er was getting worse. She was almost going
to wake up. The only thing that made Han Sen happy was the fact
that Destiny’s Tower was being shaken by Kill Sky God’s scary power
and wasn’t breaking. It did not even get damaged. It was just the
power that made it keep bouncing around everywhere. It was moving
further away from the battleground. Moaning sounds were heard from
someplace within the tower. It sounded as if it was going to crack
any second. It was uncertain how long it would last.</p>
<p>“If I had not borrowed a body and pushed my power to the max by
using the strongest god skill, you would have been killed by now
already!” Kill Sky God looked at Han Sen coldly. The big hammer in
his hand did not keep attacking. He allowed Han Sen’s Sky Vine
Radish God Lance to keep striking him, but he was still unable to
inflict deadly, fatal wounds on him.</p>
<p>“Even if I cannot make use of all my power, you cannot damage my
God Spirit body. Let’s see how long you can keep it up. Once your
power has been exhausted, it will be time for me to kill you.” Kill
Sky God’s voice was so cold that it made one feel a chill deep in
their bones.</p>
<p>Han Sen did not know how long his Super God Spirit mode will
last. This was the first time he had used Super God Spirit mode as
a true god. For now, he did not feel uncomfortable or anything.</p>
<p>It was similar to Wan’er not disturbing him. Super God Spirit
mode should have lasted a long time. If Han Sen wanted to leave,
Kill Sky God could not stop him.</p>
<p>If he left now, Wan’er would be done for. If he brought Wan’er
with him, the Super God Spirit mode would be gone. That would have
made it impossible to flee.</p>
<p>Unless it was absolutely necessary, Han Sen would not give up
Wan’er. Besides the fact that he had been taking Wan’er with him
for very long, even if it was a dog, he would feel emotion toward
it.</p>
<p>Plus, there were many secrets regarding Wan’er that he had yet
learned. Han Sen had also enjoyed three drinks with Qin Xiu and
promised him he would take care of Wan’er. He could not just back
out now.</p>
<p>“With things becoming like this, I cannot care too much. I will
have to use the Holy Kirin’s holy spirit to get out of this.” Han
Sen had no other choice.</p>
<p>Han Sen knew Kill Sky God’s real power was not as invincible as
he was making it out to be. When his body landed, he did not have
an absolute suppress power. Otherwise, Sky Vine Radish God Lance
would not have hurt him. His god skills made his body stronger than
a true god class elite. Even with a buff off a god skill, he would
have been unable to destroy his body with the Sky Vine Radish God
Lance.</p>
<p>If he had a buff from the Holy Kirin’s holy spirit, there was a
chance of success. If he used the Holy Kirin’s holy spirit now, he
would expose the fact that Dollar was Han Sen. Fortunately, no one
knew Han Sen was human. Even if he exposed himself, the God Spirits
would not come after him for a while. As for the future, Han Sen
would just have to wait and see how it all shook out.</p>
<p>Katcha!</p>
<p>While Han Sen prepared to summon the Kirin’s holy spirit to
possess the Sky Vine Radish God Lance, he suddenly heard something
crack open far away in space. In the space around, Han Sen and Kill
Sky God’s power broke everything into dust. There was nothing left
to break.</p>
<p>Han Sen heard that sound. He thought it was terrible. He turned
around and saw Destiny’s Tower display a crack. It had probably
endured too many hits.</p>
<p>Before Han Sen reacted, a gold, holy light came out from the
crack. There was suddenly a blonde lady rising from the crack.</p>
<p>Her blonde hair was waving as much as her clothes were. Wan’er
was sleeping inside Destiny’s Tower. Now, Wan’er had become the
blonde-haired lady. Her whole body released a weird, blonde light
that made her body look like a dream. It did not look real.</p>
<p>Wan’er looked like Han Sen’s Super God Spirit mode, but it was a
bit different.</p>
<p>Wan’er’s eyes were open. Clearly, she had gotten rid of her
sleeping mode, but her gold eyes still had no focus. She was like a
zombie.</p>
<p>“Wan’er… Wan’er… Im… Impossible… How are you still alive… You
cannot still be alive…” When Kill Sky God saw the blonde Wan’er,
his face changed. It was like he had just laid eyes on a ghost.</p>
<p>Even earlier, when Han Sen hit him, he did not have this
expression. He still exhibited the pride of a God Spirit.</p>
<p>After seeing Wan’er for a brief moment, he was freaking out. Han
Sen thought it was strange how he had just lost it like this.</p>
<p>Kill Sky God recognized Wan’er, which did not make Han Sen feel
weird.</p>
<p>There was an 80% to 90% chance that Kill Sky God was one of the
God Spirits that descended way back when. It was not a surprise for
him to have seen Wan’er with the rest of Sacred. Seeing his face,
he seemed absolutely terrified of Wan’er. That made Han Sen feel
like it was unbelievable.</p>
<p>It all happened in a moment. Wan’er came out of Destiny’s Tower.
Her unfocused eyes fell on Han Sen, which made him feel a
chill.</p>
<p>Cha!</p>
<p>Wan’er’s body suddenly went blurry in front of Han Sen. With Han
Sen’s vision, he was not able to see where she moved.</p>
<p>Subconsciously, Han Sen fell back. He noticed that Wan’er was
not going after him. That pretty and soft body of hers went before
Kill Sky God. She raised her right arm without any emotion. Her
hand was like a knife slashing down from up high. The blonde hair
and gold clothes were waving as she struck.</p>
<p>Kill Sky God’s face looked shocked. His hands were holding a
giant hammer. He swung it at Wan’er as he fell back.</p>
<p>Wan’er’s hand was full of a golden flame. She continued her
downward strike. The giant hammer, which had destroyed everything,
was like tofu being cut in half by her hand.</p>
<p>Kill Sky God’s face was wretched. He was unable to completely
fall back. His face had been cut from his forehead to his jaw by
Wan’er’s fingertip. It was like the center of his face had a red
line.</p>
