<p>After the big goldfish sucked the bubble in, its butterfly-like
big tail swung. It traveled through space and swam around.</p>
<p>Han Sen and Bao’er were inside the bubble that had been sucked
into the belly of the big goldfish. Outside the bubble, everything
was completely red. It was very bright. It was like they were
inside a red mist.</p>
<p>Beyond the red mist, Han Sen slightly saw copper-looking metal
walls. The weirdest part was that the metal wall had strange
symbols and text on it. It was obviously a man-made construct.</p>
<p>Han Sen noticed that the bubble was not breaking, and the powers
of the zone were not corroding their bodies. He was attracted by
the text and symbols displayed on the metal wall. He was not in a
rush to attack just yet.</p>
<p>“Are the xenogeneics inside the big barren systems all man-made?
It is probably hard to make a true god class xenogeneic. Even a God
Spirit cannot do it. Was Sacred really that strong before?” Han Sen
was checking out the text and symbols on the metal walls.</p>
<p>Han Sen did not know what the symbols meant. The scribe was in
the universe’s common language, so he could understand it perfectly
fine.</p>
<p>“Tester No. 304…” Han Sen read it aloud. It was obviously a
number. That was all he could see.</p>
<p>Han Sen understood the words, but they meant nothing to him. The
way the words were written did surprise him.</p>
<p>He recognized the words. Back then, in the Tianxia System, Han
Sen had entered Purple Fight’s vision before jumping into the
eyesight of another woman. It was the woman who was trapped in Two
Worlds Mountain. Her handwriting was the same as the handwriting on
that metal wall.</p>
<p>“It seems like I am correct. This goldfish must be a test
subject of Sacred. The woman was a researcher for Sacred Leader.
The goldfish must be one of her test subjects.” Han Sen remembered
that inside the Black Hole Spider’s belly, he had encountered the
white tiger. It made people grow mushrooms on their heads.</p>
<p>Although he knew more about the origin of the goldfish, it was
useless information for Han Sen and Bao’er. He did not know where
the woman went. He wanted to find her and ask a bunch of questions,
but he hadn’t seen hide nor hair of her again.</p>
<p>Han Sen wanted to break the bubble and rush out, but he noticed
that the goldfish’s direction was actually the direction he wanted
to go. His heart jumped. He lessened the tightness of his fist.</p>
<p>“This fish is going in the direction I want to go to. Since we
are in its belly, there is no danger. Let’s take this for a ride.
Perhaps it can save us a lot of trouble.” After thinking about
this, Han Sen did not move.</p>
<p>Bao’er jumped down from Han Sen’s shoulders. She stepped onto
the bubble’s wall. She surfed around on the inside and was having a
lot of fun.</p>
<p>Han Sen thought it was weird. The goldfish had swallowed them,
but it had not broken the bubble. With the bubble there, the power
of the red mist was not hurting Han Sen or Bao’er. It was hard to
tell what the goldfish wanted.</p>
<p>“Does this mean the goldfish recognizes the relationship between
me and Sacred Leader? Is that why it hasn’t planned on killing us?
Does it want to take us somewhere?” After Han Sen thought of that,
he had no qualm with staying still. He did not want to kill the
fish.</p>
<p>Because they were inside the goldfish, the Dongxuan Aura was
blocked by the goldfish’s body and its own power. Han Sen had a
guess as to where the goldfish was headed, but he could not feel or
see anything regarding where they were. All he could do was wait
where he was.</p>
<p>“Did that woman go back to the big barren systems? Did she
discover that I have come here? Is that why she commanded this big
goldfish to come and collect me? Is it supposed to deliver me to
her?” Han Sen had nothing to do, so his mind kept thinking about
what the goldfish’s ultimate goal was.</p>
<p>It had been a few days, yet the goldfish had yet to stop. Han
Sen did not know where the goldfish was going, but there was one
thing that was for sure. The goldfish did not want to kill them. At
least, it didn’t want to yet. If it harbored ill desires against
Han Sen, it would not have kept the bubble active.</p>
<p>The goldfish traveled for around seven or eight days. Bao’er
thought it was getting to be a bit too boring. She could not be
bothered by playing surfing games any longer. She pulled out a
chessboard and played chess with Han Sen.</p>
<p>It was unknown how many matches the two had, but they eventually
realized the goldfish had stopped moving. The bubble with Han Sen
and Bao’er inside suddenly flew out.</p>
<p>Not long later, the goldfish spat out the bubble.</p>
<p>Han Sen looked around. He noticed he was still in the sea of
trash. Atop the trash, there was a countless number of flowers. It
was like a lovely garden in space. There was a domed building full
of fresh flowers. There was water inside it. The water came out
from the building’s gaps. The waterfalls were like descending
silver dragons. They looked absolutely gorgeous.</p>
<p>Inside the building, the water was like a lake. A smaller
goldfish was parked at the water’s edge. Its mouth was facing the
sky. Its eyes were wide open. Its tail kept swinging, making waves
in the water.</p>
<p>The bubble Han Sen and Bao’er were in headed for the little
goldfish’s mouth. It moved very swiftly.</p>
<p>Han Sen was now able to understand what was going on. With a wry
smile, he said, “It looks like I thought too much. The reason the
goldfish did not want to kill us is that he was saving us to feed
its child. This goldfish is quite professional. He knows its child
likes to eat fresh food.”</p>
<p>Seeing the bubble move closer to the mouth of the little
goldfish, Han Sen generated power. He was going to break the
bubble.</p>
<p>“Great! I can get them all at once.” Han Sen stared at the
little goldfish. He did not strike yet. He wanted to draw some
distance between him and the little goldfish. He wanted to take the
little goldfish as a hostage. The big goldfish would certainly be
afraid.</p>
<p>Although it was a small goldfish, its head was as big as a
killer whale. It would be easy for it to eat Han Sen and
Bao’er.</p>
<p>Upon seeing the face of the little goldfish, one could tell it
was quite different from the big goldfish.</p>
<p>The big goldfish’s scales were made of metal, and there was
flesh below the scales. This little goldfish was made of metal too.
From top to bottom and in and out, there was no flesh. It looked
like a metallic fish statue. It looked weird.</p>
<p>Seeing the bubble land before the little goldfish, Han Sen did
not hesitate. He generated Jadeskin power and threw a punch at the
bubble’s wall.</p>
<p>That punch was not enough to break the bubble’s water power, but
the ice power froze the bubble. It was now solid.</p>
<p>Han Sen summoned his Cold Light Sword. He slashed at the
temporarily frozen bubble. The pink sword light shattered the ice
and water bubble.</p>
<p>Without any hesitation, the sword followed the person. The man
and the sword were one. Han Sen was thrusting toward the little
goldfish, which was eagerly awaiting its meal with its mouth wide
open.</p>
