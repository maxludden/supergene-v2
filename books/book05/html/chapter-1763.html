<p>What height must a mountain reach to be considered a tall
mountain?</p>
<p>There was no answer to this question, just like no one knew how
tall Unsolid Mountain was. No creature could reach the peak of
Unsolid Mountain. None had ever glanced at what lay at the
peak.</p>
<p>Even the highest tier xenogeneics of Unsolid could not reach the
highest point. All they knew was that the master that lived at
Unsolid Line was a real king.</p>
<p>But two beasts resided at the peak of Unsolid Mountain. The big
one looked like a rabbit, and the small one looked like a lion. And
next to these two golden beasts, there was a woman.</p>
<p>The woman was very beautiful and graciously elegant. The most
special thing about her was the horn upon her head. She was like
the purest of unicorns.</p>
<p>She brushed her hand across the fur of a gold beast, wearing a
difficult-to-discern smile.</p>
<p>“How is his blood? How much Roar blood?” the green-haired beast
asked, looking at the sleeping golden creature.</p>
<p>“Less than five points,” the woman said calmly.</p>
<p>“Less than five points? I thought it would be higher.” The
green-haired beast frowned, and he wasn’t happy with the
answer.</p>
<p>•’丫es, but it could reach ten points,” the woman said</p>
<p>“What do you mean?” The green-haired beast was shocked to hear
this.</p>
<p>The woman stroked the beast’s fur, and with a strange look,
said, “I don’t know where he comes from, and how he managed to gain
such pure blood of the Roar. But he is very talented and stronger
than the usual Roar. Perhaps he can grow further?”</p>
<p>“How is that possible? His body has blood that is stronger than
the pure Roar?” The green-haired beast did not believe her.</p>
<p>“He does not have blood that is stronger than the pure Roar, but
he has been infused with other blood. It provides him with more
opportunities, so maybe he will go further than the pure
themselves.” When the woman spoke, her eyes trembled.</p>
<p>“If things are really that way, that’s great.” The green-haired
beast was very happy, and he asked, “Why did you stop me from
killing the lesser life?”</p>
<p>“You can’t kill him.” The woman shook her head. She looked
weird. “They have a special connection. I don’t know why, but if
you were to kill him, it might affect this little guy’s future. We
cannot risk that.”</p>
<p>“But a lesser life can associate with a higher-race like the
Roar?” The green-haired beast demanded angrily, wanting to kill Han
Sen.</p>
<p>“God knows what he has been through. According to our theory,
his Roar blood should be gone. It should no longer exist. His
appearance now changes everything.” She paused for a brief while,
before resuming speech. “Anyway, keep your fingers off that lesser
one. He can die by anyone else’s hands, but not ours.”</p>
<p>Han Sen was currently making his way towards the xenogeneic
space. Xenogeneic spaces were never what they seemed; the space
within them was twisted.</p>
<p>It was like something that looked like a mountain from a
distance. But reaching it would reveal that you were in fact
traversing a big canyon.</p>
<p>Holy Heaven and Unsolid Mountain were like this, but the degree
of their distortion far exceeded that of a mere mountain. It was
the entire area. But Han Sen wasn’t going to a place like that
today. He was only going to a mountain, situated beyond a few rocky
hills that were a few hundred meters tall.</p>
<p>But when he drew closer, the hills drew together and xenogeneics
appeared. He did not know where they came from.</p>
<p>The Kate across would occasionally come here for a hunt,
gathering together into teams. The teams weren’t like Wizard,
though. They had very few members, but they were all Nobles.</p>
<p>And in regards to the xenogeneics, they did not often reveal
themselves for what they truly were, unless they had
protection.</p>
<p>Han Sen put Bao’er in the sanctuary because the geno universe
was too dangerous for her. Until he knew he could protect himself,
he knew he should not risk bringing Bao’er along.</p>
<p>Especially after what had happened with Golden Growler. Now, he
was going to be a lot more careful.</p>
<p>Han Sen donned his Dongxuan Armor. It covered him completely,
and his body was changed by the dongxuan powers. Not even Qiao
could recognize he was Han Sen.</p>
<p>After entering the xenogeneic space, Han Sen wanted to kill
xenogeneics. But he also didn’t want the Feathers to know he was
not just some commoner. To prevent the Feathers learning who he
was, he had to hide his identity with the armor.</p>
<p>Han Sen rode a dirt bike toward three rocky hills. But when Han
Sen reached them, they became mountains. It was like there was no
end to them.</p>
<p>So, Han Sen got off the bike and left it at the foot of a
mountain. If he was lucky, he could ride it back home.</p>
<p>Han Sen walked across one of the mountains, and soon he felt
that there was something hiding in the woods nearby. He entered
battle mode and stared at where the noise was coming from.</p>
<p>Quickly, Han Sen heard a rush of footsteps. And not long after,
something walked out. When he saw the shadow for who it was, it
gave him a big shock.</p>
<p>It was a fifteen-year-old girl who had no cat ears. She had no
tail, either. She was most certainly not of the Kate.</p>
<p>Han Sen looked at her for a while. She didn’t seem like a
different race; she actually looked human.</p>
<p>But her lifeforce told Han Sen that she couldn’t be a human.
Aside from Han Sen, there were no human Nobles in this universe.
And that was especially true of fifteen-year-olds.</p>
<p>The girl did not have any geno armor, and she looked strangely
like a xenogeneic. She had white leather armor and boots for
clothing, and there was a longsword by her side. She had a ponytail
and looked rather pretty.</p>
<p>Han Sen was looking at the lady when she drew her sword out. It
was purple like the moon, and with a girly voice, she said, “This
is a robbery. Give me your eggs!”</p>
<p>Han Sen looked at her and thought that he must have heard
something incorrectly. Either that, or he was hallucinating, due to
his recent lack of sleep.</p>
