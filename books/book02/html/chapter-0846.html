<p>Roar!</p>

<p>The minotaur was electrified. Its fur and bushy mane stood up on ends, starched. Not wasting a second, Han Sen followed up with a cruel smack to its head.</p>

<p>Pang!</p>

<p>The minotaur&#8217;s head gushed blood, and it roared more and more as it tried to fight back. But the silver fox was not done yet, and it spat more bolts of lightning towards the beast until it writhed around on the ground in a state of paralysis.</p>

<p>The specific silver lightning the silver fox was casting did not seem particularly damaging, but it was effective at paralyzing enemies. The minotaur couldn&#8217;t move at all. And Han Sen, again, took the opportunity to strike the monster&#8217;s head.</p>

<p>Kill! Kill! Kill!</p>

<p>With the silver fox by his side, Han Sen didn&#8217;t even have to try to defend himself. He swung the Flaming Rex Spike down on the minotaur like mad, as if it were a punching bag. It bled horrifically, and all it could do was shriek helplessly.</p>

<p>The body of the minotaur was tough, however. Although he had managed to draw blood, it wasn&#8217;t nearly enough damage to kill the creature. Even after a dozen hits, he knew he&#8217;d have to deal far more.</p>

<p>But then, multiple lifeforces began to emerge from the Devil-Blood Shelter.</p>

<p>&#8220;Little Uncle, go now! I will rendezvous with you at the Black Peak,&#8221; Han Sen barked to Wang Yuhang. He was afraid that if the effects of the Angel Gene Fluid wore off, the man would be so weak he&#8217;d be unable to even run.</p>

<p>Without hesitation, Wang Yuhang took off. As Wang Yuhang ran, Han Sen beat the minotaur repeatedly with his Flaming Rex Spike.</p>

<p>It was a brutal scene, as the squishy mound of the writhing minotaur streamed with blood.</p>

<p>Just as this was happening, Little Angel cleaved the strange wind-element bird in half. Then, she swooped down and hewed the Minotaur&#8217;s head off its body.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&#8220;Super Creature Windhawk Killed. No Beast Soul Gained. The Flesh Of This Creature Is Inedible, But You May Harvest Its Life Geno Essence. Consume Its Life Geno Essence To Gain Zero To Ten Super Geno Points Randomly.&#8221;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&#8220;Super Creature Flaming Minotaur Killed. No Beast Soul Gained. The Flesh Of This Creature Is Inedible, But You May Harvest Its Life Geno Essence. Consume Its Life Geno Essence To Gain Zero To Ten Super Geno Points Randomly.&#8221;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The two announcements overlapped. Han Sen knew they were first-generation super creatures, so he wasn&#8217;t too surprised at the results. Quickly, he gathered the two Life Geno Essences and ran away.</p>

<p>The scary presences that were coming from the Devil-Blood Shelter was not far behind. Knowing that he could not deal with the golem, he disappeared in his flight towards the mountains.</p>

<p>The spooky presences had now reached where the two super creatures fell. They cried out, unable to catch up with Han Sen.</p>

<p>Eventually, Han Sen reached the Black Peak and met up with Wang Yuhang.</p>

<p>&#8220;How fared the battle? Did you acquire beast souls?&#8221; Wang Yuhang ran up to ask, excitedly. He wanted a super beast soul for himself very badly.</p>

<p>&#8220;I only managed to get these two Life Geno Essences, so you can take them.&#8221; Wang Yuhang was filled with mixed emotions, receiving this response. He hadn&#8217;t received a beast soul like he wanted, but he got not one but two Life Geno Essences.</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t be sad, Little Uncle. When you recover, we can try that again. Beast souls are bound to pop-up sooner or later. How long will you need to rest?&#8221; Han Sen looked at Wang Yuhang as he spoke.</p>

<p>&#8220;It will take me at least six days.&#8221; Wang Yuhang looked across his own, weakened body and smiled wryly. He could hardly stand, following the side effects of using the Angel Gene Fluid.</p>

<p>He was in a slightly worse condition now, however, due to his stinginess. He had received multiple lesions and bruises, sustaining quite a bit of damage before using the liquid.</p>

<p>Han Sen was going to use his holy light to heal Wang Yuhang, but the silver fox suddenly spit out silver lightning towards the man.</p>

<p>&#8220;Aaargh!&#8221;</p>

<p>Wang Yuhang was electrified, and the power sent him flying through the air. Amidst the blood-curdling screams, Han Sen was shocked at the silver fox&#8217;s behavior.</p>

<p>The silver fox had never attacked a human before unless provoked, so why would it attack Wang Yuhang? Had the uncle&#8217;s bad luck made a new breakthrough?</p>

<p>But then, quickly, Han Sen noticed something. Even though Wang Yuhang was electrified, his wounds began to heal.</p>

<p>Ever since the silver fox ate the transparent little fish, its lightning had seemed to behave differently. It was different from before, and it was most certainly strange for the lightning attacks to simultaneously heal and inflict pain.</p>

<p>The silver fox spat out more silver lightning towards Wang Yuhang, and the wounds started to heal very fast. But seeing him electrified, thrown into visible pain, writhing, and screaming, was an unnerving scene that sent a chill down Han Sen&#8217;s spine. In the future, Han Sen thought he&#8217;d stick to his holy light and no longer trouble the silver fox.</p>

<p>Pat!</p>

<p>When the silver fox stopped shooting its electricity, Wang Yuhang lay on the ground like a crumpled mess. He jumped back up and started running towards the silver fox, in a bid to attack, screaming, &#8220;You animal! You are dead!&#8221;</p>

<p>Wang Yuhang had tears in his eyes, as if he had been humiliated. The pain brought by the silver lightning must have been unfathomable.</p>

<p>Seeing Wang Yuhang&#8217;s face, Han Sen decided it would be best to never allow the silver fox to heal him again.</p>

<p>Halfway through his run towards the silver fox, the little creature sent out another beam of silver lightning to shock Wang Yuhang. The body sizzled and smoked, as tufts of hair were singed and fell to the ground. His skin turned black.</p>

<p>This lightning strike was different. It was purely destructive, and it did not possess a single glimmer of a remedial desire.</p>

<p>Wang Yuhang, following his electrocution, was charred like charcoal. Smoke arose from his head, and yet, the silver fox did not relent. It spat out even more bolts of lightning. This time, Wang Yuhang&#8217;s body began to return to its original color as if he were healing.</p>

<p>Just as he was healed, Wang Yuhang became a recipient of more destructive lightning. And then, with his skin like scorched wood, he was healed by another remedial bolt.</p>

<p>Han Sen wasn&#8217;t sure what to think. He was almost scared, and as he watched what was going on, he vowed to himself never to mistreat the silver fox and incite its ire.</p>

<p>&#8220;Fox Master! I was wrong; please, forgive my slight!&#8221; Wang Yuhang chugged out those strained words in pain. Amidst his screams, brought on by the frequent electrocutions, those were the only words he managed to gasp out. Desperately, he tried to kowtow before the silver fox.</p>

<p>The silver fox lifted its head elegantly, and then leapt back onto Han Sen&#8217;s shoulders. It seemed to have forgiven Wang Yuhang&#8217;s sudden disrespect.</p>

<p>Wang Yuhang, however, swore he would do whatever it took to eliminate the silver fox. One day, he&#8217;d destroy the little creature. And as this desire took root in his heart, his exterior only presented a pretty smile to the silver fox, like that of a lady.</p>

<p>The silver fox&#8217;s healing power was most certainly different than other creatures Han Sen had encountered. And to his surprise, after Wang Yuhang was electrified, he was no longer in his weak, post-Angel Gene Fluid state. He was energized, the same as usual.</p>
