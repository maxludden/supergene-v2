<p>Han Sen’s body had just received the gold little gourd’s gold
light moisturization. It made the main and reverse Dongxuan Sutra’s
power increase, but it did not rip up his body.</p>
<p>The two powers slowly melded together, making things start to
become calm again. Suddenly, there was a flash. A weird person, who
looked like a lizard, appeared in front of Han Sen. His red eyes
were not looking at Han Sen. They were looking at Han Sen’s Inch
Grey Sword. His face was full of greed.</p>
<p>The Inch Grey Sword was the sword that belonged to the old
leader of God Chaos Party. It had a special and scary power. It was
in Soldier Knife Sky because no creature was ever able to remove
it. Han Sen had somehow managed to pull it out. Hate Ghost really
wanted the Inch Grey Sword for himself.</p>
<p>“Bury Path God said I should kill Han Sen, but he did not say
anything about the Inch Grey Sword. If I take this Inch Grey Sword
and hide it, even if he asks, I will just say I never saw it.” This
was the brilliant idea Hate Ghost came up with. He was going to
take and keep the Inch Grey Sword for himself.</p>
<p>Hate Ghost flashed and went in front of Han Sen to examine the
man.</p>
<p>Han Sen had been stuck in Dust Sky for a long time. He should
have been reduced to a commoner, but Hate Ghost still looked at Han
Sen carefully. He was not going to underestimate him. It did not
take long for Hate Ghost to confirm that Han Sen’s body was no
different than the average, powerless person. It made him feel a
bit more relaxed.</p>
<p>“It is pointless no matter how hard you try. The powers of Dust
Sky cannot be overcome by force. Even if God Spirits come here,
they would be reduced to the status of a commoner.” After saying
that, Hate Ghost reached his hand out toward Han Sen’s Inch Grey
Sword. He wanted to get the Inch Grey Sword first.</p>
<p>Before he could grab the Inch Grey Sword, a small hand grabbed
the Inch Grey Sword. Hate Ghost turned around and saw a little girl
next to Han Sen was holding the Inch Grey Sword. Her big eyes were
staring at him.</p>
<p>“Give me the sword,” Hate Ghost said to Bao’er with a cold
look.</p>
<p>“Why would I give it to you?” Bao’er asked with the curl of her
lips. “This is my father’s sword.”</p>
<p>“I told you to give it to me,” Hate Ghost said. “Stop talking
crap or I will break your head!” He raised his talons. He was not a
very patient person.</p>
<p>Bao’er clutched the sword and retreated. She blinked as she
said, “If you dare touch me, my father will blow your head
off.”</p>
<p>“Let me see if it is my head that blows up first or if it is
your head that breaks first.” Hate Ghost’s hands moved to catch
Bao’er’s head and the Inch Grey Sword.</p>
<p>Before he could take it, he saw a shadow flash in front of him.
A shadow wearing black armor had come before Bao’er to block the
attack. Han Sen had just been sitting there earlier. Hate Ghost was
shocked, so he fell back a little.</p>
<p>Han Sen was able to kill Weapon God, and Weapon God’s power was
as strong as Hate Ghost’s. How could Hate Ghost not be scared of
him?</p>
<p>After Hate Ghost thought it over, this was Dust Sky. Han Sen’s
power was already suppressed by Dust Sky. Even if he did have some
power, there would not be much of it left to be effective. He would
be unable to defeat him.</p>
<p>“If you would rather die first, I will be happy to fulfill your
wish.” Hate Ghost’s eyes turned red. Black smoke arose on his body
that looked like fire. He tried grabbing Han Sen.</p>
<p>“Bao’er, keep your gourd safe.” Han Sen returned the little gold
gourd to Bao’er. Without the nutrition of the little gold gourd
replenishing his body, Han Sen would have likely been unable to get
through this crisis. It had been his deliverance.</p>
<p>Now, the little gourd was looking smaller than usual. It had
used a lot of power.</p>
<p>After returning the little gold gourd to Bao’er, Hate Ghost was
in front of Han Sen. The scary black smoke was so strong that it
made Hate Ghost look like a demon from hell.</p>
<p>Without speaking, Han Sen gathered up the main and reverse
Dongxuan Sutra power. Those two powers combined in his hands. They
made Han Sen’s hands, which were wrapped up by the black Dongxuan
Armor, look even darker. It was like he was able to absorb light.
People were unable to see the hands clearly. They were something of
a blur to them.</p>
<p>Dongxuan Sutra’s power enabled Han Sen to see the original rules
of the universe. The reverse Dongxuan Sutra was another extreme
thing that enabled Han Sen to get to grips with rule simulation
powers.</p>
<p>Before this, Han Sen required his Super Spank skill to break
substance chains, but the reverse Dongxuan Sutra did not require
him to go to so much trouble. That was because he was able to
simulate rules to control the rules. It made the power of rules
adhere to him. There was no longer a point in spending power to
break substance chains.</p>
<p>When the powers of the main and the reverse Dongxuan Sutra were
put together, it led to the creation of further changes. The two
powers created Break World powers. It was not only the rules that
broke the universe that changed. If he had to use a word to
describe the Break World powers of the Dongxuan Sutra, it would
have been “modify.”</p>
<p>He was able to modify the basic rules of the universe. That
power was something not even a god could harness. In fact, gods
were the creatures that maintained the most rules, but God Spirits
were better at using the rules. They just did not have the power
needed to change the rules.</p>
<p>The Dongxuan Sutra’s Break World power enabled him to change the
universe’s rules. This power, in some way, was stronger than
destroying the universal rules.</p>
<p>Han Sen flicked his finger like he was flicking a wire on an
invisible harp. Of course, no music played.</p>
<p>Hate Ghost did not understand what the gesture meant. He did not
know what the point of him flicking his finger was. Now, given his
current situation, Han Sen could not block his attacks.</p>
<p>In the next second, Hate Ghost’s face changed. He felt as if his
body had become very weird. It was like his body was bound by some
kind of power. His claws were unable to be moved forward. It was
like there was an invisible wall prohibiting him from moving
forward.</p>
<p>Hate Ghost retreated. He felt as if he was fine, so he tried to
change his location. He jumped on Han Sen’s head and tried to grab
his brain.</p>
<p>Han Sen stood there without moving. His fingers flicked as if he
was still playing a harp. For other people seeing this, they would
have assumed it was meaningless. Only Han Sen understood that he
was using his finger to flick Dust Sky’s tai chi substance. He was
changing the rules. The tai chi substance combined to create a
universal cogwheel. The cogwheel combined and made a substance
chain.</p>
<p>Now, Han Sen was messing up the tai chi’s substance order. The
size of the universal cogwheel changed. Therefore, the substance
chain changed too.</p>
<p>Han Sen had modified Dust Sky’s rules.</p>
<p>This modification would not break Dust Sky’s rules or change the
order of things. It did make Dust Sky’s rules undergo big
changes.</p>
<p>“Argh!” Hate Ghost suddenly screamed.</p>
<p>He sounded as if his entire body had been sucked of its water
and hastily dried up. A few seconds later, he was nothing more than
a skeletal, dried-up corpse.</p>
<p>“No… Impossible… I have the Avoid Dust Orb. Dust Sky powers
should not work on me. Even if it did work, it would not do this to
me. Scary…” Hate Ghost did not finish speaking before he turned
into dust. His lifeforce and power were taken by the tai chi
substance, turning him to dust.</p>
