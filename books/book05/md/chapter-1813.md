Han Sen moved behind Yisha silently, and just as he was about to hit her over the head, his heart sank.

Yisha had been standing near the pool, looking into it But when Han Sen silently slipped up to the side of the pool, he saw his shadow and Yisha’s. She was looking at him with shock.

Han Sen gritted his teeth and still committed to his attack. Yisha was able to dodge, though. She frowned and said, “How did you get here? Even if you did kill Vic, how did you manage to cross the bridge?”

Han Sen did not stop swinging his scabbard at her. He was using it like a sword, trying to strike her. It would be best to kill her now, while she was a little worn out

“I walked here. It wasn’t all that difficult.” Han Sen attacked her, while also saying things to attack her mind.

Yisha wouldn’t be affected by such weak mental attacks, though. Her movements were still strong and calculated, and mistakes weren’t going to come easy. But she had just fought Hawk Wing, and that made her a little frustrated. She was at a disadvantage now, fighting Han Sen.

Yisha was so angry, and she wondered what bad luck she had mustered that was now forcing her to compete against Han Sen again. Every time she was about to get something, Han Sen was there to ruin things for her.

Her wounds still hadn’t healed from their first encounter, and she was deprived of quite a bit of her power. She wouldn’t be able to break through the limitations of Demon Grave, and so, seeing Han Sen strike harder and harder, she knew she was getting suppressed. She wasn’t being given a moment to do anything about it.

She did not know why, but Yisha felt as if Han Sen’s sword skills had improved. He was stronger than he had been in their last fight. It made the current fight much harder.

It wasn’t because Han Sen’s sword skills had improved, though. It was because Han Sen had learned some of the Teeth Knife techniques from the knifemind. And Han Sen was a beginner in Teeth powers now.

So, Han Sen now understood how Teeth Knife worked. He wouldn’t be any worse than Yisha right now.

Han Sen was suppressing Yisha quite easily. If Yisha had abandoned Teeth Knife and used other skills, even less powerful skills, Han Sen wouldn’t have managed to suppress her so fully.

Seeing that Yisha was going to get hit with the scabbard, a splash came from the pool of liquid. In that circular pool, the milky liquid blew up like an erupting volcano. The white juice lashed across the area in waves.

Han Sen and Yisha were both given a shock. They both retreated, wanting to dodge the white liquid.

The white liquid was sprayed across the floor, and then, they realized that the pool had dried up. There wasn’t a single drop of the liquid left in there.

The pipes that sent the white liquid to the pool were now dry. There was no more of the white liquid flowing through.

The pool was empty.

“Why is there nothing? Where are the origins of the xenogeneics researched by the crystallizers?” Yisha’s face changed. It looked as if she could not accept what she was seeing.

Han Sen felt strange. The ball had just rolled inside, too. So why was it gone?

Han Sen did not have the time to think this over, though. He swung the scabbard and tried to finish off Yisha. As Han Sen moved, he noticed Yisha’s face looked glum. The white liquid was approaching them as if it were alive.

It was a sight that was very familiar to the two of them. Things like that had turned Rocks Fall Duke and Vic into xenogeneics.

It had only taken one of the dangerous white columns to transform Rocks Fall Duke and Vic, but here, there were many. There had to be a thousand of the wriggling white things. They were like a horde of monsters, surrounding Han Sen and Yisha.

“Dollar, I will remember you. Do not let me see you outside of Demon Grave. I wouldn’t be the Knife Queen if I couldn’t kill you quickly in the normal world,” Yisha said, before trying to escape.

“Don’t leave yet! If you like me so much, why don’t you just stay?” Han Sen laughed and slashed forward to block her way.

Han Sen kept attacking her non-stop. Yisha had used up too much energy, so she couldn’t fight Han Sen. Plus, she didn’t want to fight. The white liquid was getting so close, and touching a single drop would be enough to end you.

Xenogeneics themselves weren’t scary. What was scary was becoming one yourself, especially if you became a mindless killing machine in the process.

“Why are you still coming after me? If we don’t leave, we will both become one of those mindless xenogeneics. Do you want to die with me that much?” Yisha pleaded as much as she was able to as she continued to dodge.

“Isn’t it quite romantic, to live and die together?” Han Sen’s sword skills came at her even faster.

He had decided to kill Yisha here. Since she was half-deified, she could kill Han Sen with the greatest of ease if she managed to get out He was just a Baron, after all. So, obviously, he did not want any of that to happen. He had to make sure Yisha did not escape Demon Grave.

Han Sen was not worried about the white liquid, either. The liquid itself did not seem interested in Han Sen. So, he was not worried.

Glancing over their shoulders, Han Sen and Yisha noticed the wriggling white things racing for them. There was a slight difference this time, though. Han Sen could tell they were going for Yisha, and so he stood near her to make it look like the white things were coming after him too.

Yisha did not yet know Han Sen had no reason to be afraid. And with Han Sen disrupting her, she felt angry and afraid herself. The white juice was coming.

“Dollar, I am going to kill you!” Yisha could not escape from Han Sen, so now she was furious. Her white bunny ears stood up tall and straight, and her long hair waved. Her entire body wrapped itself up in a purple flame.

She broke the rules again, as her power increased by several multiples. She tried to strike Han Sen with her hands, as purple swordflames blazed.

Han Sen kept moving, trying to dodge that flame. The purple flame wrapped Yisha up, though, and she managed to disappear and reappear in front of the sphere’s entrance.

That made Han Sen depressed. He hadn’t realized that he’d made Yisha angry enough to cast the skill. This time, it was too much for her, though. Her body was damaged. Even if she left Demon Grave, her body would be weak for a very long time to come.

Han Sen wanted to give chase, but he suddenly felt as if someone had patted his shoulder. Goosebumps flared across his skin.
