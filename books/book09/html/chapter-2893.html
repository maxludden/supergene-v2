<p>Han Sen knew what was wrong with it. He wanted to break Time
Ghost’s Absolute Time. To do that, he had to break the time power
area or unleash a speed that could blister through the delaying of
time.</p>
<p>After all, Time Ghost’s Absolute Time did not stop time. Time
still went by, but it was at a much slower pace. If the speed was
faster than the delay, Han Sen could hurt it.</p>
<p>Han Sen’s speed was not at that level yet. He could try it once
he reached true god class. For now, he had to find another way to
break through the Absolute Time.</p>
<p>“How is Golden Growler in the geno hall?” Han Sen directly
asked.</p>
<p>Since God already knew about the connection between him and
Golden Growler, there was no need to hide things. If God wanted to
deal with Little Gold Gold, Han Sen was prepared for it.</p>
<p>“Not bad,” God coldly said. “After all, he has the blood of the
growlers in him. Destroyed class spirits are unable to harm it, but
it is hard to tell if it has a higher-level god spirit. Let’s see
what it can do.”</p>
<p>This answer surprised Han Sen. He thought God would use Little
Gold Gold to lure him to the geno hall, but it seemed as if that
wasn’t the case.</p>
<p>After pausing, God smiled at Han Sen and said, “Did you watch
the fight involving the crystallizers lighting their lantern?”</p>
<p>“Yeah,” Han Sen replied. “What’s the problem?”</p>
<p>“Han Sen’s fitness level is not as good as yours, but his geno
arts are very weird,” God said. “It can reverse the bloodline of
something. It can force creatures into devolving. That power is
different from something like time and space. If it had an element
tied to it, it would be a life element.”</p>
<p>“Are you interested in him?” Han Sen asked.</p>
<p>“I am quite interested,” God honestly admitted.</p>
<p>“You should go look for him,” Han Sen said with a laugh.</p>
<p>God shrugged his shoulders and asked, “Did I not tell you God
Spirits can only travel with the body of a creature in the
universe? Besides, a universe’s god body restricts God Spirit
power. That is why I am using this body to travel around the
universe despite the danger. I cannot go anywhere. Plus, a place
like Space Garden… Without the master’s approval, not even I can go
in.”</p>
<p>After pausing, God said, “Plus, I have no time.”</p>
<p>“Can’t gods live forever?” Han Sen asked with shock.</p>
<p>“God has a duty. We gods have work.” God laughed. He looked at
Han Sen and said, “This time, I came back to tell you that
something has happened. I will not be coming back to the universe.
After six months, I will give you Wan’er back. Of course, that is
unless you want to go to the geno hall sooner.”</p>
<p>“Before becoming true god class, I will not go to the geno
hall,” Han Sen said.</p>
<p>“There is nothing absolute in this world. If you miss me,
perhaps you will enter the geno hall sooner. You will not just die
immediately.” God waved his hands and stepped away.</p>
<p>The sky suddenly presented a set of stone stairs. After God
stepped on them, he quickly disappeared with the stone stairs.</p>
<p>After God left, Han Sen felt relieved. He was worried God might
notice Han Sen and Dollar were the same person, but he believed God
hadn’t noticed anything.</p>
<p>That was expected. The ordinary Han Sen and Han Sen in
xenogeneic mode were two completely different species. Unless the
person knew there was a connection between the two, they would have
to inspect their genes to come to a conclusion. Otherwise, there
was no way to tell it was the same creature.</p>
<p>“What happened in the geno hall that made God return?” Han Sen
wanted to use Sky God Crown to enter the geno hall and have a peep,
but he resisted. He held back his curiosity.</p>
<p>If Little Gold Gold was not yet in danger, Han Sen planned to
become true god before going to see Little Gold Gold.</p>
<p>Han Sen looked at Time Ghost. Normally, he could not kill Time
Ghost. Now, Time Ghost was locked down there. There was likely a
way.</p>
<p>Han Sen opened his Dongxuan Sutra. He used one hand to go to the
Time Ghost.</p>
<p>Just like before, when Han Sen’s hand was about to touch the
Time Ghost, it felt like his hand was slowed. It felt like he would
never be able to touch Time Ghost.</p>
<p>Han Sen’s eyes flashed. His hand started to swirl. Since time
was going to stop, Han Sen ripped a crack in it.</p>
<p>Boom!</p>
<p>Super Spank. Han Sen’s hand broke the Absolute Time Area’s
substance chains. It broke layers in the Absolute Time.</p>
<p>Even though it was being restrained, the power of the Time Ghost
was still extremely strong. Super Spank was only able to break a
few layers of the Absolute Time. He could not break it
entirely.</p>
<p>“If it did not work this time, let’s give it another go.” Han
Sen put his hand forward and made a move. It made the area have
some swirls.</p>
<p>Han Sen attacked and attacked. He broke the Absolute Time. His
power proceeded to punch the Time Ghost. It made the Time Ghost’s
body shake. It was unable to break its armor.</p>
<p>“True god xenogeneics really are something else.” Han Sen was
holding the Sky Vine Radish God Lance. The moment he ripped
Absolute Time, he waved his lance at the Time Ghost.</p>
<p>If Time Ghost had not already been trapped, its spirit hadn’t
been taken, and the newborn spirit was not yet grown, Han Sen did
not think he could deal with it.</p>
<p>But Han Sen put in a lot of effort. In the end, he was able to
kill the Time Ghost.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Xenogeneic deified hunted. Time Ghost: Deified xenogeneic gene
found. Obtained Time Ghost deified beast soul.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Han Sen was happy. There was a time when he did not get deified
beast souls, but the Time Ghost power was special. Perhaps the
beast soul contained its special time element.</p>
<p>Han Sen could not wait to check it out in his Sea of Soul. He
saw the Time Ghost beast soul in front of him.</p>

<!-- “Deified beast soul Time Ghost: Area type (perfect)” --></div>
<p>Han Sen was excited. A Beast Area soul was very rare, but Han
Sen was also glad to see the perfect status. It was the same as the
Cold Light Sword. It meant the Time Ghost beast soul was very
strong. It could be used to battle a true god deified opponent.</p>
