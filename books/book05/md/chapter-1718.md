  “Hardman, your business is great You have spent such a small amount of money on someone who has the possibility of becoming a Noble.” Hei Xun sat down next to a monitor and started a discussion with Hardman.

Hardman laughed and said, “It is difficult to tell if he will be able to generate a geno weapon. Even with the flowers chinning, the possibility still stands on a fifty-fifty.”

Everyone could hear the false humility in Hardman’s voice. Fifty percent was actually quite high, especially considering how few people could make the flowers ring.

Lan Se observed Han Sen through the monitor and looked curious.

She knew he had made the flowers chime, but she hadn’t learned much more since then. She had looked for Han Sen in the graveyard, but Hardman had already come to him first and whisked him away.

Lan Se was curious to see if Han Sen could become a Noble. If he was truly able to, he’d have a near-infinite amount of wealth and fame.

Han Sen started casting his skills. Nobody said anything now, and everyone focused closely on him.

Han Sen used The Story of Genes and felt that his flesh, skin, bones, chest, and even genes were releasing some mystic substance.

The substance was like a sprout coming out of the soil. His skin was that soil, and the black substance began to grow across it It enveloped Han Sen, shredding all the clothes he had been wearing.

The black substance kept on expanding, forming into a set of armor all around him. The more of that black substance arose, the more the armor took shape.

Hardman looked at Han Sen and his geno armor, watching it as it changed. His palms were sweating in anticipation. He had spent quite a lot on Han Sen, and if this evolution failed, Hardman would be losing quite a bit on the gambit he had taken.

But if he succeeded, he’d be far richer. The mere prospect of having a Noble join Black Gold Group made him supremely excited. He could very well become a chairman.

Everyone looked at Han Sen’s armor in keen interest Lan Se was curious, whereas Hei Xun remained emotionless. It was almost as if all this did not matter to him one small bit

Ten minutes later, the shape around Han Sen was completed. The black armor he was wearing was very detailed, and there wasn’t a single seam around Han Sen’s entire body.

Just as everyone thought the process was finished, the armor began to twist. A black pattern emerged across its surface.

If you looked closer, however, you’d realize it wasn’t a pattern. They were symbols and words none of them could understand. They sank into the armor’s surface like engravings

When they were revealed, Han Sen’s armor looked very mysterious.

“No wonder he made the flowers chime. I have never before seen a set of armor look anything remotely like this,” Hardman said.

Generating a geno armor was always a weird spectacle, but he had thought Han Sen could also generate a geno weapon. Hei Xun still did not say a word. He kept on looking at Han Sen and his geno armor.

The patterns that had appeared on Han Sen’s armor looked mystic and beautiful. They made Han Sen’s armor a rather mesmerizing sight

Although there were no powerful energy readings, the geno armor had a strange energy of its own. Of course, the armor was brand new, so the energy wasn’t very strong.

Ten minutes later, the geno armor stopped developing. The process looked to have been completed.

To Han Sen, it didn’t really feel like armor. It actually felt like a part of his own body, generating this massive power flow.

Han Sen’s brain felt as if it was rattling, and then, all of a sudden, a voice started to ring in his head.

“Evolution Process Complete.”

Han Sen was shocked hearing this. It was the same voice he had heard all the time in the sanctuaries, and he thought it was something that only played within the sanctuaries. He was shocked it still existed, even out here.
