<p>“Race weapons are deified as soon as they are created,” Yisha
said, shaking her head. “They are smarter than the average deified
weapon. They are stronger, too. If the weapon was used by a
creature from the race that created it, the weapon would be
incredibly beneficial to them. There wouldn’t be any such
side-effects. If it was activated by someone of another race,
however, they would adopt the traits and powers of the race the
weapon belongs to. Their bodies would be invaded by the race’s
genes, which would turn them into something weird. Unless you gain
enough power to overwhelm the race weapon, you won’t be able to
hold off its effects.”</p>
<p>“Is there no other way?” Han Sen asked with depression.</p>
<p>“Well, I can’t say with certainty that there isn’t some way to
be rid of its influence. If there was an elite that could use force
to suppress the power of the race weapon and erase the Fox genes
within it, perhaps your genes could be placed in the weapon
instead. You could probably get rid of the gene weapon’s side
effects that way. It is like the Foxes’ Nine Spin Destiny Mirror. A
scary Fox elite erased the original genes inside the mirror and
replaced them with his own. That way, it became a race weapon of
the Fox.”</p>
<p>Yisha paused and said, “But the genes of the Foxes are very
good. I have heard that when they lit up their gene lantern, their
ranking was quite high. This purple copper jian’s power might
indeed be true god class. Unless you can find a true god class
elite that is willing to spend some energy wanting to help you,
there is no other way.”</p>
<p>“Does that mean I’m done for?” Han Sen looked as if he was going
to cry. He didn’t have a true god deified to help him. He didn’t
know of any to begin with.</p>
<p>Even if he did, there was no reason for someone else to expend
so much effort erasing the Fox genes inside the purple copper jian
on his behalf.</p>
<p>“You look quite good the way you are,” Yisha said. Then, she
continued flying.</p>
<p>It took a while for Han Sen to wake up from his disheartened
daze.</p>
<p>Han Sen equipped Glasses to hide his face, then used the item to
inspect Yisha’s genes.</p>
<p>The numbers on the display kept cycling. It took a while for her
details to be produced. The Rebate wasn’t a very rich race, but
Yisha’s gene potential was at eight stars.</p>
<p>“If the potential is eight stars, then that means she can become
a butterfly. If she wants to become a true god, a grand opportunity
will need to come her way and offer her a boost. It is a shame my
Blood-Pulse Sutra is only King class right now. I can’t boost the
genes of a deified. If I could, I’d definitely help Yisha perfect
her genes. That way, she would have a greater chance of becoming a
true god,” Han Sen thought to himself.</p>
<p>Before, Han Sen had tried to use the power of the Blood-Pulse
Sutra on the little red bird, but it didn’t work. His King class
Blood-Pulse Sutra was unable to push the self-cogwheel of a deified
being.</p>
<p>Han Sen looked at the white tiger. He noticed that its potential
was the same as the small Crocodile God. It was nine stars.</p>
<p>Han Sen asked Yisha to look at Ning Yue’s little green sword.
She was unable to determine what sort of weapon it was, but judging
from what had happened to him, it was likely a race weapon. Which
race exactly? She didn’t know.</p>
<p>The white whale had almost fully recovered. Han Sen invited
Yisha to ride inside the white whale, and it was an offer she
didn’t refuse. The group rode inside the white whale for the
remainder of their journey to Sky Palace.</p>
<p>They didn’t see elites from any other races as they traveled
through the systems of chaos. They often encountered space
xenogeneics, though. And luckily, Yisha was there to help them in
such engagements. With Han Sen and the little red bird’s deified
powers, they were in no danger.</p>
<p>That white tiger slept inside the ship day and night. It didn’t
lend them any power or look as if it was willing to lift a finger
to help out.</p>
<p>The white whale was flying forward as it usually did when
suddenly, a group of ships appeared. The sight made Han Sen and the
others feel a chill.</p>
<p>“Spring Rain,” Han Sen said when he recognized the symbols on
the battleships. It was Spring Rain, the group of agents that Miss
Mirror commanded.</p>
<p>Of course, when those battleships surrounded the white whale, a
man and a woman came out of the lead ship. The woman was Miss
Mirror. The man was the Fourth Uncle, Meng Lie.</p>
<p>“We just exited the Black Hole Spider not too long ago. Why are
they already here?” Han Sen was shocked.</p>
<p>“Han Sen, do you want to come with us peacefully? Or are we
going to have to drag you back?” Meng Lie asked with a laugh.</p>
<p>Han Sen remained silent. Although they had three deifieds in
their midst for combat, they were each of the lowest class. They
were primitive deifieds. Miss Mirror was a primitive deified, but
she had been deified for longer. Her powers were weird, and she
would be hard to deal with.</p>
<p>Meng Lie could certainly be a transmutation deified. Even Lando,
who became deified, had been unable to defeat him. Fighting him
would be harder than dealing with Miss Mirror.</p>
<p>But Han Sen had no choice now. He put on his peacock king soul
robe, equipped his Six Core Snake Bow, and exited alongside the
little red bird.</p>
<p>Yisha came out, as well. She quietly stood next to Han Sen.</p>
<p>Miss Mirror looked at Yisha and said, “Knife Queen, the Rebate
have always sided with the Extreme King. You aren’t going to
destroy our longstanding relationship merely for Han Sen, are
you?”</p>
<p>“The Rebate already has an alliance with Sky Palace,” Yisha said
flatly. “I’m willing to be friendly with the Extreme King, but if
you people keep trying to get in my way, then I have no other
choice.”</p>
<p>When Han Sen first went on the run, Yisha was slow to act
because she was dealing with the politics of the Rebate. She
couldn’t get the whole of the Rebate involved simply to save Han
Sen.</p>
<p>Now, though, the Rebate had entered an alliance with Sky Palace.
They had the protection of Sky Palace. It would be troublesome for
the Extreme King to dare touch them.</p>
<p>“Knife Queen, you need to rethink this. Is all of this worth it?
Is it worth betraying us on behalf of your student? You know how
traitors to the Extreme King are dealt with.” Meng Lie frowned.</p>
<p>“If I cannot protect my student, then what use is there for the
Rebate to even exist?” Yisha growled.</p>
<p>“I would like to see what benefits Sky Palace offered that have
given you the courage to flat-out deny the will of the Extreme
King.” Miss Mirror’s face was hard as she raised her hand and moved
to attack Yisha.</p>
<p>Yisha didn’t move, but she pulled out her short Teeth Knife to
attack Miss Mirror.</p>
<p>Meng Lie sighed. His body turned to gold, and then, he pressed
his hands down on the lion mount he rode upon. The gold color dyed
the lion.</p>
<p>The next second, Meng Lie waved his hand. The golden lion rose,
turning into a golden knife that resembled the head of a lion.</p>
<p>“I didn’t want to kill you, but you just won’t stay put.” Meng
Lie lifted the knife that looked like the head of a lion and
approached Han Sen. Each step he took was like he was crushing the
whole world. It felt like the whole galaxy had become smaller in
his presence.</p>
<p>Meng Lie was coming like a golden god. The little red bird
shrieked at him as a phoenix fire blazed across it. It became a
beautiful fire burning next to Han Sen, and it unleashed a scary
sea of flames.</p>
