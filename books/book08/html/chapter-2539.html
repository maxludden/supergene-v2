<h2>We Are Going to Die</h2>
<h3>Chapter 2539</h3>

<p>Han Sen wanted to hear the final part of God’s Wander, so he had
to continue hanging around Li Keer. But he didn’t speak to her much
while he was practicing. When they did talk, Li Keer would either
tell Han Sen about God’s Wander or answer questions about
herself.</p>
<p>“This person is a fighting freak like Lone Bamboo.” Li Keer had
grown a little depressed as they traveled. She planned to take Han
Sen as her silkworm, but after spending so much time with him, she
realized that there was nothing Han Sen really needed from her. She
couldn’t even bring herself to tell him that she was one of the
Very High.</p>
<p>Li Keer regretted this. If she had known this was going to
happen, she would have told him she was one of the Very High the
first time they met. That way, they could have had a more serious
discussion, at least. If she revealed her identity now, Li Keer
didn’t think it would amount to much. It wasn’t right, she thought.
She would even feel lower than Han Sen.</p>
<p>After Li Keer finished teaching God’s Wander to Han Sen, she
wouldn’t have another opportunity to reveal her identity and
convince him to go with her.</p>
<p>“I still have some matters to take care of. We will meet again
if fate bids our paths to cross once more,” Han Sen quickly said
goodbye to Li Keer and departed the core area. He returned to the
white whale.</p>
<p>Li Keer was so upset that she wanted to kick something. She
looked so sad when she returned to her ship.</p>
<p>“My Lady, what happened? Did you tell Dollar? Did he agree to be
your silkworm?” Little Butterfly asked, looking at Li Keer with
confusion.</p>
<p>Li Keer sighed and said nothing. She didn’t want to admit that
she had missed an opportunity to reveal that she was one of the
Very High.</p>
<p>“My Lady, what is going on? Why are the rumors saying Dollar is
one of the Very High? What happened?” Little Butterfly hastily
asked.</p>
<p>“It’s nothing. I will claim him.” Li Keer felt annoyed and just
waved her hand to indicate she wanted no more questions.</p>
<p>“Dollar, you must become my silkworm.” Li Keer nibbled her lips
in anger.</p>
<p>Han Sen returned to the white whale and was shocked to find out
what had happened in his absence.</p>
<p>Fang Qing Yu and the pirates were hiding in a corner, and Ning
Yue was curled up behind Bao’er. She was very scared, but Bao’er
was holding the purple ginseng that looked like a big carrot. She
chewed on it as she stood in front of the others.</p>
<p>Inside the control room, Gu Qingcheng was fighting Elysian Moon.
What surprised Han Sen was that they were both using area
powers.</p>
<p>“How did they level up so quickly?” Han Sen wondered. “They are
already King class.”</p>
<p>Although he had given Gu Qingcheng some xenogeneic genes, she
and Elysian Moon had become King class much more quickly than he
expected. And they were using area powers. That was a bit much.</p>
<p>That was especially true of Elysian Moon. She had spent less
time in the geno universe. There was no way she could have leveled
up this quickly.</p>
<p>The white whale’s control room had become their battleground. Gu
Qingcheng stood there with loads of swords coming out of her. All
those flying swords were like a river headed for Elysian Moon.</p>
<p>Elysian Moon opened her umbrella that was made of paper. The
flying swords, upon hitting the umbrella, were sucked into the
drawing on the umbrella’s surface. More and more flying swords
appeared on the drawing.</p>
<p>Elysian Moon spun her white paper umbrella, making the flying
swords inside the canvas come back to life. Now under Elysian
Moon’s control, the flying swords flew forward to strike back at Gu
Qingcheng.</p>
<p>Gu Qingcheng frowned. Her area power was put to work again. She
regained control of the swords and sent them back at Elysian
Moon.</p>
<p>The two pretty girls were having a stand-off, with one holding a
sword and the other holding an umbrella. A storm of swords flew
back and forth between them. It was like there was no end in
sight.</p>
<p>“What are they doing? Why are they fighting?” Han Sen asked,
after jumping over in front of Bao’er.</p>
<p>Everyone other than Bao’er shook their heads. Clearly, they
didn’t know why Gu Qingcheng and Elysian Moon were fighting,
either. They were also shocked about how fast Gu Qingcheng and
Elysian Moon had leveled up.</p>
<p>Bao’er was clutching her purple ginseng when she answered, “They
are fighting about which is bigger and which is smaller.”</p>
<p>“Bigger and smaller? What does that mean?” Han Sen asked in
confusion.</p>
<p>“I don’t know. I heard them fighting. Gu Qingcheng said she
wants to be big, but Elysian Moon said no. She said Gu Qingcheng
can be small, and she can be the big one,” Bao’er explained, not
seeming to understand it herself.</p>
<p>Upon hearing that, knowing expressions crossed the faces of the
pirates. “I know. They both must have fallen in love with the same
man. So, they both want to be with that man. But they are fighting
about which will be the mistress and which will be the wife.”</p>
<p>“Right, right; things must be like that. I’d like to know which
man is so lucky to have two pretty girls fighting over him.”</p>
<p>“A family must have been storing up luck for generations for a
man to have these two women. I can’t imagine what he did in a past
life to earn this. Maybe he saved the universe or something.”</p>
<p>“Saving the universe once wouldn’t be enough. He must have done
it twice, at least.”</p>
<p>“I don’t think so. That man must have been a virgin for ten
generations, and that was how he was gifted two women like
this.”</p>
<p>“If I was able to marry them both, I would be satisfied to live
with them as my wives for one day before dying.”</p>
<p>“You want to just die on top of their bellies?”</p>
<p>The pirates were now caught in a firestorm of discussion. They
all wanted to be the man that Gu Qingcheng and Elysian Moon
liked.</p>
<p>Gu Qingcheng and Elysian Moon looked very similar. They were
both beautiful to an almost disaster-inducing degree. The pirates
loved them. If Gu Qingcheng and Elysian Moon weren’t Han Sen’s
friends, the pirates and the Extreme King knights would have been
hitting on them night and day. They’d probably fight for them,
too.</p>
<p>When Gu Qingcheng and Elysian Moon heard what the pirates were
saying, they became even angrier. Gu Qingcheng turned to stare at
the men. The swords of the pirates suddenly flew out of their
scabbards. Under Gu Qingcheng’s control, they flew toward their
masters.</p>
<p>“Gu Qingcheng! Elysian Moon! Stop!” Han Sen reached out his hand
to absorb all the swords. All of the swords writhed like snakes,
trying to escape Han Sen’s grasp, but they were unable to.</p>
<p>Upon hearing Han Sen, Gu Qingcheng and Elysian Moon stopped.
They coldly stared at the pirates, who then felt a chill. They
quietly stepped back.</p>
<p>“You both come with me.” Han Sen took Elysian Moon and Gu
Qingcheng to his office.</p>
<p>“Tell me what’s going on. Why are you two fighting?” Han Sen sat
on the office chair and looked at Gu Qingcheng and Elysian
Moon.</p>
<p>“We are going to die.” Gu Qingcheng and Elysian Moon looked at
each other and said the same thing to Han Sen. He stared at them in
stunned silence.</p>
