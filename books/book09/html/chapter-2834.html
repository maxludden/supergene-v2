<h2>Lucky Gamble?</h2>
<h3>Chapter 2834</h3>

<p>God seemed to understand what Han Sen was thinking and coldly
said, “It is futile. Have you heard of representing general trends?
The general means nature like how fire does not have a shape. You
cannot see the wind. Water can flow. Every substance has its own
nature. Once you catch that nature, whatever chances come will
never leave it. It seems like there are a lot of changes, but in
the end, it will always return to its nature.”</p>
<p>Han Sen knew what God was saying. It meant Very High Leader was
originally an emotionless person. No matter what Han Sen did, he
could not change who he was. He also could not change the situation
they were in.</p>
<p>“How do you know if he is fire or wind or water?” Han Sen did
not agree with what God was saying. He turned his eyes, looked at
God, and noticed Very High Leader, who was next to God, was
petrified. His body had a rhythm. It was like his entire body was
connected to the sky, ground, and universe.</p>
<p>Actually, one could say they were combined. It seemed like Very
High Leader had become a part of the universe. He was a part of the
universe’s machine.</p>
<p>The feeling was increasing. It made Very High Leader’s presence
become colder and colder. It was like he was not a sensitive
creature of high intelligence. He was just a cold machine.</p>
<p>Surprisingly, God did not object to what Han Sen said and said
something that could mean two things. “I want to know if he is
fire, wind, or water too.”</p>
<p>Han Sen did not understand what God meant, but it seemed as if
Very High Leader understood him. His Very High Sense mind had
become stronger. It kept increasing over a short time. He was
almost as strong as a butterfly deified now.</p>
<p>Although it was just his mind increasing, his body was still
primitive class. It was still enough for his heart to change.</p>
<p>Han Sen thought, Even Very High Leader has reached Very High
Forget Love level. There is no need for him to keep the butterfly
lady around. Plus, he cannot defeat the butterfly lady.</p>
<p>Although Han Sen had a way that could enable him to get things
over with and end the entire bet, with God near, that method was
difficult to achieve.</p>
<p>“It does not matter how much you think. Why don’t you just
gamble with your luck? Sit back and see if he is fire, water, or
wind?” God smiled at Han Sen as he spoke.</p>
<p>“Could you at least tell me what the original ending was like?”
Han Sen asked God.</p>
<p>“If he chose the small love and the small relationship, how
could he end up becoming the leader of the Very High? You should
have known that,” God said.</p>
<p>Han Sen nodded. In fact, he had already guessed this. He still
thought Very High Leader would not kill the butterfly lady so soon.
But things were always unpredictable. This was now a gamble that
hinged on his luck.</p>
<p>No. You cannot gamble with luck. To use luck when gambling
against God, even if I gambled 10,000 times, I would not win once.
I need to find a strategy that can ensure my victory. Han Sen’s
brain spun fast. He could not think of a way in a short amount of
time.</p>
<p>With God near, using force would not work. But he was not God,
so he could not control the wills and the ways of someone’s heart.
That was much harder for him to win.</p>
<p>Han Sen wanted to question him, so he asked. “Can you tell me
how Han Jingzhi won?”</p>
<p>God went silent for a moment but surprisingly said, “He did not
do anything. He only made the right choice. Therefore, he won.”</p>
<p>“So, you are saying he won a gamble through luck?” Han Sen did
not believe that.</p>
<p>God nodded and said, “It really was that way.”</p>
<p>Han Sen did not believe that was how Han Jingzhi won. He thought
this might be God trying to lure him in and gamble via his
luck.</p>
<p>“What did you guys gamble on before? Were you also judging a
creature’s fate?” Han Sen asked. He was trying to gather more
information.</p>
<p>“Not just one,” God replied. “There were 11.”</p>
<p>Han Sen’s heart jumped. Eleven? That number is very close to the
number of people there were on the seventh team. Does that
mean…</p>
<p>Han Sen held the excitement in his heart. He smiled and said,
“You guys were able to gamble like that. If I knew we could gamble
like that, I would have selected a few more. It would have given me
more chances to win.”</p>
<p>God shook its head and said, “We gambled 11 rounds. If he lost
one round, he was to become my slave. But he did not lose a single
round.”</p>
<p>“Han Jingzhi won 11 rounds? What did you guys gamble about? How
could he win so easily?” Han Sen asked with shock.</p>
<p>He could not imagine Han Jingzhi winning 11 rounds against God.
Han Sen was having a hard enough time beating God once.</p>
<p>“We gambled that 11 humans would make a wish to me,” God said.
“He said 10 people would make a wish and one would not. He was
correct. Only one human he chose did not make a wish to me.” It did
not sound like God was ashamed of losing the bet.</p>
<p>Han Sen’s heart was jumping like it was insane. That is right.
They must have been the people from the seventh team. The one who
did not make a wish was Gu Qingcheng.</p>
<p>Han Sen still could not imagine how Han Jingzhi was able to
guess those wishes. Who would make a wish, and who would not make a
wish?</p>
<p>According to the theory, if Han Jingzhi guessed the people who
would make a wish, God would not try and tempt them. Regarding the
person Han Jingzhi thought would not make a wish, God would try and
tempt them.</p>
<p>In this situation, Han Jingzhi guessed them all correctly. That
was too weird.</p>
<p>Han Sen remembered the Ning family’s second father used to say
that Han Jingzhi told him not to make a wish, but second father
still made a wish. How did Han Jingzhi guess that?</p>
<p>While Han Sen was talking to God, Very High Leader’s eyes opened
wide. This time, Very High Leader was like a completely different
person.</p>
<p>Although his face and body did not look different and his power
had not increased, his presence felt totally different. It made him
look like a completely different person.</p>
<p>Every movement of the Very High made Han Sen feel weird. It was
like he had seen this somewhere before, but it was not the
same.</p>
<p>Suddenly, Han Sen was shocked. This presence… Why does it look
like the guy who calls himself God… hm… Aside from this God in
front of me… He looks like the guy called Qing Jun.</p>
<p>Han Sen was checking out Very High Leader. They looked so
similar, but it was just the presence that was similar. There was a
difference.</p>
<p>If Very High Sense is practiced to mastery, do people become
like those gods? Han Sen guessed. I think that must be right. Every
elite of a race that goes into the geno hall becomes like those
gods.</p>
<p>Han Sen was still thinking when Very High Leader looked at him
and said, “The gamble between us has finished here. I will take it
as a loss.”</p>
<p>When Han Sen heard that, he knew Very High Leader had already
escaped the mental struggle he had found himself in.</p>
<p>After saying that, Very High Leader walked over to the butterfly
lady.</p>
