  Night River King’s power wasn’t impressive when compared to other Kings. That skill he was using now was very powerful, though. As he fought, even the King class Galactic Lobsters were hurt by the attacks he hurled. Sections of their shells were shattered by the force, and the revealed flesh began to rot away immediately.

“Night River King sure has some skill,” Han Sen thought to himself. He kept moving around the battlefield, waiting for his best chance to strike.

Due to Night River King not having explosive powers, Han Sen had every chance to secure a final hit if he got the timing right. If Han Sen had been following around another king, one that had explosive powers, he wouldn’t have stood a chance. Explosive attacks of King level would tear the lobster apart too quickly for Han Sen to slip in a final blow.

“Xenogeneic Marquise Galactic Shrimp killed. Xenogeneic gene found. Obtained Galactic Shrimp beast soul.”

Han Sen was relieved to have finally gotten a beast soul. “After killing so many Galactic Shrimps, at least one was willing to yield me something.”

Han Sen didn’t have the time to inspect the beast soul at that moment, though. He had to focus his attention on the fight. He didn’t want to stumble into danger while he was distracted.

He didn’t want to make use of his Demon Bug Bai Sema unless it was necessary. His Ghost Teeth Knife was glowing a dark shade of purple. Its knife airs, when unleashed, killed large numbers of Galactic Shrimp. There were hordes of xenogeneics occupying that parcel of space, though, so he wouldn’t be able to kill them all.

While Han Sen watched things unfold, a Duke class Ice Blue Knight was fighting a Galactic Shrimp. That Galactic Shrimp looked a little stranger than the usual variety.

It definitely wasn’t a King class Galactic Lobster, but it was bigger than a normal Galatic Shrimp, and it had a translucent blue body. That soft blue glowed with the light of stars.

“A mutant xenogeneic?” Han Sen immediately focused on that fight.

The Ice Blue Knight was strong. Every individual knight there was powerful, but the one that was engaged with the mutant Galactic Shrimp was one of the best Dukes there was. As he began fighting the mutant Galactic Shrimp, he was able to get in a few early hits.

But then the tables turned, and he was having a hard time fighting the mutant Galactic Shrimp. It was plain to see that he wasn’t winning the engagement.

Han Sen took a closer look at what was going on, and he noticed that the Ice Blue Knight had abandoned the standard knight formation in order to block the passage of the mutant Galactic Shrimp. But he had done that specifically to draw the attention of the mutant Galactic Shrimp, so its arrival wouldn’t ruin his entire team’s formation.

The mutant Galactic Shrimp was strong, and its body carried a galactic light. It was incredibly fast, and each of its strikes was like a hammer blow. The Ice Blue Knight couldn’t evade its strikes. He tried to use his shield to block the mutant Galactic Shrimp’s attacks, but the shield was sundered by a single hit. The shrimp’s spikes did not relent there, either, for after the cloven shield was bypassed, it pierced through the Duke’s armor. Blood oozed out of the point of entry.

The Ice Blue Knight let out a roar. He ignored his wounds as his fists lit up with fires like a sun. They slammed down into the head of the mutant Galactic Shrimp.

Katcha!

The Galactic Shrimp’s eye was punched inwards. The shell of the creature was dented all over, which sent more of that glowing blue blood squirting out of the punctures.

But it wasn’t dead just yet. It gathered itself and summoned a green light, then flew at the Ice Blue Duke in a blur.

Blergh!

Ice Blue Duke coughed out blood. The armor on his chest was shattered. The shrimp’s spike had rammed straight through his chest, leaving him impaled.

Suddenly, a dark purple knife air appeared near the mutant Galactic Shrimp. The knife air moved with the ferocity of a dragon, drilling into the Galactic Shrimp’s already-wounded head. The creature squealed in pain.

Han Sen pushed the Ice Blue Knight off of the wretched spike and used his Ghost Teeth Knife to produce knife silks. He guided the silks to begin killing all the Marquise Galactic Shrimp that were closing in on them.

“I’m fine.” The Ice Blue Knight struggled to straighten himself back up. His chest and back were bleeding, and more blood began to drip from the corner of his mouth. But even so, he was already back up and wading into the fight.

His body was on fire, and his fists were like suns. He threw more punches at the mutant Galactic Shrimp.

“Crap! You’re badly injured, and you still want to fight it?” Han Sen didn’t dare slow down as he mused, though. He kept swinging his Ghost Teeth Knife, determined to get the last hit no matter what.

That Ice Blue Knight looked like a red bear. He was three-meters-tall, and he possessed a disturbing amount of strength. The power he summoned looked like a raging fire, and each punch was like an entire sun exploding. His attacks really did leave Han Sen speechless.

If he hadn’t punched open the mutant Galactic Shrimp’s shell already, Han Sen wouldn’t have been able to pierce through it like he had.

The fiery Ice Blue Knight was back to fighting the mutant Galactic Shrimp, though. Han Sen was fast, and he kept circling and attacking at the same time. He could slow their foe down and make the Ice Blue Knight’s fight a bit easier for him.

Pang! Pang!

Han Sen hovered in the air, casting his petrification shockwave. It petrified all the lesser Galactic Shrimp in the area, but it didn’t do very much to the mutant one. The attempted petrification only slowed it down a bit.

Han Sen was clutching his Ghost Teeth Knife, and he summoned his Spell rocket launcher. He fired a rocket that hit the mutant Galactic Shrimp, resulting in a mushroom cloud explosion. The Galactic Shrimp was marked with the symbol of a turtle, too. That definitely slowed the beast down.

But in that universe, Turtle didn’t do much to a creature that was flying.

Even so, Han Sen’s petrification and Turtle rocket attacks made the fight a lot easier for the Duke. The Ice Blue Knight was no longer struggling beneath the pressure as he had been earlier, and that was because the mutant Galactic Shrimp had become discernibly slower.

The fiery Ice Blue Knight roared and threw another punch, which hit the creature’s largest wound like an atom bomb. It blew half of the mutant Galactic Shrimp’s head clean off. The blue flesh below was scorched and smoldering with a red, ravaging flame.

“Please don’t die! Save your last breath for me,” Han Sen prayed. He was afraid that the Ice Blue Knight would finish the shrimp off. He flew forward, intentionally crossing the Ice Blue Knight’s path to block him. Then he fired a rocket at the mutant Galactic Shrimp.

It carried the Break Six Skies powers, delivering them directly to the exposed brain of the severely-wounded head. The rocket exploded and dealt heavy damage to the foe.

But the next second, the mutant Galactic Shrimp glowed green. Its body began to swell, expanding like a supernova. Its green light covered everything within a radius of one mile and destroyed everything within that distance.

Fortunately, Han Sen and the Ice Blue Knight were far away from that self-exploding mutant Galactic Shrimp. They had fled as quickly as they could, and thereby avoided the harm dealt by that explosion.
