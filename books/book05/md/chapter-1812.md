  Without hesitation, Han Sen walked right up to the crystal sphere.

The bridge led to the very top of the crystal sphere, and when Han Sen reached the end, he noticed there was an entrance at its top. The orb’s interior was hollow. It was like a football stadium.

He could see Hawk Wing and Yisha conducting battle in there. What shocked Han Sen the most was that Hawk Wing— who always seem so indecisive and reckless——was fighting Yisha and not showing signs of losing.

“Even I didn’t see that coming. He’s a powerful guy.” Han Sen was shocked that Hawk Wing’s powers were no less than Yisha’s.

His hands were like hooks, striking against Yisha’s hands that wielded Teeth power. The Teeth powers were unable to break his hands.

“I can’t believe the champion of Sky Bird entered Demon Grave and pretended to be little more than a noob. I am surprised you endured such self-humiliation for so long!” Yisha laughed coldly.

Hawk Wing hummed and said, “Hum! I am one of the Twelve Skies in Beast Area. What can you say about yourself? The Rebate Knife Queen that pretends to be nobody.”

“It’s not that great to be one of the Twelve Skies. You’ll be qualified if Twelve Skies come together.” Yisha sounded disdainful.

“If we were outside Demon Grave right now, I would not be as proficient as you. After all, you are half-deified. But this is Demon Grave, so what matter is it what you are? Take that deified title away, and you and I are practically the same.” Hawk Wing hummed coldly.

“Really?” Yisha stared directly into Hawk Wing’s eyes as her knife-wielding hands started to become furious.

Han Sen looked away from the pair for a bit, to get a better look at the surroundings.

That place was like a circular stadium. There was a crystal platform, and above it, there was a crystal hallway to get down to the center.

The pipes there ran with white liquid. And a lot of the pipes ran to the white juice at the center of the pool. He did not know where the pool connected to, and even though vast amounts of the white stuff were being pumped in, the level did not rise.

There was nothing else inside the sphere. Hawk Wing and Yisha were fighting each other near the pool, prohibiting each other from getting close to it.

Hawk Wing’s movements were strong. They weren’t too different from Han Sen’s phoenix movements. He had wings, of course. That was different from Han Sen, who had to use strength.

Overall, though, Hawk Wing’s focus was on speed. That was also different from Han Sen, who had the abilities of prediction and formation.

He was very fast, though. And with his hook-like claws, Yisha could do very little.

If this was a real fight, Hawk Wing could not beat Yisha. But Hawk Wing wasn’t looking to kill her outright. He just wanted to open a window of opportunity that would allow him to reach the pool without interference.

That worried Yisha a lot. Her movements were good, but her speed was a little worse than Hawk Wing’s. If she missed, Hawk Wing could fall into the pool.

Han Sen was peeping at the pair from the outside, not yet daring to enter. They were two opponents that would be difficult to deal with. He planned to wait outside, and maybe sneakily nab an easy kill if one became available.

As Han Sen watched them, something moved in his pocket. Then, that soft ball jumped out of it. It started to spin around on the ground, before rolling into the crystal sphere by its own volition.

The ball looked sticky, and it traced the walls down. It seemed to be following the pipes towards the pool.

Yisha and Hawk Wing were intently focused on each other, so they didn’t notice anything else enter. That aside, they wouldn’t dare think a pingpong ball-like object would come rolling in like that.

And with the pipes obscuring their view of it, the ball was able to roll all the way down and enter the pool.

Han Sen thought something might happen if the ball entered the pool, but everything was quiet after it entered. The pool was still the same.

Yisha and Hawk Wing were fighting harder than ever. Because they were slowly running out of stamina, their fighting abilities had become weaker after the duration of their combat.

Now you could tell who was truly better. Yisha’s power was weaker, but her skills had not wavered over time. She wasn’t making any mistakes.

Hawk Wing’s skills weren’t as good as Yisha’s, but he was weaker now than he had been earlier. Furthermore, his movements now were a bit twisted. His missteps were too small to be considered real mistakes, but they were there nonetheless. Yisha was taking advantage of that.

Slash!

With those advantages, Yisha took the opportunity to take a hack at his shoulder. Hawk Wing’s face changed, and he wished to fall back. But it was too late.

His shoulder had a two-centimeter cut, and it only hurt the skin.

But that was enough, and the wound continued to expand and bring blood with it.

“The Teeth power is too cruel. When you fight someone with that power, you really can’t afford to get hurt in the slightest. Otherwise, you are dead.” Han Sen complimented her in his head, but he was really happy he had managed to learn Teeth power.

“Knife Queen, d*mn you!” Hawk Wing flapped his wings and tried to fly towards the exit, with the speed and straightness of an arrow.

He was too fast, and Yisha could not stop him.

Demon Grave suppressed powers a lot When Hawk Wing was further away, the effectiveness of the wound would be weaker.

Hawk Wing flew out of the exit with a disheartened feeling. It would have been difficult to get the treasure regardless, but Knife Queen had pretended to be a woman called Yisha. It was all his bad luck.

As he thought of this, he felt a pain in his head. He felt as if he had been struck by a rod. He saw stars as he fell to the ground.

Han Sen grabbed his body and kept him from falling. He couldn’t make any noise.

Yisha’s attention was now focused on the pool. When she walked in front of it, she looked excited.

Han Sen did not hesitate, and he too now snuck into the sphere. He was headed for Yisha, and as he came up behind her, he had his scabbard ready to give her a whack.

Assaulting a half-deified elite on the outside would have been impossible. But here, her senses were weaker. This would not be a difficult attack to pull off.

The champion Hawk Wing had been knocked out by Han Sen, and that had been quite easy.
