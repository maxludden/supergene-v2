<p>“Why are you so nervous? Didn’t I tell you not to disturb me
unless I called for you?” Han Sen asked from the building.</p>
<p>“My Prince, this is bad! Queen Bai Wei is here,” Lilly quickly
said.</p>
<p>Han Sen seemed to have expected this, so he pushed the door open
and exited.</p>
<p>Bai Wei looked glum as she above the sea. In King’s Garden, she
received word that Han Sen had been destroyed by Bai Yi’s Return to
Origin. She went home and noticed that Bao’er and the blood kirin
were gone, so she immediately headed to Planet Water Zone.</p>
<p>Not long after, the water shifted beneath her. Han Sen brought
Lilly up to the surface with him.</p>
<p>When Bai Wei saw Han Sen’s face, her expression looked
conflicted. She said icily, “Brother Sixteen, you killed my guard!
And you also stole things from Planet Wind Zone. Give me Bao’er and
the blood kirin back, or I will let my father decide how to handle
these matters.”</p>
<p>Han Sen laughed and looked at Bai Wei. He said, “My good little
sister, I’m afraid you have made a mistake. I am Prince Sixteen;
why would I go to your planet and steal anything? I was only taking
what rightfully belongs to me.”</p>
<p>“Since when was Planet Wind Zone yours?” Bai Wei demanded
furiously.</p>
<p>Han Sen laughed. “I have taken Han Sen. His body and his mind
are now mine. So, I am him and he is me. His stuff is my stuff. So,
of course I took back what belongs to me. What’s wrong with doing
that?”</p>
<p>“You… Don’t give me these quibbling rebuttals! Give me Bao’er
and the blood kirin back, or I will go and complain to father!” Bai
Wei shouted.</p>
<p>“Whatever. I do not have time for you.” Han Sen turned to head
back into the underwater city.</p>
<p>“Stop! You can keep the blood kirin, but that kid is pointless
for you. Give her to me, and I’ll consider us settled.” Bai Wei
gritted her teeth.</p>
<p>“Haha! Such a beautiful little girl. Why would I give her to
someone else? Of course, I will want to raise her all by myself.”
Han Sen grinned.</p>
<p>“You *sshole!” Bai Wei roared. She threw a punch at Han Sen.</p>
<p>She knew what Bai Yi was like. Han Sen was taken and nothing
could be done about it, but she couldn’t let Bao’er fall into the
lap of someone as sick as Bai Yi. That was why she wanted her
back.</p>
<p>Han Sen’s expression was hard. He used his water area-of-effect
to bind Bai Wei’s body. It kept her from moving, and he easily
punched her away.</p>
<p>“Bai Wei, this isn’t a place for you to take a shit. Stop being
ridiculous! If you don’t, I will be rude to you,” Han Sen said
threateningly as she was flying away.</p>
<p>Bai Wei slowed to a stop and hung in the air, wiping away the
blood. “What do I have to do to get you to give me the girl?”</p>
<p>“You want the girl that badly? Did you make it with Han Sen? I
don’t see memories of such a thing in Han Sen’s head.” Han Sen
leered at Bai Wei.</p>
<p>“She is just a little girl! She is useless to you. What do I
have to do to get you to give her to me?” Bai Wei asked
stiffly.</p>
<p>“Such beautiful and cute girls are very important to me. Okay,
you are my little sister; if you want her that badly, then I will
give her to you. But first, hand me your Thousand Heart Lock and I
will give you back the cute little girl.” Han Sen grinned.</p>
<p>“You.” Bai Wei’s face changed.</p>
<p>Bai Wei didn’t have many good things, so she didn’t have many
decent geno treasures. But King Bai had given her mother the
Thousand Heart Lock. It was passed on to Bai Wei later. It was her
only deified item, and it was the only thing she had to keep her
alive. This wasn’t a secret among the Extreme King, and even Han
Sen knew about it.</p>
<p>Han Sen couldn’t give away Bao’er, and so he suggested something
he knew that she couldn’t trade.</p>
<p>“I will swap a King class item for the girl instead. She is just
a kid, you don’t need her!” Bai Wei looked sad.</p>
<p>“I said I want the Thousand Heart Lock. If you want my cute
daughter, bring me the Thousand Heart Lock. If you won’t, we are
done discussing these matters. I’ll leave you to think about it.”
After Han Sen spoke, he began to lower himself back into the
sea.</p>
<p>“Thousand Heart Lock is combined with my body. I cannot simply
give it to you. Even if I could, you wouldn’t be able to use it.
Aside from me, no one can use the Thousand Heart Lock.” Bai Wei
stopped Han Sen and gritted her teeth. “Give me the kid, and all of
Planet Wind Zone’s resources are yours for a year.”</p>
<p>Han Sen was shocked. Planet Wind Zone was poor, but one year’s
worth of resources was an incredible thing for her to offer. She
was planning to give everything for Bao’er. He didn’t know if she
had been able to tell how special Bao’er was, or if there was an
ulterior motive to her desperation.</p>
<p>If she was willing to do this to prevent Bao’er ending up with
Bai Yi, then it proved her to be a very good-hearted person.</p>
<p>“You are willing to trade so many resources for one little kid?
That kid is special. I should really take good care of her. Perhaps
she can earn me a lot more money. Maybe we can talk more about the
price later. Hahaha…” Han Sen dropped back into the sea.</p>
<p>“A**hole!” Bai Wei angrily punched the sea, but it a futile
gesture.</p>
<p>“That prick!” the princess of the Siren growled at the same
time. She was angry at what Bai Yi had done as well.</p>
<p>If she didn’t need the protection of the Extreme King and her
title as princess, she would never have married a scumbag like
that. Even just her title made her feel sick. She really wanted to
kill him.</p>
<p>“My Princess, we need to look at the greater good. Prince
Sixteen is the last generation of the virgin blood. We need him to
take the holy item,” the old Siren said.</p>
<p>“It is only because my blood isn’t pure enough that I cannot
activate the relic. If it was, I wouldn’t have to work with an
*sshole like this,” the princess said furiously.</p>
<p>The old Siren sighed. “We cannot change this. The Siren were
destroyed, and not many of us survived. We need to mate with other
races. You and Prince Sixteen have the blood of virgins. It isn’t
pure, though, so you cannot do it alone. It might work if you two
cooperate. For the sake of the Siren, please endure.”</p>
<p>The princess didn’t say anything in response. She looked towards
the garden, then walked in that direction.</p>
<p>Han Sen went to the garden, but before he reached his little
place, he saw the princess headed his way.</p>
<p>“What are you doing here? Are you so lonely that you require my
company?” Han Sen grinned. He was just pretending to be Bai Yi.</p>
<p>“Give me the little girl,” the princess said emotionlessly.</p>
