<p>Han Yan looked at the holy gourds hanging behind her. She hadn’t
expected to be the recipient of the thousand holy airs that were
bestowed upon Bao’er, but it came as a surprise that not a single
holy gourd had given her a holy air. It made her feel sick.</p>
<p>“I told my big brother that I wouldn’t disappoint him, but I
haven’t even received a single holy gourd air. I have embarrassed
my big brother. The people of Sky Palace will laugh at him.” Han
Yan looked at the gourds, trying to decide if she should do
something more to prompt the activation of at least one gourd’s
holy air.</p>
<p>Han Yan didn’t feel this way because she didn’t understand Han
Sen; it was because her living environment was different. Han Sen
had grown up with danger, and he had led a very rough and tumble
life. He never really cared about how people perceived him. He
valued his own safety and the benefits he earned for himself more
than other peoples’ opinions.</p>
<p>But Han Yan was different. Han Yan had never suffered before.
Even in the hardest times of the Han family, Han Yan had been doted
on by Luolan. Luolan expected boys to take care of themselves, but
she made sure to spoil her girls. So, Han Sen and Han Yan’s
personalities were bound to be different.</p>
<p>And when Han Sen became famous, Han Yan’s childhood became even
more advantageous. When she went to school, she went to a royal
school. Her performance there was exemplary, marking her as the
best in the school. She was the smartest out of all the girls in
her classes.</p>
<p>Of course, Han Yan had earned that distinction through her own
talent. Family support only played a small part.</p>
<p>Han Sen and Luolan had put a lot of effort into guiding Han Yan,
and while she appreciated their efforts, it had put a lot of
pressure on her. It made Han Yan feel that if she wasn’t good
enough, she would disappoint her big brother and mother after all
the time they spent on her. So, Han Yan always worked as hard as
possible to make herself the best could be. She wanted to be just
like her brother.</p>
<p>The more Han Sen achieved, the more pressure Han Yan felt. Her
workload increased, and so did her drive.</p>
<p>Now, she had taken her first steps into Sky Palace without
receiving a single holy gourd air. She felt at that moment that if
she gave up without trying, she would be betraying the effort and
expectations of Han Sen and Luolan.</p>
<p>Han Sen had never felt that way about his sister, though. Not
for a single moment. More than anything, he wanted Han Yan to be
happy. Her success didn’t matter at all to him.</p>
<p>Han Sen felt the same way about all the members of his family;
he only wanted them to be safe and happy. He hoped no disaster
would befall them and that they would be kind to the world in
return. That was his wish.</p>
<p>Han Yan seemed to think of something. She turned to face one of
the holy vine’s gourds and moved toward it.</p>
<p>The nobles of Sky Palace looked at Han Yan strangely. They
didn’t know what she was planning to do at first, but to their
horror, they soon understood.</p>
<p>They saw Han Yan walk toward a gourd that was twenty centimeters
tall. She grabbed it with both hands and tried to pull it down.</p>
<p>Blergh! Sky Palace Leader spat out the tea he was drinking.
Amidst wheezy coughs, he said, “What kind of family is this? Bao’er
drained the holy vine, and now this Han Yan is rude enough to try
and mug the gourds!” Sky Palace didn’t have a law that prohibited
people from touching the holy gourds, but anyone with a brain knew
that the holy gourd vine was a deified xenogeneic plant. You
couldn’t gain the holy air by force. Unless the holy gourd was
willing to give the holy air away, not even a deified elite could
remove it by force. And Han Yan was just a Duke.</p>
<p>Han Yan’s idea was simple. If there were no rules to keep her
from touching the holy gourd, she at least wanted to try it and see
if it worked. She wouldn’t know unless she tried. She didn’t want
to disappoint Han Sen, so she had to give it a shot even if her
chances of success were incredibly low.</p>
<p>The Sky Palace students stared at Han Yan as she focused an
intense gaze on the gourd in her hands. It looked as if she wanted
to yank the gourd right off the vine.</p>
<p>“She… really is a family member of Brother Han. She is
brave.”</p>
<p>“This is very creative. I like Sister Han, but she should give
up. She is just a Duke. If the gourd got mad, she wouldn’t be able
to endure its wrath.”</p>
<p>“This woman is crazy! She wants to take a holy gourd with
her.”</p>
<p>“She is as brave as her big brother, but neither of them has a
brain.”</p>
<p>“What a shame. She has a lovely body. With her beauty and her
relationship to Han Sen, she could have become a goddess in Sky
Palace. Now, everyone knows that her brain is bad. She can’t be a
goddess. She will be recognized as a crazy woman for sure.”</p>
<p>Even Exquisite stared at Han Yan with a strained look on her
face. She had never seen anything like this before, either.</p>
<p>The Sixth Elder was happy about this. He laughed out loud and
was unable to control himself. He looked at Yun Changkong and said,
“Elder Yun, my brother, congratulations. You have an excellent
student. I have heard she is your exclusive student. It is good
that you have this student. She won’t let go of anything.” Yun
Changkong’s wry smile had frozen on his face as he watched Han Yan
move to clutch the holy gourd.</p>
<p>“The Han family… who are these people?” Yun Changkong’s mind had
gone blank except for this small question.</p>
<p>The Dream Beast was near a lake. He saw all this, and his eyes
smiled like a moon.Yun Suyi and Yun Sushang, and all the others
that were close with Han Sen, stood as still as statues. Sky Palace
had a long history, and across those annals of time, very few had
ever dared to try what Han Yan was doing.</p>
<p>Han Yan didn’t care about what others thought. She held onto
that holy gourd and tried yanking it down.</p>
<p>But the holy gourd was a deified xenogeneic plant. It was a
treasure of Sky Palace. Not even ordinary deifieds could harm it.
Han Yan’s strength was ant-like by comparison. It didn’t matter how
hard she tried, the gourd would not budge. Han Yan noticed she
wasn’t able to pull it down, but she refused to give up so easily.
She used her super god body, wanting to try her best. Even if it
didn’t work, at least she could say she tried. No regrets.</p>
<p>Thousand Feather Crane cleared his throat. “Brother Han, it is
almost time. Lead your sister to Sky Palace.”</p>
<p>He hoped Han Sen could convince Han Yan to stop yanking on the
holy vine. He just didn’t know how to tell her himself.</p>
<p>Han Sen hadn’t expected Han Yan to try something like this. He
was as surprised as all the rest, but he still pretended to be
calm. He said, “It is fine. It’s good when young people come up
with ideas like this. Let her carry on.”</p>
<p>Han Sen wouldn’t undercut anything that Han Yan had decided to
do. If the rules of Sky Palace didn’t forbid her from trying to
touch the holy gourd, then he certainly wouldn’t stop her.</p>
<p>As this happened, Han Yan’s body changed. Her long black hair
became a black crystal waterfall. It reached all the way down to
her feet. Her eyes were like black gemstones. Her whole body
swirled with a mysterious, holy air.</p>
