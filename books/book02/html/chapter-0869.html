    <p>&#8220;Is there no other way?&#8221; Han Sen asked, frowning.</p>

    <p>
      The people had been trapped there for a very long time, some for decades.
      If they really had no clue, Han Sen suspected he might not be able to find
      a solution anytime soon, either.
    </p>

    <p>
      Wang Jiangang said, &#8220;It&#8217;s not that there is no way; in fact,
      we believe there might be. We are just unsure whether or not we can pull
      it off. 'Tis a crying shame.&#8221;
    </p>

    <p>&#8220;What do you mean?&#8221; Han Sen asked.</p>

    <p>
      Wang Jiangang pointed at the Tree King and said, &#8220;At night, those
      Dark Haunted Bugs deliver nectar to the Tree King. They feed monsters that
      reside within it. The monsters inside seem to have a manner of control
      over the bugs and trees. We believe if we can kill whatever lurks inside
      that wooden fiend, we&#8217;ll be free to leave. But those monsters are so
      very strong, and with the risk of being killed through a quick aging
      process by venturing close, we don&#8217;t believe such a thing is
      possible. None of us here possess the necessary experience needed to pull
      such a thing off, and it&#8217;s a crying shame.&#8221;
    </p>

    <p>&#8220;What is the monster, exactly?&#8221; Han Sen asked, curiously.</p>

    <p>
      &#8220;The Dark Haunted Tree King is different than the other trees. Those
      fruits to do not birth bugs; they release bat-like creatures. Sometimes
      they will consume the nectar the bugs deliver, with a speed unlike
      anything you&#8217;ve ever seen. You&#8217;d be hard-pressed catching
      those things on the move,&#8221; Liu Fang chimed in.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen spoke with them for a while and then decided to stay a while and
      wait to see if he could catch a glimpse of what he might be dealing with
      past nightfall.
    </p>

    <p>
      That night, Han Sen planned on leaving Zero behind and going alone. But
      Zero wasn&#8217;t having it, and she insisted on following him.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen had no choice but to accept her company, and since he was watching
      from afar anyway, he didn&#8217;t think her presence would cause too much
      trouble.
    </p>

    <p>
      The luminous flowers bloomed and the Dark Haunted Bugs filled the space
      beneath the canopy. Even at night, the forest was illuminated due to the
      light they cast. Without hesitation, Han Sen and Zero ventured towards the
      area where the Tree King resided.
    </p>

    <p>
      The people in the camp had seen far too many desperate people trap
      themselves in bids to escape, so they didn&#8217;t bother trying to stop
      them. Liu Fang did remind them, however, that the radius of the Tree
      King&#8217;s effect was one kilometer.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen nodded and proceeded to where the Dark Haunted Tree King was. By
      following the bugs, it didn&#8217;t take them long to arrive.
    </p>

    <p>
      The Dark Haunted Tree King was like a hill, dressed in luminous flowers.
      The center of each open fruit had a black bat hanging from it.
    </p>

    <p>
      Endless streams of bugs came, to and fro, delivering all their nectar into
      the open, luminous flowers. When they filled up, the nectar would flow and
      drip into the mouths of the black bats and feed them.
    </p>

    <p>
      After hearing what Liu Fang had to say, he also paid heed to his own
      lifeforce. Despite what he had been told, he didn&#8217;t notice anything
      damaging occurring to it.
    </p>

    <p>
      Liu Fang mentioned even the ordinary trees could make a person age and
      absorb one&#8217;s lifeforce. And regardless of how little it was, it was
      something Han Sen should have been able to sense.
    </p>

    <p>But still, Han Sen felt nothing. And this made him frown.</p>

    <p>
      He looked at the distance between him and the tree, and noticed he was
      standing exactly one kilometer away from the Tree King. Han Sen made Zero
      wait there, while he approached.
    </p>

    <p>
      But again, Zero wasn&#8217;t willing to be left behind. When Han Sen took
      a step forward, so did she. Han Sen had no choice but to accept her
      insistence of accompanying him, and allow her to come. She was a much
      happier girl these days, but she was still as stubborn as ever.
    </p>

    <p>
      With Zero around, though, he didn&#8217;t dare get too close. As he
      approached carefully, he calculated his distance away from the tree.
    </p>

    <p>
      Suddenly, Han Sen felt his body&#8217;s energy start to drain. He quickly
      pulled her back with him about ten meters, and the leak of lifeforce he
      had felt stopped.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;That makes no sense!&#8221; Han Sen was shocked, unable to believe
      his lifeforce could leak out uncontrollably as it had.
    </p>

    <p>
      While Han Sen was lost in thought, Zero did not stop. She continued to
      approach the Tree King, unheeding Han Sen&#8217;s concern. He shouted out
      to her, &#8220;Zero, what are you doing? Get back here!&#8221;
    </p>

    <p>
      Zero did not listen and did not turn around, she continued her stroll
      right into the danger zone. Han Sen moved forward to grab her back.
    </p>

    <p>
      But then, Zero&#8217;s black hair turned purple and two purple horns
      erupted from her forehead—she was becoming a shura.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen looked at Zero, unsure why Zero was so determined to walk towards
      the Tree King and why she was turning into a shura.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Zero, what are you doing? Come back!&#8221; Han Sen shouted again.
    </p>

    <p>
      Zero ignored Han Sen&#8217;s request once more, and she continued walking
      forward mindlessly. Her purple hair dragged along the ground, and her
      purple horns were glowing brightly.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen summoned his devil-eye mask to take a look at Zero, and he noticed
      that her lifeforce was blazing like a firestorm. For some reason, it
      wasn&#8217;t leaking at all.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;What is this?&#8221; Han Sen was shocked. Zero wasn&#8217;t losing
      any of her lifeforce, and this was something not even he could do.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen decided not to pull her back and he stopped calling out, since she
      didn&#8217;t appear to be in danger. Right now, he was transfixed, curious
      to see what Zero was going to do.
    </p>

    <p>
      Her powers surprised Han Sen. It had been a while since he saw Zero become
      a shura, and her lifeforce was like that of a super creature. It was far
      stronger than what she was like when she was just a human.
    </p>

    <p>
      The bats on the flower screamed, indicating they had detected her
      presence. They flew out of their flowers, down towards Zero.
    </p>

    <p>
      There were many bats, at least three hundred. Judging from their
      lifeforces, they were each almost at the power of a super creature, too.
    </p>

    <p>
      Their power was comparable to that of a human who had used the shura
      liquid.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen&#8217;s worry returned, seeing Zero continue to walk forward with
      so many powerful bats swooping down towards her. But in the next second,
      that worry became shock.
    </p>

    <p>
      When the bats had almost reached Zero, fangs bared, she reached her hand
      to grab the bat leading the charge. She tore it in half, dressing the
      ground with its black blood.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen had never seen Zero fight so brutally, even when she was a shura.
      And one by one, she continued doing what she did to the first bat. She
      tore each in half with lightning speed, and not a single bat was able to
      deliver the smallest speck of damage.
    </p>

    <p>
      The way she fought was like an animal, and anyone who saw it would most
      certainly be afraid.
