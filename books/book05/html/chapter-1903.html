<p>When Han Sen returned to his seat, everyone looked at him
differently. Now, people were looking at him as if he was a
monster.</p>
<p>Han Sen was not in a good mood. He had only wanted to show off
Ancient Devil’s mind a little bit, but that display had obviously
gone off the rails. He wondered what the Kings of Narrow Moon might
be thinking of him now; Yisha in particular.</p>
<p>“Ancient Devil, why did you do that?” Han Sen asked coldly,
placing his will back inside Destiny’s Tower.</p>
<p>“I was just giving you what you wanted,” Ancient Devil
responded.</p>
<p>He sat where he was, unmoving. He smiled like a Buddha touching
flowers.</p>
<p>Han Sen didn’t say anything in response. He merely looked at
Ancient Devil for a bit, then left the tower.</p>
<p>“Ancient Devil is way too dangerous. I can’t risk letting him
out,” Han Sen thought to himself.</p>
<p>What happened next, in the gathering, was suddenly much more
boring. After No Flower and Han Sen’s performances, even though
there were many talented Buddhas and Rebates, the event was a
slog.</p>
<p>People weren’t thinking much about the event anymore. People’s
minds were too preoccupied with Han Sen.</p>
<p>“An amazing mind, Qing Li. You were right. Han Sen’s mind is
strong. I wonder how he managed to practice that.” Du Lishe looked
strange.</p>
<p>Qing Li did not know what to say. This was not the mind she had
previously seen. What she had seen was Teeth Knife knifemind. But
now, they were not going to believe that, so all she did was
smile.</p>
<p>“It is a shame he has hair. Otherwise, I would believe him to be
one of the Buddhas. He could most certainly be a King class Buddha,
or even a deified one.” Rebecca kept looking over to where Han Sen
was sitting.</p>
<p>That Buddha sentence shocked the people of Moon Garden. It was
hard to imagine that it had all come out of a Baron.</p>
<p>The event kept on chugging along, and when Speechless took the
stage, she looked over to where Han Sen was sitting. She bowed and
said, “I hope I can compete so skillfully against Han Sen. Please
teach me something.”</p>
<p>Being challenged by Speechless like that, made everyone look at
Han Sen again. They were all hoping that he’d accept. People in
Narrow Moon knew Han Sen could use Teeth powers.</p>
<p>Han Sen shook his head. “You are too polite. I have not
practiced sword skills much. I am afraid I’d perform too poorly for
you to see.”</p>
<p>Han Sen was too obvious earlier, and he wasn’t keen on the
prospect of performing again in front of everyone.</p>
<p>“That is okay. Skills are all connected. Knife Queen’s Teeth
Knife is so famous, and if you can use knife skills, I would be
glad,” Speechless said.</p>
<p>Now that Speechless had said that, it would reflect poorly if
Han Sen continued to decline. So Han Sen thought for a moment and
then said, “I am not very good at sword skills, and I don’t like
hitting women. How about this person next to me? Her sword skills
are great. If you really want someone worth competing against, ask
her to practice with you.”</p>
<p>Hearing that, Speechless frowned and looked upset.</p>
<p>“Han Sen, Speechless is a guest here. You cannot be so rude as
to deny this,” Moon Wheel King said.</p>
<p>“Okay,” Han Sen answered, standing up.</p>
<p>Speechless suddenly smiled and said, “In that case, I will fight
against her. And if she loses, you will compete with me. Is that
correct?”</p>
<p>“If you really are that desperate for this, then okay.” Han Sen
nodded. They were both Viscount class opponents, so Han Sen did not
believe Gu Qingcheng could lose.</p>
<p>“I am sorry to bother you, my lady.” Speechless bowed to Gu
Qingcheng.</p>
<p>Gu Qingcheng rolled her eyes at Han Sen, got up, and walked to
the stage.</p>
<p>Narrow Moon and the Buddhas were curious. They did not know why
Han Sen would let his subordinate practice against Speechless.</p>
<p>Many people thought Han Sen was just a Baron. He had a powerful
will, but not powerful strength. Perhaps he did not want to
embarrass himself, so he pushed a subordinate out to take the fall
for him.</p>
<p>But that did not make sense, either. If she lost, he would have
to go fight Speechless, anyway.</p>
<p>As people guessed what Han Sen was trying to accomplish, the
practice started.</p>
<p>Speechless let a worker bring out the same Viscount sword. Then
she said to Gu Qingcheng, “If you think this sword is poor, you may
feel free to use your own.”</p>
<p>“It’s the same.” Gu Qingching picked up the offered sword.</p>
<p>Speechless smiled and picked up the other. She said,
“Please.”</p>
<p>Gu Qingcheng pulled the sword back and swung it at
Speechless.</p>
<p>It was an ordinary technique to draw back the sword. But in her
hands, it wasn’t so simple.</p>
<p>Gu Qingcheng’s sword skills were overbearing. The moment she
held the sword, they were at one with each other.</p>
<p>In Speechless’ eyes, it suddenly felt as if her entire world had
been taken by that sword. She could not dodge the quick strike, and
all she could do was use her hand to fight against it.</p>
<p>“What a powerful swordmind!” Speechless was shocked. She did not
expect a subordinate of Han Sen could be such an effective
swordsman.</p>
<p>She never anticipated that the sword would come at her with such
speed. Speechless gathered up her sword power and composed her
swordmind to fight back.</p>
<p>But Speechless was not very good at fighting in this manner. She
wasn’t called Speechless because she was mute, but because the
Buddha that opened her eyes was called Speechless. She was grateful
for that, and so she called herself Speechless.</p>
<p>Speechless Buddha King was good at Speechless Sword. But
Speechless Sword was silent. It was a sonic-power skill that no one
could hear. It was scary.</p>
<p>The swords made no sound, and no one spoke.</p>
<p>Many of Speechless Buddha’s past enemies never knew what
happened to them, or why they were killed. Their deaths had come
faster than they could utter a word.</p>
<p>Speechless Sword was scary, but you could not fight it
head-to-head.</p>
<p>The two swords clashed against each other. But then, Gu
Qingcheng returned her sword and walked off the stage. Katcha!</p>
<p>Everyone saw Gu Qingcheng leave the stage, and as they did, the
Nobles wondered what had just occurred. And then, they heard a
sound. Speechless1 sword had been broken in half. Her eyebrow was
now home to a small cut. Blood dripped out from the laceration, and
it looked like another red mole.</p>
<p>Everyone was shocked. Speechless had been quickly defeated by
Han Sen’s subordinate. The whole event had been silent, as if the
spectators had watched a battle of ghosts.</p>
<p>“Sword skills like that.. Where do my sword skills stack up
against that?11 Everyone recalled what Han Sen had said, and their
stomachs felt hollow.</p>
