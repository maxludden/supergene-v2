  Only someone with charisma could be a general. A soldier that could not make his comrades trust him could only be a good soldier at best, instead of a general.

Obviously, Han Sen was equipped with this charisma. It was just he had not got a chance to use it properly.

Sweating heavily and burning his muscles, Han Sen felt he was a beast on fire, squandering his wild nature and rushing toward the end.

Many soldiers clenched their fists at some point and stared at Han Sen, as if they were in the device with him. When Han Sen finally reached the end, everyone felt relieved and incredibly good.

Applause sounded like thunder.

"Chief, cookhouse soldier Han Sen has finished the test, waiting for your instruction." Han Sen saluted to the officer judging the test. As he moved his arm, sweat fell, reflecting sunlight and the vital energy of youth.

"At ease. Well done, you could go back to your seat," the officer said with a smile.

Seeing Han Sen going back, the chief said, "Very good… Very good indeed… This is more like a soldier from Southwest Galaxy."

The secretary who understood the chief very well had very different understanding of this short comment.

According to what the secretary knew about the chief, if he said good, then it was a great complement already. If he said very good, it meant the chief appreciated the person a lot. Now that the chief said very good twice, with a strong tone, he must feel so excited inwardly. The secretary rarely heard the chief say something twice, and yet he did.

"Brother, well done. You really made it." When Han Sen returned to his seat, the young soldier patted Han Sen excitedly.

"Piece of cake." Han Sen licked his lips and sat down on his seat.

Currently, Han Sen was sore all over. Although it did not take long, he consumed a great deal of his energy. Also, he was exhausted from using Overload. Luckily, he had Jadeskin, otherwise his body might collapse.

Han Sen was so fatigued that he wished he could simply lie on the floor and sleep. However, there were other items that he needed to finish, so he could not gain enough rest.

Luckily, all the remaining items did not have much to do with body strength. Shooting, warframe operation, dissembling and reassembling the combat machines were the main parts of the military contest.

In interstellar wars, science and technology were still the priority. Unless someone could reach the level of surpasser, a soldier could not beat a warframe, let alone large weapons.

What Han Sen had learned from school was put into use here. He ended up with a high score on each item, definitely a well-rounded soldier.

Although Tie Yi was great, Han Sen was not worse than him. In many items, they were each either the first or the second. The two were on quite the same level.

All the soldiers felt it was great to watch. As a cookhouse soldier from Southwest Galaxy, Han Sen was able to perform as a close match to the Tiger of Blueblood Special Force, which earned a great honor for the Southwest Galaxy and left a great impression on the soldiers.

Although Zheng Yuze did well in the following items as well, he could not be compared with Han Sen or Tie Yi. When the total score was calculated, Han Sen was the first place, beating Tie Yi by 0.2, making all the soldiers of Southwest Galaxy cheer.

Tie Yi did not ignore Han Sen like before, but he still did not think Han Sen was a worthy opponent.

Although Han Sen did well, his advantage was mainly in the technical items. It did not mean that Han Sen had better fighting skills than Tie Yi.

However, the final combat was a one on one combat, which would call for real strength, of which Tie Yi was very confident.

Han Sen did not say anything but tried to recover as much as possible, waiting for the combat for the title of soldier King.

Only the top four contestants with the highest scores could participate in the combat. In addition to Han Sen and Tie Yi, Zheng Yuze and some soldier from an army came to the combat. Wang Gang did not make it to the top floor.

The four of them were split into two groups. The winners of the groups would enter the finals to compete for the championship, while the losers would compete for the third place.

The grouping was decided by a draw. Luckily, Han Sen and Tie Yi were in the same group, which meant the finals came earlier.

It was a great news to Han Sen. He had not fully recovered yet. If he consumed some of his energy in another fight before he met Tie Yi, it would be even harder.

If I could finish the third phase longevity in Heresy Mantra, I should be able to resolve the issue of the lack of energy. However, the third phase is so hard that I am still unable to complete it after so long. Han Sen thought to himself helplessly.

However, it was useless to think too much. He had to think of a way to beat Tie Yi.

Southwest Soldier King. Although Han Sen was not that interested in the title, he must beat Tie Yi. The position of the guard could not be given to anyone but himself.

Zheng Yuze's fight began first, which gave Han Sen more time to rest.

After fighting another soldier for more than half an hour, Zheng Yuze won. If Han Sen could beat Tie Yi, he would battle Zheng Yuze for the title of Southwest Soldier King.

It was Han Sen's turn. Han Sen moved around and felt the sore was relieved a lot.

He had been using Jadeskin for the past half an hour, relieving his fatigue. It seemed that the effect was quite good.

Tie Yi walked up, standing opposite Han Sen. Han Sen was tall himself, while Tie Yi was a foot taller than him, bringing lots of pressure.

However, Han Sen did not feel much. He had seen creatures as tall as skyscrapers and he was never scared, not to mention Tie Yi was only a foot taller.

When the whistle was blown, Han Sen stepped out and punched at Tie Yi's chest.

However, Tie Yi stood still, looking at Han Sen with contempt. His body turned gold like the Buddha. It was as if he had become a statue.

It turned out that Tie Yi was trying to use Super Diamond Body to take Han Sen's punch and did not mean to block it at all, which made many soldiers of Southwest Galaxy hiss, pissed by the arrogance of Tie Yi.
