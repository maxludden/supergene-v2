<p>Pang!</p>
<p>Han Sen’s body exploded as the blades sliced through it. Another
Han Sen rushed Dragon Fifteen from the side.</p>
<p>Dragon Fifteen flapped his wings, creating a moon-shaped swirl
of water. He ran at Han Sen with his cold dragon claws raised to
strike Han Sen’s heart. Dragon Fifteen hadn’t planned on
immediately securing the scale; his primary objective was to kill
Han Sen.</p>
<p>The Evilbreaker powers raced toward Han Sen. Even with Han Sen’s
speed, avoiding those claws would be difficult. Pang!</p>
<p>Han Sen’s body was cut to ribbons, but it was just another Moon
clone.</p>
<p>Dragon Fifteen turned to the Dragon God’s body. Han Sen floated
near the corpse as he stuffed the scale into his pocket.</p>
<p>Dragon Fifteen came at Han Sen furiously, but Han Sen swam away
with the grace of a fish. He was swimming at a pace much greater
than Dragon Fifteen was capable of.</p>
<p>Han Sen put some distance between Dragon Fifteen and himself,
but just as he started to relax, a lance came at him through the
water. It was Long Ying.</p>
<p>Han Sen knew now that he had been tricked. Long Ying had not
left, and her departure was only to lure him out.</p>
<p>“Nice plan.” Han Sen did not have time to think. The lance light
covered a radius of a hundred meters beneath that sea, keeping him
from escaping. There was nothing Han Sen could do, so he pulled out
his Blood Feather Knife and used his knife and sword powers. He
blocked the lance that was coming for him.</p>
<p>Long Ying wanted to prevent Han Sen’s escape, so she cast many
more lance lights. Each of the lance powers was weakened,
however.</p>
<p>But every time Han Sen used his knife to deflect the lance
light, the impact bounced him away. His chest felt like it was
getting struck by lightning, and the pain was fierce.</p>
<p>Han Sen wasn’t bleeding yet, though. He tried to use those
impacts to toss him further away from Long Ying. But Dragon Fifteen
was already behind him, and when his Evilbreaker claws came for Han
Sen, they tried to snare him like an ugly net.</p>
<p>Han Sen’s vision suddenly flashed into a view of sequence
structures composed of molecules. He kept swinging his Blood
Feather Knife, striking back against the claw light. He managed to
break it, and then it turned into nothing. Not stopping, Han Sen
continued his flight into the deeper reaches of the sea.</p>
<p>Dragon Fifteen and Long Ying paused for a moment, stunned that
an Earl had been able to break Dragon Fifteen’s claw light. Dragon
Fifteen had recognized the Blood Feather Knife, and his face
darkened.</p>
<p>“That is Han Sen! Do not let him flee.”</p>
<p>“I won’t let him escape again.” Long Ying looked cold. She
became a dragon xenogeneic, and she flapped her dragon wings in
pursuit of Han Sen.</p>
<p>As Han Sen fled, he continuously swung his knife to weave knife
silks into the water.</p>
<p>Long Ying kept coming, though, cutting through the knife silks
as she moved. The knife silks were unable to do anything to her
Duke xenogeneic body.</p>
<p>Dong!</p>
<p>Long Ying attacked Han Sen again. That lance power was stronger
than the previous attack. Han Sen’s Blood Feather Knife almost
couldn’t withstand it, and his body rocketed down into the sea bed.
He sank into the crater the impact had formed, and the sand and
rocks rose to cover his shape.</p>
<p>“Escaping won’t be that easy.” Long Ying spun her lance into a
blur, forming a vortex in the water. All the sand and rocks were
sucked away from Han Sen’s hiding place, clearing the water.</p>
<p>Han Sen had planned to escape under the cover of the sand, but
now he was visible, and the vortex slowed down his movements. He
couldn’t escape quickly.</p>
<p>Dragon Fifteen caught up. Her claw lights flashed at Han Sen
like a meteor shower.</p>
<p>Han Sen decided to stop fighting the current and allow the water
to jerk him towards Dragon Fifteen. He used his Blood Feather Knife
alongside Super Spank.</p>
<p>Dragon Fifteen did not wish to fight Han Sen, though. He started
to fall back, swinging his claws as he went. The Blood Feather
Knife broke every claw into dust, but it took too much time. Long
Ying was again in front of Han Sen, with an attack prepped.</p>
<p>Han Sen used his knife with Super Spank powers, and he almost
broke the lance’s sequence structure. But the lance knocked Han Sen
away, all the same. Something in his chest tore and blood spilled
out of his mouth and nose.</p>
<p>Long Ying and Dragon Fifteen did not let Han Sen rest. They kept
up a continuous string of attacks.</p>
<p>If Dragon Fifteen had been there alone, Han Sen could have
fought him off. Long Ying was not a strong Duke, but her level was
still equal to a xenogeneic Sharon. Han Sen didn’t have much of a
chance.</p>
<p>Han Sen used his Moon clones to absorb a few attacks, but things
were taking a turn for the worse. A lance was eventually able to
break his armor and thrust into his shoulder.</p>
<p>Han Sen’s movements slowed as he sustained more and more
injuries. Dragon Fifteen’s claws were able to land on Han Sen,
digging in a few bloody trenches into his back.</p>
<p>Long Ying’s lance flashed furiously. It struck whenever Han Sen
was distracted by Dragon Fifteen’s attacks.</p>
<p>Han Sen gritted his teeth and suppressed the pain from his
wounds. He lifted the Blood Feather Knife to repel Long Ying’s
lance.</p>
<p>Duke powers were scary. After that hit, Han Sen was knocked to
the bottom of the sea again. Blood came oozing out of him.</p>
<p>The sand and debris rose, and Long Ying used her lance to clear
the area again. Han Sen’s body had formed a deep hole. But when
Dragon Fifteen and Long Ying cleared the hole all the way to the
bottom, they were shocked. Han Sen was not there.</p>
<p>They searched for Han Sen, but he was gone. It was as if he had
vanished into thin air.</p>
<p>Dragon Fifteen looked like fury incarnate. Han Sen had just
vanished and taken the half-deified Upside-Down Scale with him.</p>
<p>“Send word. Find Han Sen, even if you have to drain the Return
Ruin Sea. Bring him to me, dead or alive.” Dragon Fifteen looked
cold.</p>
<p>Long Ying was depressed. She couldn’t figure out how Han Sen had
escaped.</p>
<p>Long Ying did not need to leave the water to contact others of
their race. She got on her phone and spread the news. Help came to
move Dragon God’s body, and she ordered other Dragons and
xenogeneics to search for Han Sen throughout the Return Ruin
Sea.</p>
<p>Han Sen’s body appeared in a house in the Alliance, but he
started coughing up blood as soon as he arrived.</p>
<p>The powers of an Earl were weak. Unless he used super god
spirit, he’d be unable to match a Duke. So, he came back to the
Alliance.</p>
<p>“It is lucky I brought the scale back with me. Otherwise, it
would have been a grand loss.” Han Sen licked his lips as he
stroked the blue Upside-Down Scale.</p>
