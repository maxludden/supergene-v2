The fight between Han Sen and the Armored Man was Han Sen’s fourth fight Aside from Sacred’s master, Han Sen also defeated two other Son of God’s. Though he defeated them, his performance seemed to pale in comparison to the Armored Man.

The Armored Man didn’t have to fight at all, as all his opponents immediately conceded. Han Sen wasn’t as frightening as he was.

All the creatures were speculating on whether Dollar would actually dare to fight the Armored Man.

Han Sen didn’t think about it that much. He was still practicing the Dongxuan Sutra like usual, hoping that he could advance Bulwark Umbrella to super level.

Ji Yanran went to the company. Han Sen, Littleflower, and Bao’er were at home. Littleflower and Bao’er were playing in the garden, while Han Sen was practicing the Dongxuan Sutra.

In the afternoon, Ji Yanran still hadn’t come back yet. She was very busy in the company, and she needed to do overtime in the afternoon. Han Sen thought about it, and then he took Littleflower and Bao’er to the street for some food.

“Father, I want ice cream,” Bao’er said happily, holding Han Sen’s neck.

“Okay, since your mom is not here, let’s get wild today. You can eat whatever you want until you are full,” said Han Sen, smiling.

“Yeah!” Bao’er cheered.

Han Sen didn’t want to drive them to the shops himself. It was much easier to just ride there. They arrived at the street, and they stepped onto the automatic portal, arriving at the business center.

The three ate happily, and they toured all the restaurants and food stands. Han Sen wasn’t afraid that Bao’er and Littleflower would get food poisoning. Their bodies were strong enough to resist even real poison, not to mention ordinary food.

Littleflower was only one year old, but he could already eat a lot, a lot more than ordinary adults. However, he was very polite and quiet, and he was very elegant even when eating food.

After eating, Han Sen went to the bathroom, and he put Bao’er and Littleflower in the children’s entertainment area. Bao’er and Littleflower sat on small chairs as they played.

Suddenly, a lady walked toward the children’s entertainment zone, and she arrived at the doors. She was stopped by the Al. “Lady, you didn’t put a child here. Is there anything I can help you with?” said the Al to the woman.

“Of course.” The lady put her hands on the Al, and the machine exploded.

Nobody panicked because of the explosion. The entire children’s entertainment area seemed to have been cut off from the building. Everything happening here seemed to have nothing to do with the building anymore, and everyone overlooked the area.

Other kids were still playing, but Bao’er suddenly jumped off the seesaw. She walked to Littleflower, and she stared at the woman walking toward her with her large eyes.

“You can actually sense me coming. It seems that you’re not just a pet for companionship,” said the lady as she looked at Bao’er, smiling.

“Please leave now, sister. My dad is very ferocious. He doesn’t like women. If he sees you here when he comes back, he’ll be angry and kill you.” Bao’er stood in front of Littleflower and looked at the lady.

“Then I’ll leave soon. I don’t like men who are very ferocious either. I only like boys who are cute and beautiful,” the woman said while she moved her body. She teleported beside Littleflower and reached toward his collar.

Bao’er immediately grabbed Littleflower and jumped up. She dodged the woman’s palms and rushed toward the exit of the children’s entertainment zone.

The woman was surprised. “Those people are idiots. Their intelligence is completely wrong. A pet for companionship? Even ordinary top-tier demigods are not this fast.”

Peng!

As Bao’er tried to run out of the children’s entertainment zone with Littleflower, they seemed to hit an invisible wall, and they bounced back immediately.

The woman smiled and walked toward them. “Even if you’re a pet at the demigod level, it’s still useless. If you don’t want to be killed, stand there and don’t move.”

“Sister Bao’er doesn’t want to die, but if I lose my brother, my father will beat me to death. You’re so beautiful, so you must be a very good person. Help me, okay? Don’t take my brother away,” Bao’er begged, looking at the woman.

“What a cute pet. I just want to take you back… And eat you.” The woman licked her lips. Her tongue was long and thin like a snake’s, and it looked absolutely bizarre.

“Bao’er is still very young, so I don’t have that much flesh for you to eat. How about you wait for a few years, and when I grow up, you can come to eat me,” Bao’er said with her eyes wide open.

Littleflower looked at the woman curiously.

“You’re so smart, but there’s no use in stalling for time. Even if you are one of Han Sen’s beast souls, you can’t get through my Sen Luo illusion to contact him. Don’t even think about it,” the woman said while moved her body again, teleporting over to grab Littleflower.

Bao’er grabbed Littleflower, and she was extremely quick. The woman teleported several times, but she still couldn’t touch Littleflower, so she was upset.

She looked at Bao’er for a second. The woman then said, “Those people are all useless. They actually think a powerful pet like this is only for companionship. I’ll have to ask the instructor to punish them when I go back.”

And then, black and purple smoke started coming out of her body, filling the entire children’s zone. The smoke looked like threads, and they moved toward Bao’er and Littleflower.

There was black and purple smoke everywhere, so Bao’er and Littleflower didn’t even have a place to move anymore.

The black smoke touched other children, and it bound them like ropes. The kids were all falling down on the ground.

Some kids were terrified and wanted to cry, but they found that after they were bound by the black and purple smoke, they couldn’t even cry out loud because their mouths seemed to be sealed shut. They could only cry silently with their eyes wide open.

The black and purple smoke that looked like hands sealed all avenues of escape for Bao’er and Littleflower, and then it started to attack them.

Bao’er slapped her palm, and then a small gourd showed up in her hands. She held it toward the black and purple smoke, and then the smoke was quickly sucked into the gourd.

“What is that? Is that a Geno core? How can a beast soul have a geno
