    <p>
      The group that had been betrayed were nothing more than skeletal husks
      now, frail shadows of their former selves that clung to the most meager
      tethers of life. They were so brittle and aged, they could not even stand.
    </p>
    <p>“Come. Deliver thine blood,” Mister Li coldly said.</p>
    <p>
      “What happens if the coffin is… revived?” Han Sen wanted to continue
      feigning he was a member and avoid invoking the ire of the possible-leader
      of Blood Legion, but he feared what might happen if he was to give his
      blood.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mister Li walked over to Han Sen and grabbed him by the neck, then dragged
      him over to the eerie sarcophagus. Han Sen hadn’t realized what was
      happening until it was too late; he had no hope of avoiding the man’s
      grasp.
    </p>
    <p>
      But it wasn’t an ordinary grip that held his neck, either. He felt the
      tingling sensation of electrical currents running through his body,
      paralyzing his ability to resist. It was like he was suddenly chained up.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mister Li pushed Han Sen down on the coffin and readied himself to slit
      Han Sen’s throat with his dirty, overgrown fingernails. Han Sen swiftly
      understood the direness of the situation, and so his eyes flashed white.
      His black hair became a gown of milky silk. His body glowed brightly.
    </p>
    <p>
      With that strength, Han Sen did not hesitate to pull away and perform
      Super Spank on Mister Li.
    </p>
    <p>Pang!</p>
    <p>
      Mister Li stumbled backwards in shock, staring at Han Sen and his new
      form.
    </p>
    <p>
      Unfortunately, Han Sen was unable to break Mister Li’s sequence structure.
      Trying to do that was like trying to pry steel with bare hands. He had
      gotten free as he had hoped, but he could hardly believe how strong he
      was. Mister Li had to have the strength of a super creature.
    </p>
    <p>
      Han Sen turned around and began to flee. He knew he’d die if he tried to
      remain and fight an enemy so far beyond his own abilities.
    </p>
    <p>
      “The power he possesses is magnificent, but unbridled and not honed.
      Still, the coffin demands the sacrifice,” Mister Li spoke aloud coldly, as
      he moved forward to catch Han Sen.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Han Sen knew he wouldn’t be allowed to leave so easily, and he was
      prepared to react when the moment was right. When the full extent of the
      powers given by his super king spirit mode was enabled, he was faster than
      a sudden bolt of lightning.
    </p>
    <p>
      With his Bulwark Umbrella, Han Sen shielded himself from Mister Li’s
      incoming grip and summoned his crystal egg.
    </p>
    <p>Boom!</p>
    <p>
      Mister Li came into contact with the umbrella with the force of a comet.
      The umbrella cracked, and the crash of the impact sent Han Sen hurtling
      through the air. The egg was headed in Mister Li’s direction as this
      occurred, but it did nothing. Mister Li grabbed the egg and with the sound
      of a pang, crushed it in his hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      Still, this prompted the Jade Skeleton to appear. The pigmy was quick to
      scramble out of its ruined shell, and it delivered Mister Li a firm punch
      before flying over to Han Sen.
    </p>
    <p>
      This was an unexpected turn of events which took Mister Li by surprise,
      and where his palm had been struck by the creepy little skeleton, he had
      turned to crystal. This crater in his palm began to expand and web across
      the entirety of his hand and beyond, turning him into a jade-like statue.
    </p>
    <p>
      Over the course of a few seconds, though, Mister Li’s body turned entirely
      blue. It overlapped the spreading jade and vanquished it, removing the
      effect of the pigmy’s punch.
    </p>
    <p>
      “That is rare! You are the first I have witnessed use such powers in a
      sanctuary.” Despite his desire to slit Han Sen’s throat as a sacrifice,
      Mister Li complimented him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Survival was the best Han Sen could hope for in such a dire situation, but
      he couldn’t contemplate a way in which he might ensure a getaway. Han
      Sen’s power was far inferior to Mister Li’s, and he only possessed bronze
      geno cores. There was no hope of fighting back, or even repelling the man.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Why are the people in Blood Legion struggling to adapt to life in the
      sanctuaries?” Han Sen asked, wanting to stall his nemesis.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mister Li knew Han Sen was asking nonsense, hoping to buy himself time.
      But he answered anyway, saying, “Blood Legion members can absorb geno
      points, but they cannot possess special powers. While we can use geno
      points to become stronger, it is impossible for us to change our elemental
      alignment. Your blood is too light and impure, which is why you can do so
      like the rest. Who are you? Which generation do you belong to?”
    </p>
    <p>“You know my name is Han,” Han Sen said.</p>
    <p>
      “There is no one named Han amongst the thirteen.” Mister Li looked
      genuinely curious.
    </p>
    <p>
      “There was; my great-grandfather was called Han Jinzhi,” Han Sen said.
    </p>
    <p>
      “That is impossible! He joined the legion, but he was an outsider. His
      heirs cannot possess holy blood,” Mister Li denied.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now Han Sen was thinking Nan Litian and Baby Ghost were telling the truth,
      and Han Jinzhi had been forced into Blood Legion.
    </p>
    <p>
      “If you say he is an outsider, why would he possess the relic?” As Han Sen
      spoke, Han Sen employed his Dongxuan Aura to determine the best possible
      escape route he could use. While doing this, Han Sen noticed the Nine-Life
      Cat sitting upon the palace’s rooftop. It was staring right back at him,
      swinging its tail.
    </p>
    <p>“It’s still here?” Han Sen did not expect to see it there.</p>
    <p>
      Mister Li answered the former question by telling him, “If you know of the
      relic, you must belong to the lineage of one of the thirteen. Are you from
      the Qin family, perhaps?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “How did you know?” Han Sen pretended, with a put-on tone of exaggerated
      surprise.
    </p>
    <p>
      “The Qin family left Blood Legion a long time ago, so light sacred blood
      is to be expected.” Mister Li paused for a moment, before saying, “I
      cannot believe the Qin family is returning to the legion. This is a most
      splendid thing to learn.”
