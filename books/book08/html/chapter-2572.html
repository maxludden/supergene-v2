<p>“Are you mistaken? Isn’t she one of the Sky? Why does it say she
is one of the Very High?” Han Sen asked Glasses in his mind. He was
trying to keep his surprise under wraps while he read through the
rest of the report.</p>
<p>“Target: Very High female. Gene Age Calculation: 23 years”</p>
<p>“Gene level: Ninth-tier King”</p>
<p>“Gene potential: 5 stars”</p>
<p>“Crystal Furnace Database has a lot of gene data concerning the
Very High. Based on the target’s genes, her genes match the Very
High profile at a rate of 87.675%. The genes that associate her
with the Sky compose 0.3% of her form. Likelihood of target being a
member of the Very High is 99.99%,” Glasses answered.</p>
<p>Han Sen believed it. He already knew that Exquisite was
ninth-tier King, which proved that Glasses wasn’t talking
nonsense.</p>
<p>“Right. I never heard about Li Keer and Exquisite in Sky Palace
because they don’t belong to the Sky,” Han Sen surmised.</p>
<p>“Then what does their gene potential mean? What is the highest
star rating achievable?” Han Sen asked.</p>
<p>“The gene potential means how much a creature can grow.
According to the Crystal Furnace Database, there are ten stars in
total,” Glasses answered.</p>
<p>“No way. There are ten stars in total and a member of the Very
High only has five?” Han Sen was very suspicious about these
results due to the fact that the Very High were one of the
strongest races in the entire universe. Even if their genes weren’t
the best, they shouldn’t have been as low as five stars.</p>
<p>“What are you doing, waiting around here?” Exquisite asked with
a frown. Han Sen was just standing there staring at her.</p>
<p>“It’s nothing. I was just thinking of a way to get out of here,”
Han Sen said.</p>
<p>“So, did you think of a way?” Exquisite asked.</p>
<p>“No.” Han Sen shook his head.</p>
<p>“Then let’s just wait for rescue. We have been missing for a
while. Our people will probably think of a way to save us,”
Exquisite said. Then, she left.</p>
<p>Han Sen opened his mouth. He wanted to ask if she was one of the
Very High, but if she was choosing not to divulge that information
herself, there had to be a reason. He knew that very well,
considering that he didn’t go around telling everyone that he was a
human. With that in mind, he decided not to ask.</p>
<p>“For a king, five stars is top class. Only deifieds start at six
stars for analysis,” Glasses answered.</p>
<p>“I see. How many stars do I have?” Han Sen asked out of
curiosity.</p>
<p>“Collecting data… analyzing data… analyzing…” Glasses’ data
collection started going through the motions, except this time it
was taking far longer.</p>
<p>“Genes are unstable… Cannot confirm… Cannot confirm…” The data
collection kept going on, and it didn’t seem as if it was going to
stop.</p>
<p>“It doesn’t matter, I suppose. There is no need to continue
testing,” Han Sen said. Glasses had continued to say “cannot
confirm,” which Han Sen found annoying.</p>
<p>Glasses quieted down and the data on the screen vanished.</p>
<p>“Right, let’s go and see how the big and little Crocodile Gods
rank on this thing,” Han Sen thought. His heart already beating a
little faster, Han Sen headed for the swimming pool.</p>
<p>Han Sen saw the big Crocodile God still asleep on the sunbathing
chair with Li Keer massaging its head. Curiosity rose in Han Sen,
and he found himself wanting to test out Li Keer first.</p>
<p>The results were similar to Exquisite’s, and it turned out that
Li Keer was one of the Very High, too. She also had five stars, but
she was younger. According to the crystallizers’ gene calculations,
Li Keer was only sixteen.</p>
<p>“This time, I believe you.” Han Sen turned and looked at the big
Crocodile God. He saw the icons spinning as the device collected
data, but after a while passed, it hadn’t come up with any
results.</p>
<p>“There’s no way you cannot analyze that.” Han Sen started to
doubt whether or not the glasses were working properly. But then,
he saw the image and data of the Crocodile God appear.</p>
<p>Target: Gravity Crocodile God female. Gene Age Calculation:
1.365 billion years</p>
<p>Gene Level: Transmutation Deified</p>
<p>Gene potential: 7 star</p>
<p>“Your analysis is so inaccurate. A deified of the transmutation
rank only has a potential of seven stars?” Han Sen was doubting the
analysis Glasses was providing again.</p>
<p>“Gravity Crocodile God’s genes are only four stars. There is a
limit to the rank that it can achieve. It cannot become fully
deified because, even after modification, its gene potential will
only rise to seven stars. It can never exceed the rank of
transmutation. If there are no gene mutations, the chance of
reaching larva class is one-in-a-billion.”</p>
<p>“Seriously? You have that much deified data to compare with?”
Han Sen asked skeptically.</p>
<p>“This is the result after comparisons with the samples of other
deified creatures. According to the database, without a nine-star
potential, a deified creature can never become a true god,” Glasses
answered.</p>
<p>Han Sen looked at the little Crocodile God with much suspicion.
Glasses worked again, and the data symbols started to spin.</p>
<p>After a while, Han Sen was finally able to read the results.</p>
<p>Target: Gravity Crocodile God male. Gene Age Calculation: one
month, seven days.</p>
<p>Gene Level: Primitive Deified</p>
<p>Gene Potential: 9 stars</p>
<p>“Holy shit! This guy is a Gravity Crocodile God. Why does it
have nine stars?” Han Sen asked.</p>
<p>“This Gravity Crocodile God was born deified. Its genes mutated,
becoming far better than the old ones. According to the genes
shared, they must be mother and son.”</p>
<p>“Seriously? This small thing has the potential to become a true
god?” Han Sen looked at the small Crocodile God with a fire in his
eyes.</p>
<p>The little Crocodile God realized Han Sen was staring at it. So,
it looked at Han Sen with disdain. But Exquisite was still
scrubbing the creature’s scales, so it didn’t do anything.</p>
<p>“A nine-star deified xenogeneic can become a true god, but it
isn’t guaranteed,” Glasses answered.</p>
<p>Han Sen ignored Glasses as he tried to think of a way to kidnap
the small Crocodile God. That thing could one day become a true
god.</p>
<p>But Han Sen remembered that he couldn’t take a core xenogeneic
away from there. So, kidnapping would be pointless.</p>
<p>After considering the results delivered by Glasses, Han Sen
decided to place his faith in them. If the crystallizers had
designed this device by themselves, they wouldn’t have been able to
gather so much data on deified creatures.</p>
<p>But the elders of the crystallizers helped Sacred Leader analyze
The Story of Genes. And they eventually took over the sanctuaries.
Han Sen believed they must have received some data from Sacred.</p>
<p>For someone like Sacred Leader, it wouldn’t have been too
difficult to collect data on deified beings. Back then, the Very
High and Ancient God were far below Sacred. The Extreme King were
servants of Sacred. If Sacred Leader wanted their gene data, it
would have been very easy for him to collect it.</p>
<p>After all, gathering gene data didn’t require the deaths of the
deifieds. It would only require a hair or a small sample of DNA. If
Sacred Leader wanted a strand of hair, who would dare to turn down
his request?</p>
<p>Now, Han Sen just wanted to go home and try it out on his baby
daughter Ling’er. He wanted to see how much gene potential she
had.</p>
<p>But as long as he was under the control of the big and little
Crocodile Gods, he couldn’t go anywhere. Leaving wasn’t an option
just yet. Han Sen was going to remain patient and keep cleaning up
the fortress in case there was anything else there for him to find.
Glasses only scanned, analyzed, and compared. It didn’t do anything
else.</p>
