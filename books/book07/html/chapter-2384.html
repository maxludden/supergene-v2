<h2>The Alpha’s Water Fairy</h2>

<p>Everyone had a unique personality. Even if two people practiced
the same sword skills, their swordminds would develop based on
their individualities. Despite starting from the same base, the
resulting swordminds might be very different.</p>
<p>Han Sen had a very different personality from the man who had
created the Proud Bone Swordmind. Because they were so completely
different, there was an extreme gap between their swordminds. Han
Sen was having a very hard time trying to understand the Proud Bone
swordmind.</p>
<p>Both the name “Mad Sword” and “Proud Bone” were very
representative of the man’s character. He had been a very proud and
very wild person. He approached problems and came up with solutions
in a very different manner than Han Sen.</p>
<p>Han Sen’s swordmind was based on tenacity. No matter what
endeavor Han Sen undertook, whether it was gravely important or
exceedingly trivial, he finished what he started. His determination
carried him continually forward, but sometimes he was so focused on
his goals that he could miss out on the views along the way.</p>
<p>As long as Han Sen could reach his goal, he was willing to
follow whichever path would get him there in the end. This aspect
of his character sometimes made him seem lackadaisical and
uncaring. He seemed to change plans easily, as if he was okay with
everything and nothing really mattered to him. But in reality, Han
Sen never shifted from his true purpose; he was just willing to
adapt his plans as many times as necessary in order to achieve that
purpose.</p>
<p>Han Sen, who seemed like such a casual individual, was actually
more stubborn than most. But the things he stubbornly pursued were
so far in the future that other people couldn’t see them. That was
why others thought he showed little concern over the things around
him.</p>
<p>Mad Sword was different. Mad Sword wasn’t obsessed with an end
goal; he cared more about the experience of the journey itself.
Ironically, though, he was the most unique and noticeable thing on
most of the roads he traveled.</p>
<p>Born pretty to die pretty. That was what Mad Sword was looking
for.</p>
<p>Two different personalities and two different lives. Neither of
them was right or wrong. They were just the decisions made by
separate people. If Han Sen wanted to learn Mad Sword’s Proud Bone
Swordmind, he would have to give up his own faith and purpose to
properly understand the faith that Mad Sword placed in his own
beliefs. Han Sen could do that, but he didn’t want to.</p>
<p>Despite this massive disconnect between them, Han Sen still
wanted to gain something from the swordmind. It would be much
harder for him than for others, who could simply accept Mad Sword’s
swordmind for what it was.</p>
<p>Half the day had passed by this point, and the swordminds of
some of the royal children were starting to reflect the five words,
“Pride and bones are made.” They had been able to achieve a
lot.</p>
<p>The most obvious was Bai Ling Shuang. Her swordmind was
connecting with the carved script. The swordmind was melding into
her body, and with its power, it also brought a certain
arrogance.</p>
<p>Han Sen was surprised. Bai Ling Shuang was talented, but she
definitely wasn’t the best of the royal children who had made it to
the top of the mountain. But since she had achieved so much
already, her personality was a fine match for the Proud Bone
Swordmind.</p>
<p>“It looks like I have wasted my time here.” Han Sen sighed. He
had been unable to tap into the Proud Bone Swordmind.</p>
<p>It was like when a lazy person failed to understand a
workaholic. Their thoughts didn’t operate on the same wavelength.
They were so different that they could never be the same.</p>
<p>In the end, Han Sen gave up trying to learn the Proud Bone
Swordmind. No matter how strong it was, it didn’t match his own
personality.</p>
<p>Han Sen had to take Bai Ling Shuang back down, though. Waiting
around for her was boring, and he quickly grew uncomfortable as he
sat around doing nothing. So, he started playing with his jade
gourd. He also summoned his water fairy.</p>
<p>Han Sen intended to have the water fairy give him a massage, so
he could wait for Bai Ling Shuang in a more comfortable fashion
until it was time to leave. Once they reached the bottom, he could
lay claim to the other fifty King class genes he had been promised.
But when the water fairy emerged from the gourd, she looked
straight at the carved words. She stood on the spot, completely
unmoving.</p>
<p>Just as Han Sen noticed her strange behavior, the water fairy’s
body began to change. The liquid within his translucent form
swirled slowly, shifting in almost imperceptible ways.</p>
<p>Most of the changes that took place in the water fairy’s
appearance were minute, but when he looked at her again, she seemed
like a completely different person. Even her powers had altered
radically.</p>
<p>The water fairy had originally been as soft as water. She could
listen to someone’s complaints without becoming perturbed, just
like a maid.</p>
<p>But after these small changes, the water fairy looked as cold as
ice. Her whole body was like a sharp and powerful sword.</p>
<p>Han Sen looked at the water fairy, and he thought her power
actually seemed rather familiar.</p>
<p>“Pride and bones are made,” Han Sen murmured to himself. He had
realized why she now looked so familiar; it was because the water
fairy’s new power reminded him of the five words carved into the
knoll. The Proud Bone Swordmind seemed to radiate from her
form.</p>
<p>“What is going on?” Han Sen asked in pleased astonishment.</p>
<p>In all the time that had passed since he first discovered the
water fairy, Han Sen hadn’t figured out what the water fairy could
do. He usually used her as a maid, but now, she seemed to possess a
power that was beyond his imagination.</p>
<p>The water fairy’s changes continued. The less-obvious the
changes became, the more her powers altered. And not long after,
when Han Sen looked at the water fairy, she had become a
personification of the words, “Pride and bones are made.” She
looked exactly like the real Proud Bone Swordmind. It was
remarkable.</p>
<p>Fortunately, Han Sen was sitting behind most of the royal
children, and they were too focused on learning the swordmind to
pay attention to him, anyway. If any of them had seen the water
fairy undergoing those changes, they would have been astounded.</p>
<p>The swordmind was something that could only be felt, not
embodied. It wasn’t like a geno art or some piece of scientific
knowledge that could be written down as words.</p>
<p>It couldn’t even be drawn or photographed. It was a sensation
that had to be felt inside oneself. It couldn’t be copied with any
form of tool.</p>
<p>But the water fairy somehow did the impossible; she copied the
words to embody the Proud Bone Swordmind. If a deified elite had
seen what she did, they would have reacted the same way that Han
Sen was.</p>
<p>A while later, the changes within the water fairy finished. Her
power and swordmind had completely transformed into the Proud Bone
Swordmind.</p>
<p>“It is perfect! Perfect!” Han Sen complimented. The water fairy
had copied that power like a cheater. Han Sen had never heard of
any other treasure being able to do something like this.</p>
<p>As Han Sen thought about how lucky he was to have the jade gourd
and water fairy, the water fairy suddenly moved over to Han Sen.
She placed her hands on Han Sen’s chest and made her water body
suddenly blend into his own.</p>
<p>“What is this?” Han Sen wondered. Then, a foreign swordmind
suddenly flowed into his body. He recognized it instantly; it was
the Proud Bone Swordmind.</p>
<p>Han Sen realized what had just happened. The water fairy wasn’t
just copying the mind. She could take that mind and gift it to the
master of the jade gourd. Then, the jade gourd master could feel
the swordmind in his own body.</p>
<p>The swordmind might have been incompatible with him, but now it
was deep within his mind, under his control. Rather than simply
seeing the foreign swordmind, now he could experience every facet
of it. There was no better way to learn than experience.</p>
<p>It was better to travel than it was to study. The water fairy
could take an abstract idea and make it real and tangible.</p>
<p>“I never would have guessed that the alpha’s treasure would be
this strong. It’s almost too powerful,” Han Sen thought as a wide
grin spread over his mouth.</p>
