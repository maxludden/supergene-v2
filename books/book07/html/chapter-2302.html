<p>Out of all the royal children, it was rare for someone like Bai Wei—especially at her age—to not have visited The Grave of Soldiers and Kings.</p>

<p>This wasn’t a negative commentary on Bai Wei’s skill, however. If she went to The Grave of Soldiers and Kings alone, she would have to be at least King class to pass the test.</p>

<p>The test in The Grave of Soldiers and Kings allowed the help of royal guards. Bai King had created a few of the tests to focus on the personal power of the royal children, but most of the tests focused on the collective power of the team.</p>

<p>To become an emperor, a person could not rely solely on their own power. Emperors needed the skill and authority to control others effectively.</p>

<p>The strongest ally that Bai Wei had was her butler. There were some other Marquise and Earl servants and knights in her employ, but Han Sen was her only official Royal Guard.</p>

<p>Bai Wei was having a bad time because Planet Wind Zone did not have enough resources to support the development of high-level knights. No one remotely powerful would follow a lowly royal like her.</p>

<p>On top of all that, Bai Wei wasn’t held in high esteem by the common people. Because of that, the people who were willing to follow her weren’t particularly outstanding.</p>

<p>The Grave of Soldiers and Kings allowed a royal to bring ten Royal Guards with them, but the guards had to be ranked Duke or lower. Han Sen’s plan to bring the blood kirin was shot down immediately.</p>

<p>“So, that means the only people that are useful here are you, me, and the butler.” Han Sen frowned.</p>

<p>Bai Wei shook her head. “Just you and me, actually. Not the butler. The butler isn’t a Royal Guard, so he isn’t qualified to enter The Grave of Soldiers and Kings.”</p>

<p>Han Sen gave her a wry smile. “You are using me as a stand-in for all ten Royal Guards? I should take the combined cut you’d give all ten, then.”</p>

<p>“If we can get into The Grave of Soldiers and Kings, I will go half and half on the spoils with you,” Bai Wei said.</p>

<p>“The Grave of Soldiers and Kings contains the weaponry of kings. Only one of the royals can take the stuff. How are we supposed to split what we find?” Han Sen asked.</p>

<p>Bai Wei laughed. “Of course you cannot take a king’s weapon, but the Grave contains more than just royal weapons. Otherwise, the princes and princesses would have taken it all away already. Many weapons have been left there simply to honor the dead. They are rare treasures, and Royal Guards are each allowed to take one of them. That way, you and I will both be able to take something.”</p>

<p>Upon hearing that he could gain something from this venture, Han Sen felt much better.</p>

<p>Bai Wei went on to say, “Plus, The Grave of Soldiers and Kings has more to offer than simply weapons. Passing through The Grave of Soldiers and Kings will qualify me to study in the King’s Garden. That is the true benefit I seek. Royal Guards can follow me there to study, so that should be something that interests you, as well.”</p>

<p>Although Han Sen had only just come to the Extreme King, he had heard about the King’s Garden before. There was a deified king tree there, and it was native to the King’s Kingdom. In the daytime, the king tree released king air. Absorbing the king air could strengthen your body and genes. It was very helpful for nobles who wanted to level up.</p>

<p>But the king tree only released a limited amount of king air. Even royals were required to pass certain tests before they could enter the King’s Garden and obtain some of the king air.</p>

<p>Access to The Grave of Soldiers and Kings was one of the requirements for entry. There were many other conditions, but Bai Wei had already met them. Passing through The Grave of Soldiers and Kings was the only challenge that Bai Wei been unsuccessful in completing.</p>

<p>Han Sen didn’t know what the test inside The Grave would be like. He couldn’t promise Bai Wei that he could lead her through it successfully, so he planned on just having a look first.</p>

<p>However, both Bai Wei and Han Sen were Duke class. She was confident in being able to enter The Grave of Soldiers and Kings.</p>

<p>Han Sen left Bao’er, the blood kirin, and the little red bird behind on Planet Wind Area. Then, Han Sen and Bai Wei journeyed to The Grave.</p>

<p>The Grave of Soldiers and Kings was a planet. Han Sen and Bai Wei reached a space station in orbit above the planet, and Bai Wei completed the documentation while Han Sen waited in the lobby.</p>

<p>“This poor queen. She has to do everything by herself.” Han Sen sighed. He closed his eyes and tried to get a little rest. But he suddenly felt someone approach.</p>

<p>Many people were coming and going from the lobby, but that person’s presence caught Han Sen’s attention. He opened his eyes.</p>

<p>It was a twenty-year-old man with an ordinary Extreme King face. His eyes were very stable. His whole body was like a knife that could be pulled out of a scabbard.</p>

<p>The man walked straight up to Han Sen. He stopped in front of Han Sen, his gaze direct. “You are Han Sen?”</p>

<p>“I am. What is your name?” Han Sen asked warily. He had only just come to the Extreme King, but already someone was looking for him.</p>

<p>“Bai Wuchang,” the young man answered seriously.</p>

<p>Hearing that name, Han Sen was surprised. He thought, “This name is a bomb. I wonder what genius decided to give his son such an awesome name. Are they not afraid their son might die?”</p>

<p>Bai Wuchang ignored Han Sen’s hesitation. “Are you the Han Sen that is affiliated with Lone Bamboo. The one with the title of knife and sword master?”</p>

<p>“I am that Han Sen, but that title is just a name people use to make fun of me. You cannot take it seriously,” Han Sen said.</p>

<p>Bai Wuchang nodded. “That’s fine, as long as you are the one. I wanted to fight Lone Bamboo, but I’ve never gotten the chance. Since you are here, I will fight you first.”</p>

<p>Bai Wuchang pulled a card out of his pocket and gave it to Han Sen. “Take this card. I will wait for you inside tomorrow night.”</p>

<p>After that, Bai Wuchang didn’t wait for Han Sen to give a response. He simply left.</p>

<p>“What is this? I did not even give him an answer!” Han Sen wanted to call after Bai Wuchang, but as he stepped forward, he realized that the man was already gone. He had walked out of the lobby and left the space station.</p>

<p>“Who was that guy?” Han Sen looked at the card in his hand, assuming that it was a calling card. It was a black card with white text that simply read, “Bai Wuchang.” There was nothing else. It said nothing about Bai Wuchang’s position amongst the Extreme King.</p>

<p>Han Sen looked at the card in his hands. Bai Wei walked toward him, having finished her paperwork, but her eyes widened when she saw the card. “Where did you get that?”</p>

<p>“There was this guy called Bai Wuchang. He approached and gave me this card, and then he left,” Han Sen said while holding the card.</p>

<p>Bai Wei looked glum. She quickly asked, “Is he going to challenge you?”</p>

<p>“I think so,” Han Sen said with a nod.</p>

<p>“This is bad. How did he learn that you are here? And on top of that, he has the audacity to come and challenge you? He must be part of someone else’s plan,” Bai Wei said while nibbling her lips.</p>

<p>“Who is this Bai Wuchang? Is he famous?” Han Sen asked casually.</p>

<p>Bai Wei sighed and said, “He is my brother, and he is a prince. And he is the son of the empress. But unlike most princes, he has little in the way of authority. He only wants to level up. Even Father says he is one of our most talented princes. It is hard to predict how he will grow in the coming years.”</p>
