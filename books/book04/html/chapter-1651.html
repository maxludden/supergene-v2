    <p>
      Golden Growler went sniffing around the ground. It seemed to be tracking
      Blood Dog’s scent, and after a while, it began running forward.
    </p>
    <p>
      Broken stone buildings were everywhere, and their presence there made Han
      Sen frown. Golden Growler kept moving, and after a hundred miles, there
      was a large number of stone tablets scattered across a clearing.
    </p>
    <p>
      The stone tablets weren’t tidily placed, and many of them were even
      upside-down. But they were the only objects in that place that featured
      text.
    </p>
    <p>
      Han Sen made Golden Growler slow down. Due to the fact that Golden Growler
      had to follow a scent to stay on track, he reeled him in a little. If he
      continued, it’d be hard to find Blood Dog.
    </p>
    <p>
      Han Sen observed the tablets that featured ancient text; the sorts of
      languages Han Sen had learned long ago.
    </p>
    <p>Some parts of the tablets were missing, but many were still readable.</p>
    <p>
      “Imir defeated.” Han Sen thought that was strange. There was only the name
      of someone and the word defeated. The tablet didn’t look like a
      gravestone, but it didn’t look like a memorial plaque, either.
    </p>
    <p>
      Han Sen found it odd. He didn’t know who the supposed Imir character was.
    </p>
    <p>
      Han Sen checked out a few of the other tablets that were nearby. One of
      them said, “Veles defeated.” Aside from the change in name, all the others
      were the same, as well.
    </p>
    <p>
      Han Sen frowned and continued checking out the other tablets. They all
      seemed to contain a name, and the word defeated after. “Ji defeated,
      Gautama defeated, Marily defeated, Ginger defeated, Brahma defeated, Zeus
      defeated.”
    </p>
    <p>
      All of those names were on the tattered tablets, but there was nothing
      distinguishing about them. They did give him a cold feeling, though, and
      it made him feel as if he had stepped back in time. It felt like a certain
      sadness permeated the atmosphere of that place.
    </p>
    <p>
      Han Sen did not know who or what those names belonged to, and he did not
      know how those folks might have been defeated. Aside from their names,
      nothing else was left behind.
    </p>
    <p>
      After going through all the tablets, there was a bronze palace. It wasn’t
      as broken as the rest of the place, but it was still worn around the
      edges. There were the scrapes of a battle all across it, but it hadn’t
      been hewn or broken.
    </p>
    <p>
      The palace seemed to be in good condition, all things considered. It was
      in the middle of the plain, but one half seemed to have sunken into the
      earth. One wall was stuck in the soil.
    </p>
    <p>
      Golden Growler followed the scent, which led them straight to the bronze
      palace. He gave a quiet rumble to Han Sen, as if to indicate Blood Dog was
      inside.
    </p>
    <p>
      Han Sen checked the exterior of the bronze palace first. There was a big
      title above the door which said, “Hero Spirit Hall.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “For some reason, I have a bad feeling about this,” Dragon Lady said,
      observing the palace ahead.
    </p>
    <p>
      Han Sen nodded. He felt rather unsafe, as well. The Dongxuan Aura had
      difficulty scanning inside the palace, so he was unable to determine
      whether or not Blood Dog was on the inside.
    </p>
    <p>
      “The creature you summoned; where did it come from?” Han Sen asked Dragon
      Lady.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dragon Lady gave a wry smile. “I don’t know; my ingredients are random. I
      never know exactly what I will summon, and I don’t know where they come
      from.”
    </p>
    <p>
      After that, Dragon Lady looked towards the Hero Spirit Hall. “I think
      something is amiss. This place is too weird; it’d be best if we just left.
      We can try again another time.”
    </p>
    <p>
      Han Sen wished to say something, but before he spoke, he heard a sound.
      The tightly shut door suddenly started opening up. Han Sen and Dragon Lady
      stared at the gap of the opening gate. Golden Growler growled at the sight
      ahead.
    </p>
    <p>Tap!</p>
    <p>One hand suddenly appeared, pushing the door open.</p>
    <p>
      Han Sen looked at the hand that was holding the bronze door and noticed
      that it was rather skeletal in its appearance. Although it had kept the
      shape of a hand, the skin was thin and dried up against the bone. It was
      like birch bark, and it looked creepy. It looked dead.
    </p>
    <p>The hand grabbed the bronze door and slowly opened it.</p>
    <p>
      As the door opened toward them, Han Sen saw beyond it. He couldn’t see
      much, but a massive support pillar with visible, holding up the roof.
    </p>
    <p>
      The bronze door opened halfway, and when it did, Han Sen could see the
      master of the hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a being that was garbed with a black cloak. Aside from the hand,
      Han Sen couldn’t discern anything more about its body. The entire being
      was wrapped up by that same cloak. All Han Sen could truly notice was the
      rough outline of its body, which looked rather human.
    </p>
    <p>
      Han Sen used his Dongxuan Aura again, but he was unable to feel anything.
      The man in the black cloak looked dead; it was as if he had no lifeforce.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Since you are here, come on in.” The cloaked man opened the bronze gate
      fully now, and he stood at the entrance as he spoke.
    </p>
    <p>
      He looked toward Han Sen and the others before making a clanging, metallic
      sound. It was quite spooky.
    </p>
    <p>“What is your name?” Han Sen asked the cloaked man, very alert.</p>
    <p>
      “I am already dead, so what would be the purpose of having a name? If you
      require one, refer to me as the Guardian Spirit.” The creepiness of the
      cloaked man’s voice would strike so much fear into a person, their teeth
      would chatter.
    </p>
    <p>
      He lowered his head as he spoke, too. His face was fully concealed by the
      hood, like a spirit haunting a graveyard.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Guardian Spirit, who are you protecting?” When Han Sen heard the name, he
      didn’t feel any better. He wasn’t quite willing to step forward, either.
    </p>
    <p>“I am not guarding anyone now,” Guardian Spirit said coldly.</p>
    <p>
      Han Sen frowned and gave the man another look. Then, he pointed to the
      tablets and asked, “Are you guarding them?” Guardian Spirit suddenly
      laughed quite strangely and said, “Yes and no. I guard them, but I don’t
      guard them.”
    </p>
    <p>“What does that mean?” Han Sen asked with a frown.</p>
    <p>
      “You’ll know if you come and see.” Guardian Spirit was still laughing
      quite strangely.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Whatever you’re guarding, I can’t say I’m interested,” Han Sen said, and
      then patted his Golden Growler as an indication it was time to leave. It
      turned around and started to.
    </p>
    <p>
      The place was weird. Han Sen thought he was invincible in the Fourth God’s
      Sanctuary, but there were still many strange and creepy things occupying
      that realm. And so, Han Sen did not think he could kill everything. After
      he saw Stay Up Late, he knew he was not as immortal as he fancied himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Even though you are here, you do not want to take a look?” Guardian
      Spirit asked quietly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Han Sen ignored him and hurried Golden Growler away. But he walked so slow
      now, like some phantom force of power was them back. Golden Growler began
      to slide backward. He slid all the way back until they were pulled right
      inside the bronze palace.
