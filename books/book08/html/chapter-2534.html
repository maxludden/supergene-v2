<h2>Gold General Appears</h2>
<h3>Chapter 2534</h3>

<p>The Sea Sky Eye seemed to notice that its blue lights were
unable to kill the knights, but it still lashed out angrily. It
imbued its blue light with even greater strength. When the
substance chains coming from the Sea Sky Eye seemed to reach their
maximum power, the creature’s blindingly bright body seemed to
suddenly darken. A giant blue vortex formed around the creature and
began sucking everything else toward it.</p>
<p>The King class elites blasted their power at the blue vortex in
an attempt to disrupt its pull, but their efforts were fruitless.
Not even the half-deifieds could resist the attractive force of the
vortex. Under the power of that scary suction, they went flying
forward.</p>
<p>As a few of the knights got sucked into the blue vortex, Bai Wan
Jie suddenly shouted, “Nightmare, now!”</p>
<p>The leader of the knights was drawing near the vortex. Hearing
Bai Wan Jie’s shout, he pulled out an item. Han Sen adjusted his
scope to get a better view. The Extreme King leader was holding an
object that looked like an old statue. The statue seemed familiar
to Han Sen. After a second, he placed it.</p>
<p>“An Ancient God Statue?” Han Sen was shocked.</p>
<p>The statue blazed with light the moment that the man pulled it
out. The light created a mysterious shadow that shielded Nightmare
Knight. It also increased Nightmare Knight’s power, giving him
deified strength in an instant. A gold substance chain appeared
around his body.</p>
<p>This Ancient God Statue was different from the one that Han Sen
had seen before. This one was giving its user metal powers.</p>
<p>Nightmare Knight didn’t hesitate. Once he had received the metal
powers from the Ancient God Statue, he pulled out a metallic spear.
Han Sen could see that the spear was laden with mysterious symbols.
As the deified metal power flowed into Nightmare Knight, the
symbols across the spear became very bright. Metal substance chains
swirled around the spear, transforming the spear into an old,
mysterious metal pillar.</p>
<p>Nightmare Knight roared and shoved the mysterious metal pillar
into the blue vortex.</p>
<p>“An Ancient God Statue and a deified treasure? The Extreme King
are wealthy indeed!” Han Sen didn’t blink. He just stared at Sea
Sky Eye and the mysterious metal pillar. He wanted to see what
would happen next.</p>
<p>That mysterious metal pillar looked like the weapon of some
ancient sea deity as it was thrust into the blue vortex. When the
pillar touched the vortex, the swirling blue power began to slow.
The metal pillar was driven deeper and deeper into the vortex, and
the blue power began to shine strangely. It was like a series of
thunderbolts were striking the pillar. The creature’s attacks
failed to break the pillar, though. Cracks began to spread through
space around the blue vortex, and every time the pillar sank
another inch into the vortex, one of the Sea Sky Eye’s substance
chains fell apart.</p>
<p>The Sea Sky Eye seemed to have realized that something wasn’t
quite right. It wanted to retreat, but it was too late for that.
The mysterious metal pillar has suppressed the vortex and pinned
the creature in place. As the seconds ticked by, the pillar pierced
relentlessly through the creature’s defenses.</p>
<p>Han Sen could see that the Sea Sky Eye wasn’t going to last.
Since the time had arrived, he quickly summoned the Gold Armor
General beast soul. With his new beast soul cloaking his form, he
headed straight for the Sea Sky Eye.</p>
<p>Han Sen hadn’t been flying for long when something changed
within the Sea Sky Eye again. The blue vortex that had spun like
water became ice. It froze the metal pillar that was half-way
inside it.</p>
<p>From afar, it looked like a long metal pencil sticking out of a
giant blue eyeball. It was an extremely disturbing sight.</p>
<p>“All of you! Deploy your power to push the pillar inside. We
have to use it to suppress the Sea Sky Eye!” Bai Wan Jie’s face had
become grim as he shouted the new command.</p>
<p>The royal knights reacted quickly. They hurled all of their
scary powers at the end of the metal pillar, striking it like they
were hammering in a nail. With each new explosion of power, they
pushed the metal pillar deeper into the blue eyeball.</p>
<p>As the metal pillar went in, the cracks across the blue eyeball
widened and spread. The eyeball was growing too weak. It was going
to shatter.</p>
<p>Bai Wan Jie’s eyes brightened as he watched the Sea Sky Eye’s
strength fail. He knew that success was within arm’s reach.</p>
<p>They were sacrificing a great deal for this victory. It had
taken the combined powers of an Ancient God Statue, a Sky God
Pillar, and an Emperor Staff. The Sky God Pillar and Emperor Staff
could be used again, but the Ancient God Statue was a one-time use
item.</p>
<p>And because he used the Emperor Staff, he had burned through a
lot of the strength in his king body. He had used his body’s power
to activate the Emperor Staff, and using it for so long had cost
him a lot of energy. He would be another year or two before he
recovered his strength.</p>
<p>eCOV</p>
<p>But as long as he could get the Sea Sky Eye’s xenogeneic gene,
it would all be worth it.</p>
<p>As Bai Wan Jie’s excitement grew, a gold light flashed by him. A
gold form appeared behind the Sky God Pillar, drawing his
attention.</p>
<p>“Gold Armor General! Why is a Gold Armor General here?” Bai Wan
Jie’s brain had no idea what to do with what he was seeing.</p>
<p>All the royal knights stared in shock, as well. They couldn’t
imagine why there was a Gold Armor General before them, so they had
no idea how to react.</p>
<p>Finishing off the Sea Sky Eye was taking all their power, and
now a Gold Armor General had appeared out of nowhere. They had no
clue what to do.Boom!</p>
<p>Before they could muster a reaction, Han Sen used the Gold Armor
General to slam the Sky God Pillar’s base. A glowing gold substance
chain hurtled into the Sky God Pillar, shoving the pillar all the
way into the Sea Sky Eye. A hole appeared in the moon-sized Sea Sky
Eye.</p>
<p>“Core Deified Xenogeneic hunted: Sea Sky Core Eye. Xenogeneic
gene found.”</p>
<p>As this announcement played inside Han Sen’s head, he felt
disappointed that he hadn’t received a beast soul.</p>
<p>Han Sen didn’t stop, though. He drove the gold general into the
big hole that the Sky God Pillar had opened up. As he flew, he saw
a fist-sized blue eyeball. He grabbed it in his hand as he went
through the body of the Sea Sky Eye. When the gold general emerged
from the other side of the Sea Sky Eye, the creature’s giant corpse
suddenly collapsed. It shattered, spraying out like chips on blue
ice. The explosion washed over the system like a quick, passing
blizzard.</p>
<p>Han Sen returned to the Sky God Pillar. As its power faded, it
returned to its shape as a spear. The gold general grabbed it, then
turned and raced off at full speed.</p>
<p>Bai Wan Jie and all the royal knights in the area had seen the
bloody cape flying behind the figure. And they had seen the golden
pipes spewing fire. The place now looked quiet and dead.</p>
<p>“Gold Armor General stole the Sky God Pillar and the Sea Sky
Eye’s core gene,” Bai Wan Jie seethed. When the shock wore off, he
was so angry that he felt like he was about to vomit. He wanted to
chase after the Gold Armor General, but it was too late to do so.
The Gold Armor General was barely visible at this point; it was
little more than a golden dot in the distance.</p>
