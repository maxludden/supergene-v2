<h2>Walking Out of the Hall</h2>
<h3>Chapter 1854</h3>

<p>Xie Qing King stopped just short of the entrance and spoke aloud
to Han Sen. “Do you really have a way? If you don’t, I’ll pull you
out of there!”</p>
<p>“Don’t worry. I have a way,” Han Sen said calmly.</p>
<p>“Han Sen, give him your sacrifice and make the wish! Do you want
to die?” Captain Wood said, with a frown.</p>
<p>“He is your god, Rebate. He is not the god of the crystallizers.
Who said I absolutely must make a wish with him?” Han Sen mocked
the scenario.</p>
<p>“It looks like you really don’t want to live.” Captain Wood
looked rather gloomy.</p>
<p>It didn’t matter to him if Han Sen wanted to live or die, but he
was on Planet Eclipse. If Han Sen randomly died there, under his
supervision, he couldn’t rightly explain to Queen what had
transpired.</p>
<p>“Skygod, I am not making a wish. And I will not hand over the
feather. Even if you kill me or torture me, you won’t obtain it.
So, come on! Give me what you’ve got,” Han Sen said, then continued
walking toward the door.</p>
<p>Sun Skygod did not say a word. Han Sen’s body was growing old
very quickly, though. His face had wrinkled, and his hair had gone
white.</p>
<p>“Even if you do not want to use the Raven feather to save your
people, aren’t you interested in something for yourself? How about
immortality? If you make a wish, you can live forever! Or you can
become the king of some land, if you so choose. I can grant you
anything you want, right here, right now.” Sun Skygod finally broke
his silence.</p>
<p>Han Sen did not respond. He continued walking away. He couldn’t
leave, so he just kept on going.</p>
<p>“Has someone you love died? If you make a wish, I can bring them
back for you.” Sun Skygod offered more, seeing Han Sen’s continued
disinterest.</p>
<p>Han Sen didn’t say anything to him, though. He just kept on
going, as if he hadn’t heard a thing.</p>
<p>“If you want to become Narrow Moon’s absolute master, you only
have to ask that of me.” Sun Skygod’s offerings were becoming
grander as time went on. If this continued, it wouldn’t be long
before Han Sen found himself in the seat of the creator.</p>
<p>Han Sen remained unfazed and uncaring. He kept on walking. He
walked in the direction of the door that could never be
reached.</p>
<p>Not long after, Han Sen’s hair had all turned white. His face
was covered in wrinkles. He was like a dying old man. He was really
old at this point.</p>
<p>Little Silver, who had been sitting on Han Sen’s shoulder the
whole time, was old, too. His silver hair had turned white, and it
looked as if he was going to die of old age.</p>
<p>“What? Are you not going to help him?” a Marquise mocked.</p>
<p>Xie Qing King said coldly, “He said he has a way out of
there.”</p>
<p>The Marquise lifted his top lip, thinking Xie Qing King was
merely too scared to go to Han Sen’s aid. The others thought the
same, as well. They could see him standing on the precipice, only
watching Han Sen and refusing to step inside.</p>
<p>Suddenly, the purple-bronze door shut. And then, you could not
see what was beyond there. This also meant Han Sen was now hidden
from sight.</p>
<p>“It looks like Skygod is angry. Han Sen is most likely dead now.
We should go, Master.” Captain Wood was speaking to Black
Steel.</p>
<p>Black Steel frowned and looked at the solemn door that had
closed. He said, “Okay, let’s leave.”</p>
<p>“What are you two doing there? Why are you not leaving?” a
Marquise asked Xie Qing King and Gu Qingcheng.</p>
<p>“We are waiting for Han Sen,” Xie Qing King coldly said.</p>
<p>“Earlier, you two were afraid to step inside. Stop pretending
about this nonsense.” The Marquise lifted his lip.</p>
<p>“Let them stay,” Black Steel said. Then, he signaled for the
rest of the team to depart. Then, he murmured to Xie Qing King,
“Tell Han Sen that I’m sorry. I will leave much of the lotus in the
base.”</p>
<p>“Okay.” Xie Qing King affirmed he would.</p>
<p>When Captain Wood took the others to the place’s exit, Xie Qing
King spoke again. He said, “Is Han Sen really going to be
fine?”</p>
<p>“I thought you were confident he would be.” Gu Qingcheng looked
at the door before them and spoke carelessly.</p>
<p>“I am, but that Skygod is a dodgy fellow. I am afraid Han Sen
will walk out as an old man.” Xie Qing King slumped his
shoulders.</p>
<p>Gu Qingcheng understood what he was getting at, but she did not
respond to him.</p>
<p>A lot of time passed, and after an hour, the purple-bronze door
opened. Han Sen came out alongside Little Silver.</p>
<p>Han Sen had not become an old man, and he was as young as he had
been when he first entered the hall. He had not been injured,
either.</p>
<p>Little Silver was fine, too. And he had his old silver fur that
was radiant and shiny.</p>
<p>“Did you make a wish?” Gu Qingcheng spoke to Han Sen, looking
real dim.</p>
<p>Han Sen shook his head and pulled out a box. He smiled and said,
“The item Skygod wanted is still in here. Even if I make a wish, he
won’t listen.”</p>
<p>“Why would he let you go unharmed, if you didn’t make one?” Xie
Qing King asked with much curiosity.</p>
<p>“I was fine the whole time. Him speeding up time was merely an
illusion.” Han Sen smiled.</p>
<p>“It was an illusion? That means he wasn’t real, and all his
power was merely for show?” Xie Qing King said.</p>
<p>“He doesn’t have all the powers he pretended to have, but at
least his space powers were legit. Even though he is not really
all-powerful, he is still at a deified level. Even if we have to
fight him eventually, we cannot deal with him now.” Han Sen shook
his head.</p>
<p>“Why did he not kill you and just take the feather?” Xie Qing
King could not believe that things had worked out this way.</p>
<p>Han Sen did not answer Xie Qing King, though. He just looked at
Gu Qingcheng and asked, “That Sun Skygod, was he the same god as
the one you met?”</p>
<p>Gu Qingcheng shook her head. “I don’t think so. This one gave me
a completely different feeling to the one I previously met. That
being said, there appears to be a thread connecting them somehow.
Maybe. I can’t quite put my finger on it.”</p>
<p>“Maybe they are both of the same kind? They must both have a
limitation of some sort. They cannot just kill people.” Han Sen did
not continue with that train of questions, though. He just looked
around and asked, “Captain Wood and the others have left?”</p>
<p>“As soon as the door shut, they took their leave. Black Steel
told us he would leave some of the lotus roots for us at the base,”
Xie Qing King answered.</p>
<p>“I am afraid they might not even be able to leave the palace. As
far as I know, those who make wishes don’t meet a fond fate. Let’s
go. I hope we can catch up with them.” Han Sen took off power
walking.</p>
<p>“I don’t understand! How did you know all that was an illusion?”
Gu Qingcheng asked, matching Han Sen’s speed. She had no idea it
was all a trick.</p>
<p>Han Sen did not answer. He patted his shoulder and Little
Invisible revealed itself. Han Sen smiled. “If that power was real,
he should have aged, too.”</p>
