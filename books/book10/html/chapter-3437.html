        <p>Han Sen looked at Crape Myrtle and asked, “How was that
            punch?”</p>
        <p>Crape Myrtle’s body calmed down. He then answered, “Not
            bad.”</p>
        <p>He said it very simply as if nothing had happened. In his heart,
            he was more than shocked. Han Sen’s punch had been one of pure body
            power. It shook his body. He could not imagine how that could have
            happened. Crape Myrtle was like a different kind of God Spirit.
            After all, he was known as Geno Hall Leader. To be direct, the geno
            hall was a Super God Spirit temple, and Crape Myrtle was the main
            god of it. The other 12 Annihilation-class God Spirit and other
            lower-class God Spirit were its sub-gods.</p>
        <p>All of the god temple powers gave Crape Myrtle a God Spirit
            buff. The more powerful the God Spirit was, the more buffs Crape
            Myrtle could get.</p>
        <p>Plus, Crape Myrtle had half of his foot in the Universe class.
            His god body’s strength was above Qin Xiu. Unless there was a
            Universe-class power, no one should have been able to move his god
            body.</p>
        <p>But Han Sen’s power made his god body shake. It made Crape
            Myrtle’s body want to explode. His brain was still buzzing after
            that mighty punch.</p>
        <p>Although this was because Crape Myrtle was a very proud person,
            it was already enough to make Crape Myrtle very shocked.</p>
        <p>Crape Myrtle thought, “His body is so scary. His pure body power
            is already so strong. If he can truly grasp and control his body
            one day, even if Qin Xiu takes that step, he might not be an
            adequate rival to him.”</p>
        <p>“Are you okay?” Han Sen saw Crape Myrtle was not speaking or
            doing anything in return. He thought the punch might have hurt him
            pretty badly.</p>
        <p>Under the suppression of Crape Myrtle’s 28 starlights, Han Sen
            had still managed to activate his body power. This time, the power
            was not coming from the outside. It was coming from somewhere
            within. It came from his will. He had finally been able to trigger
            his body power.</p>
        <p>Han Sen felt that power he had activated was just a small part
            of it. If he wanted to activate the whole power in his body and use
            it, he could not imagine the sort of trick that would be necessary
            to achieve such a feat.</p>
        <p>“How could I have a problem? Your power is far from being
            sufficient enough to damage me.” Crape Myrtle raised his head and
            behaved as if nothing happened.</p>
        <p>“Really? In that case, that is great. Try and withstand a few
            more of my punches.” Han Sen wanted to try his method a few more
            times and see if he could dredge up even more power from deep
            within his body.</p>
        <p>Crape Myrtle’s heart was now in shock, but his face did not
            change to display it. He thought, “If I take a few more of your
            punches, my god body will start to suffer.”</p>
        <p>Crape Myrtle went there because he wanted to suppress Han Sen so
            he could learn to control his body. He quickly realized that his
            power was not even enough to suppress Han Sen. He was unable to
            activate his power.</p>
        <p>Although Han Sen had been able to trigger some amount of power,
            the power he used was pure body power. He knew that it was the most
            basic power there was. He was far from being able to trigger the
            real, meaty stuff.</p>
        <p>“Human Alpha created the Story of Genes, but Human Alpha did not
            practice it. Han Sen, however, did. If Human Alpha knew his Story
            of Genes could lend a hand in creating such a scary body, I wonder
            if he would regret treading the path he ultimately settled on.”
            Crape Myrtle thought about this to himself, as he came to a
            decision.</p>
        <p>Crape Myrtle raised his head, looked at Han Sen, and said, “Han
            Sen, although your body is very strong, if this was back then and
            you could really control your body, I do not think I would be able
            to defeat you. Today, you will be given no chance of improving.”
            “What is that supposed to mean?” Han Sen was shocked by the
            remarks.</p>
        <p>He thought Crape Myrtle was not there for fighting. Upon hearing
            Crape Myrtle’s tone of voice, it sounded as if he wanted to stop
            him from leveling up to reach the last fight.</p>
        <p>“Was I mistaken? Is this not Geno Hall Leader?” Han Sen wondered
            to himself.</p>
        <p>Han Sen did not know Crape Myrtle did not plan on winning. After
            seeing Han Sen’s body, he decided to kick Han Sen out. He did not
            want him to fight Human King.</p>
        <p>If Han Sen encountered Human King now, Han Sen was sure to lose.
            Han Sen needed more time. Even if Human King was finally able to
            walk the final step, Han Sen would then have a chance of winning
            for sure. Crape Myrtle had to decide. He wanted to now kick Han Sen
            out of the fights so he could grow up a bit more.</p>
        <p>Crape Myrtle looked at Han Sen and spoke coldly to him. “What I
            am saying is that today I will win. In grief and sadness, you will
            have to abandon the fight.”</p>
        <p>“Maybe not.” Han Sen had just found a way to use his body. He
            was no longer defenseless.</p>
        <p>Crape Myrtle weirdly laughed. “No one can reject something I
            want to come to pass.”</p>
        <p>Before Han Sen could speak, Crape Myrtle put his hands together
            and opened them. When his hands opened, there was a god light. The
            god light was too strong. It shone across the whole 33 skies’
            battlegrounds. It was like a giant sun. All the creatures that were
            watching the fight felt their eyes hurt. They dared not keep their
            eyes on it. They closed their eyes. Even the elites that could
            withstand the shiny god lights could only see shiny god lights.
            They could not see what was transpiring in the arena.</p>
        <p>Han Sen’s eyes could see through the shiny god light, and he
            could observe Crape Myrtle’s movements inside the light.</p>
        <p>When Crape Myrtle opened his hands, there was a space rift
            between his hands. Within that space rift, an old door
            appeared.</p>
        <p>“Isn’t that the geno hall door?” Upon seeing the door appear,
            Han Sen was given a fright.</p>
        <p>If Crape Myrtle was able to summon the geno hall door, it had to
            mean he was the guy inside the geno hall. When Crape Myrtle opened
            his hands completely, the geno hall door was revealed in its
            entirety.</p>
        <p>“Open!” Crape Myrtle shouted. The old and mysterious door
            opened. Suddenly, a very bright god light started to seep through
            the door.</p>
        <p>This was the light of 10,000 race lanterns, but Han Sen still
            did not understand why the geno hall only had the race lanterns of
            the geno universe. There were no race lanterns dedicated to the
            universe of kingdoms.</p>
        <p>Also, the universe of kingdoms was the home for any god temples.
            No god temples existed in the geno universe.</p>
        <p>Crape Myrtle looked at Han Sen and said, “Han Sen, go. You will
            find what you need inside here.”</p>
        <p>Han Sen knew for sure that this was geno hall’s Mister God. He
            was confused, so he asked, “Big Brother, what is that supposed to
            mean? I am going to fight Qin Xiu! If you send me away, you will
            have to fight Qin Xiu by yourself.”</p>
        <p>“There is no more Qin Xiu,” Crape Myrtle said.</p>
        <p>“What do you mean?” Han Sen was shocked. He did not know what
            had been going on inside the other arenas. He did not know Qin Xiu
            had been consumed by Human King.</p>
