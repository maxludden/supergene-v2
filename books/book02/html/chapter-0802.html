    <p>
      Han Sen suddenly stopped. He turned around to look at the spirit, which
      looked like a true monarch, and noticed his muscles begin to tighten.
    </p>

    <p>
      It was not at as if he didn&#8217;t want to go any further, he was just
      taken aback. The spirit had locked on an attack, and if he moved an inch
      further, he&#8217;d be cut down.
    </p>

    <p>
      But if he just stood there, the spirit&#8217;s energy would grow until she
      unleashed an attack of devastating power. At that point, there&#8217;d be
      no way for Han Sen to get out of its way.
    </p>

    <p>
      Although Han Sen&#8217;s abilities of prediction were at their peak, if
      the spirit unleashed an attack he could not react to in any way, then the
      predictions were pointless.
    </p>

    <p>
      The spirit&#8217;s energy kept rising, and it gave him a horrid feeling.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Damn it!&#8221; Cold sweat formed on Han Sen&#8217;s forehead.
      Seeing the spirit building her power, while he was unable to do anything
      about it, was scary.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;I&#8217;ll have to risk it.&#8221; Han Sen could not think of
      another way out of this predicament. He gathered his power for a
      Sonic-Thunder Punch and readied himself to take the hit.
    </p>

    <p>
      With a frightening attack like the one the spirit prepared to unleash, Han
      Sen didn&#8217;t think she&#8217;d recover to perform one like it again;
      assuming he could withstand the collision. This was his chance.
    </p>

    <p>
      If he failed, however, at the very most he would lose his armor,
      gargoyle-glyph, and Devil Unicorn. He had maximized his defense, and with
      all those beast souls shielding him, the spirit&#8217;s attack
      couldn&#8217;t be a one-hit kill, at least.
    </p>

    <p>Boom!</p>

    <p>
      After Han Sen&#8217;s fist had collected all the power it needed, he
      watched the black flame-wreathed, witch-like spirit suddenly make her
      move.
    </p>

    <p>
      In the distance between the two of them, space collapsed and became
      disrupted. Then, the spirit disappeared. It was as if she had fallen into
      that collapsed dimension, zapped out of existence.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen&#8217;s pupils shrank, unable to catch the spirit&#8217;s movement
      pattern. His heart was shocked, as all his senses could do was fire an
      alarm telling him of an imminent threat—one that was big and scary.
    </p>

    <p>Boom!</p>

    <p>
      Han Sen couldn&#8217;t spare much time, so he threw his fist. The silver
      lightning in his fist split the atmosphere, as lightning bolts flickered
      in all directions. Lightning and thunder rolled with a deafening volume,
      enough to pop eardrums and rattle the brain.
    </p>

    <p>
      In the next second, the spirit suddenly appeared in front of Han Sen. Her
      cold, monarch-like face was near enough to touch nose-to-nose. Her jade
      white fist was driven into his belly.
    </p>

    <p>Boom!</p>

    <p>
      Han Sen wanted to dodge it, but doing so was impossible. When the spirit
      punched his belly, his armor shattered as broken plates and splintered
      metal rained down. Han Sen himself was cast into the air once more, and
      his flight was stopped by the sudden collision with a stone pillar.
    </p>

    <p>
      Beneath the force of that wretched attack, the back of his armor was
      cracked. The gargoyle glyph had been completely broken, and the beast soul
      disintegrated into dust.
    </p>

    <p>
      The Devil Unicorn did little to hinder physical attacks. It was still
      there with him, but it didn&#8217;t do much.
    </p>

    <p>
      Fortunately, the armor was not entirely broken. But it was in disarray and
      was near-enough done for. Han Sen spit out some blood and returned the
      Devil-Ant King armor.
    </p>

    <p>
      If it was to sustain another blow, the Devil-Ant King armor would surely
      brake. He only had one super armor, so he couldn&#8217;t risk losing the
      only one he had.
    </p>

    <p>
      Without the protection of super armor, however, fighting would be much
      more difficult and risky for Han Sen. His fitness was rather high, but it
      still wasn&#8217;t high enough to face off against super creatures.
    </p>

    <p>
      Seeing how things were, Han Sen made preparations to leave. He
      acknowledged the direness of the situation and his inability to fight.
      With the way things had been going, death would surely be the only outcome
      to this entire affair.
    </p>

    <p>
      The holy light flowed out from his body to heal his wounds. After that, he
      quickly ran out the gates of the shelter.
    </p>

    <p>
      Just as Han Sen expected, though, the spirit could not teleport in pursuit
      of him after her last attack. But unlike Han Sen, her condition
      wasn&#8217;t one of utter exhaustion. She could still deal more damage
      than he could.
    </p>

    <p>
      After Han Sen used his Sonic-Thunder Punch, his body became weak. He
      couldn&#8217;t dwell on it, so he cast Aero with his knackered body and
      took off into the skies in an escape from the shelter and its occupying
      spirit.
    </p>

    <p>
      He didn&#8217;t dare use his wings. If he used the berserk sacred-blood
      wings, then he&#8217;d be much slower. Aero used the power of a
      person&#8217;s body to fly as fast as they could.
    </p>

    <p>
      But the spirit leapt one hundred meters into the sky, and appeared
      directly in front of Han Sen. He veered away, circling the sky like a
      strange bird. He dodged her next attack, but it was only now that he
      realized the spirit&#8217;s black flames worked as wings and gave it the
      ability of flight.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;I really have put my life on the line coming here.&#8221; Han Sen
      gritted his teeth and prepared to run for his life, instead. But then, he
      suddenly heard a katcha noise.
    </p>

    <p>
      The noise came from inside his pack, and at that moment, Han Sen became
      exuberantly happy. He thought to himself, &#8220;Is Little Silver going to
      finish evolving?&#8221;
    </p>

    <p>
      But Han Sen did not have the time to take a look just yet. He continued to
      fly as fast as he could, evading the spirit&#8217;s attacks like a
      dogfight.
    </p>

    <p>
      But after that one sound, there were no further noises. His heart sank
      once more, and so he returned his focus to fleeing.
    </p>

    <p>
      He also called back to the fairy, telling her, &#8220;Run, fairy!&#8221;
    </p>

    <p>
      After Han Sen said that, he took to his attempt of flight. Just as he was
      about to escape from the shelter, his heart jumped again.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Damn it, it&#8217;s happening again!&#8221; He looked back and saw
      the spirit gathering her power once more, undoubtedly seeking to unleash
      the same attack she had previously.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen gritted his teeth and prepared to summon the little angel back, so
      she could deflect the attack for him. If he sustained the same attack
      again, he&#8217;d be grievously injured.
    </p>

    <p>
      But suddenly, another katcha sounded from inside his pack. A familiar
      energy came out of it, and it appeared as if something was indeed hatching
      inside.
    </p>

    <p>Boom!</p>

    <p>
      In Han Sen&#8217;s moment of pause, the spirit already broke the
      atmosphere with her follow-up attack. Han Sen lost track of her, and he
      knew now that it was too late to summon the little angel back.
    </p>

    <p>
      The spirit appeared in front of Han Sen, with a fist determined to drive
      into his waist once more. With such incredible speed, and at such a close
      distance, Han Sen could not do anything to avoid it.
    </p>

    <p>
      But within that second, Han Sen saw the spirit&#8217;s face change. Her
      black pupils reduced in size and her cold face displayed a glimmer of
      emotion: shock.
    </p>

    <p>Boom!</p>

    <p>
      A silver lightning bolt appeared from Han Sen&#8217;s waist. Like bright
      moonlight, it struck her incoming fist.
