    <p>
      Han Sen quickly walked to the shelter’s hall. There, he saw a creature
      floating inside.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Little Fairy? You’re a demigod now?” Han Sen looked at the small,
      fairy-like lady with surprise.
    </p>
    <p>
      “What? Only you are allowed to be a demigod, and I’m not?” Little Fairy
      lifted her lips. It seemed as if she didn’t like what he had just said.
    </p>
    <p>“No, I just didn’t expect you to ascend so quickly.” Han Sen smiled.</p>
    <p>
      Han Sen had first encountered Little Fairy in the Second God’s Sanctuary,
      not the Third God’s Sanctuary. For a creature, leveling up was a much more
      arduous process than it was for a human. Han Sen was genuinely surprised
      she had become a demigod already.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Pfft! I became a demigod before you did.” Little Fairy looked at him with
      disdain.
    </p>
    <p>
      Han Sen then realized why he hadn’t seen Little Fairy in the Third God’s
      Sanctuary; it was because she had already become a demigod.
    </p>
    <p>
      “How did you find out where I’ve been staying?” Han Sen asked Little
      Fairy. The Fourth God’s Sanctuary was massive, after all.
    </p>
    <p>
      “That does not matter, but I found you because I know something that will
      interest you.” Little Fairy smiled.
    </p>
    <p>
      “What good deeds can you do for me? Forgive my dubiousness,” Han Sen said.
      Little Fairy was a heartless little creature, and she never even looked
      back when she ascended to the Third God’s Sanctuary. She just followed the
      other person through. Han Sen didn’t trust her, and he couldn’t imagine
      her going out of her way to do something nice for him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Little Fairy looked visibly annoyed, and she said, “You are a really
      unappreciative person. I came all this way to take you to God’s Ruin. I
      thought you’d benefit from the venture, but never mind then. I’m going
      now.”
    </p>
    <p>
      Little Fairy said she was going, but her wings flapped at a snail’s pace.
      She wasn’t leaving anywhere.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Drop the act and just tell me what this is all about,” Han Sen said.
      Little Fairy hadn’t changed a bit, and her personality was the same as
      always. The only difference was that she was now smarter and stronger.
    </p>
    <p>
      Little Fairy didn’t feel awkward, and she explained why she was there.
    </p>
    <p>
      She had been living well for herself. When she ascended to the Third God’s
      Sanctuary, a powerful spirit had taken her. After a few years, it had
      helped her open ten gene locks, and when the spirit ascended to the Fourth
      God’s Sanctuary, it brought her along.
    </p>
    <p>
      Little Fairy was living a nice life. She wasn’t doing as well as she had
      in the Third God’s Sanctuary, but she had managed to reach gemstone class.
      She was very talented and powerful, and the spirit continued to help her.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a good thing that Little Fairy had come looking for Han Sen. She
      wanted Han Sen to go to God’s Ruin with her.
    </p>
    <p>
      God’s Ruin was a sacred place in the Fourth God’s Sanctuary. The item that
      was said to lie inside possessed a power that distorted dimensions. This
      was what made it special.
    </p>
    <p>
      The item had other powers as well, and it appeared in a number of
      different locations.
    </p>
    <p>
      Little Fairy was journeying to a ruin that was covered in ice. The place’s
      power was based on ice, just like Little Fairy herself. So, Little Fairy
      fancied testing her luck to see if she could get the item.
    </p>
    <p>
      If she didn’t get it, there was still plenty of stuff for them to get
      there. She wasn’t lying to Han Sen.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Many would enjoy visiting such a place. Won’t it be suicide for us to go
      with the power we have?” Han Sen asked quietly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Little Fairy smiled and said, “If super class elites were allowed, I
      wouldn’t have come looking for you. It only lets gemstones and those below
      inside.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Well, in that case, I guess there’s no harm in trying,” Han Sen said.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Don’t hesitate. Let’s go! The heirs of many elites will be headed there,
      those from a variety of super shelters,” Little Fairy said.
    </p>
    <p>
      Han Sen wanted to go, but he didn’t know if he could still enter the ruin
      if he had a God geno core. A God geno core was a super geno core. If entry
      was restricted to gemstone geno cores only, he might not be allowed
      inside.
    </p>
    <p>
      Han Sen, after thinking things over, decided to give it a shot,
      regardless. A God geno core was different from a self geno core, so maybe
      there was a chance he’d be allowed inside.
    </p>
    <p>
      Even if he couldn’t, he might learn something by going along with the
      venture for the time being.
    </p>
    <p>“Are there any people from Outer Sky or Sacred going?” Han Sen asked.</p>
    <p>
      “Yeah. Yu Miao from Outer Sky is going, and so is Goddess from Sacred,”
      Little Fairy said, after thinking.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Okay. I’ll follow you.” When Han Sen heard those two were going, he
      definitely wanted in.
    </p>
    <p>
      Han Sen wasn’t on pleasant terms with either of those women, but it would
      be ridiculous for Han Sen to go to their respective shelters to try to
      kill them. Even if Han Sen didn’t earn any relics or items, killing them
      would make this trip worth it.
    </p>
    <p>
      That was especially true for Goddess and her cheap dog. He wanted nothing
      more than to slice them both up. But Han Sen still worried about whether
      or not he’d be able to go in. If he couldn’t, there was nothing he could
      do.
    </p>
    <p>
      Han Sen wasn’t afraid of the potential fallout from killing them both,
      though. Shadow Shelter now had Gu Qingcheng and Red Pony for back-up. They
      were powerful.
    </p>
    <p>
      Gu Qingcheng was a powerful person from Elysium Shelter, and since she
      feared Red Pony, it couldn’t possibly be any weaker. Even if Outer Sky and
      Sacred came after Shadow Shelter, it was difficult to tell which of the
      two would win.
    </p>
    <p>
      And Outer Sky knew Gu Qingcheng had taken over Shadow Shelter, too. They
      hadn’t dared to send anyone there, and they didn’t know Han Sen had
      returned to control it now.
    </p>
    <p>
      Han Sen packed a few things. He wasn’t going to bring anyone, but Bao’er,
      Little Silver, and Starsea Beast caught wind of his venture and wanted to
      come along.
    </p>
    <p>
      When Little Fairy saw Little Silver and Starsea Beast, her eyes beamed
      brightly. She convinced Han Sen to bring them along for additional
      firepower.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cheap Sheep and Green Cow were loyal, and they wanted to go, too. But
      Little Fairy turned them down in case they died.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Little Silver and Starsea Beast have gemstone geno cores, so we can bring
      them. They aren’t weaker than any super creature’s heir. If I can go, they
      shouldn’t have to worry about anything.” Han Sen thought about it and
      decided to let them come.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Han Sen thought that if he was unable to go inside, he wouldn’t risk
      them going inside alone. It’d be too dangerous.
    </p>
    <p>
      Plus, Han Sen was still worried about Little Fairy. There was always the
      possibility that she was trying to trick them.
