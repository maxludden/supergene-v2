<p>Ordinary people could not withstand the music, and the chiming
of the bell was far more grueling.</p>
<p>Even Seven Spirit himself, who had practiced the Buddha geno art
and acquired the four-faced, eight-armed Buddha form, was having a
hard time under the bell’s oppression. He was losing control of his
body.</p>
<p>Han Sen was a Viscount, and yet he had escaped the music. Seven
Spirit could barely believe it.</p>
<p>The ordinary heavenly music and the bell were not physical
attacks; they were more like a torturing of the mind. But this was
a department where Han Sen excelled. His will was as strong as a
deified elite’s, so he wasn’t affected by the Buddha Heaven’s
music.</p>
<p>He pretended to be affected so he could lure Seven Spirit
forward and ensure that the Buddha wouldn’t give up chasing
him.</p>
<p>Now, Seven Spirit had fallen under the bell’s influence. And
that meant it was time for Han Sen to strike back.</p>
<p>Han Sen’s rabbit shoes were moving in a blur, flinging him
forward like a shadow. The Ghost Teeth Knife gave off a purple
knifelight as it came swinging at Seven Spirit.</p>
<p>Seven Spirit wished to flee, but as soon as he started to do so,
his arm and legs flailed in a dance. His legs weren’t following his
commands, and he couldn’t move the way he wanted to.</p>
<p>Pang!</p>
<p>The knifelight was broken by Seven Spirit’s hands. The
four-faced, eight-armed Buddha body was quite scary.</p>
<p>Han Sen’s face did not change. He kept swinging the Ghost Teeth
Knife and using Teeth Knife knife skills. His body continued to
flash around Seven Spirit.</p>
<p>Seven Spirit stumbled back, using his eight arms to fight
against Han Sen. But at various times, some parts of his body would
lose all control. He began to make mistakes he wouldn’t have,
otherwise.</p>
<p>A moment was all that it took for him to make a big mistake.
Even though Han Sen’s body was inferior to Seven Spirit’s, it was
through all those mistakes that Han Sen could discern his
flaws.</p>
<p>Ghost Teeth Knife’s purple knifelight slashed down on Seven
Spirit. It created a spark and left a white mark on his golden
body. Then, it disappeared.</p>
<p>“What a powerful xenogeneic body!” Han Sen was shocked. He
didn’t cast Ghost Teeth Knife’s power a lot, but it was still easy
for him to kill an Earl. The fact that he couldn’t leave much of a
mark on Seven Spirit’s body spoke volumes about just how scary the
Buddha’s body was.</p>
<p>Seven Spirit looked furious. His eyes shone gold, and his eight
arms tried to generate a spirit to attack Han Sen. Now his body was
losing more and more control, though. Too many of his flaws were
being exposed. He couldn’t suppress Han Sen as he had earlier.</p>
<p>Han Sen depended entirely on his rabbit shoes for speed. The Red
Mink Gloves gave him increased power. With the two, Ghost Teeth
Knife continued to hack at the four-faced, eight-armed Buddha
body.</p>
<p>But his attacks could only leave white scrapes across the gold
body. The Teeth powers could not latch onto Seven Spirit.</p>
<p>Seven Spirit wished to escape Heaven now, but it was too late.
He fell back quickly, but the tolling of the bell was rather
frequent. It affected him more and more.</p>
<p>Before Seven Spirit escaped from Heaven, his body fell
completely into the dance. He couldn’t stop that strange dance, and
he couldn’t get out of Heaven.</p>
<p>Han Sen was so happy, and he kept slashing at Seven Spirit.
Using Jadeskin and Mutant Blood, he began to leave shallow marks on
the gold Buddha body.</p>
<p>But that was enough. If he could leave marks, the Teeth power
would slowly start to tear Seven Spirit’s body apart. Although it
was slow, over time, it’d be enough for him to kill Seven Spirit
and his Buddha body.</p>
<p>Seven Spirit kept roaring with his four faces. He wanted to take
control of his body and escape the Buddha Heaven, but his body had
been hijacked by the music. Regaining control was a very difficult
task.</p>
<p>“Why is he not affected? Impossible…” Seven Spirit Buddha took
another hit from Han Sen. His eyes gleamed gold, and he looked
angry.</p>
<p>Han Sen wanted to cut him a few more times before he left that
place. When he exited, the marks would kill the felon slowly
anyway. But before Han Sen could slash him again, Seven Spirit’s
eyes suddenly turned gold. Gold fire flared to life, and it burst
out to wrap up Seven Spirit’s body.</p>
<p>The body that had been affected by the music suddenly became
still, thanks to that gold flame. He had stopped dancing.</p>
<p>“Han Sen, I said we would meet again soon.” The four-faced,
eight-armed Buddha, which was enveloped in fire, opened its four
mouths to speak. A scary voice boomed out.</p>
<p>“Qing Jun!” Han Sen now knew who it was. The Sky God had been
behind everything this entire time.</p>
<p>Seven Spirit’s mind was completely under the control of Qing
Jun. And in his true form, he was not affected by the bell. He
cruelly laughed as he walked towards Han Sen. He said, “Han Sen, I
have waited a long, long time for this. But don’t worry; I won’t
kill you. You are a big delicious meal for one such as 1.1 will
feast on your fear, your tears, and your death.”</p>
<p>The voice of utter contempt echoed in Han Sen’s ears. Han Sen
felt terrible, but he brought out the red mist orb.</p>
<p>He couldn’t deal with Seven Spirit, and now it turned out that
he was being possessed by Sky God Qing Jun. There was no way Han
Sen could triumph now.</p>
<p>Han Sen planned on using Red Mist King for his final bid.
Although Red Mist King had barely any juice left in the tank, he’d
kill Seven Spirit if he could land a hit on him.</p>
<p>Qing Jung looked so mad as he flared with gold fire. His demonic
presence was insufferably strong, and it made the four-faced,
eight-armed Buddha body look even scarier. It was like he was going
to eat people.</p>
<p>Boom!</p>
<p>Qing Jun lifted his finger and gathered up a swirl of hot flame
atop it. The fire gathered up Seven Spirit’s Buddha light and flame
powers. He used it only for a second, and Han Sen felt himself
burn.</p>
<p>The four faces looked to be filled with vile hatred. Qing Jun
controlled Seven Spirit’s body. His fingers fired a gold flame
towards Han Sen.</p>
<p>But suddenly, a bag was hanging around Seven Spirit’s neck. The
bag was incinerated by the gold fire. There was a yellow spell
paper inside, and it was scorched.</p>
<p>When it burned, a weird light came out of the ash and went to
Seven Spirit’s forehead.</p>
<p>“Argh!” Han Sen heard a scream. The scream came from Qing
Jun.</p>
