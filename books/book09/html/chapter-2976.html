<p>Human King also gave him Blood-Pulse Sutra’s final part. He told
him that if he was willing to, all he had to do was practice the
final part for his blood to turn into blue blood. Although this
method was not as pure as passing it through generations, it would
still give Han Sen blueblood power.</p>
<p>The price to pay was that Han Sen would lose all the geno arts
he currently had. He would not even be able to make use of beast
souls. All he would be able to use was blueblood power.</p>
<p>Human King did not force Han Sen to do that. It was a decision
that had to be made by Han Sen.</p>
<p>Han Sen asked a few questions regarding Han Jinzhi. Human King
said Han Jinzhi was not a member of Blood Legion. He did not
possess blueblood. Aside from that, he did not say anything else
concerning him.</p>
<p>On his way back, Han Sen kept thinking, “Human King told me a
lot, but I feel like he was holding back on a lot of important
details.” He had yet to be given answers to many of the questions
he had. Han Sen also thought there was a big problem. He just did
not know what it was.</p>
<p>“What is up with Han Jinzhi? Human King should not be lying
about something like this, but why did the people of the seventh
team say Han Jinzhi had blueblood? What was that all about?” Han
Sen was very confused about this little nugget of information.</p>
<p>He thought his trip to Blood Legion would enable him to receive
answers concerning Han Jinzhi. Now, it seemed as if it was a
pointless venture. He still did not know anything about Han
Jinzhi.</p>
<p>Human King may have known something, but it was obvious he did
not want to spend much time talking about Han Jinzhi.</p>
<p>Han Sen returned to Space Garden. Nine-Thousand King had yet to
return, but another pair of guests had arrived.</p>
<p>The green-haired growler and Gana woman arrived at Space Garden.
When Han Sen saw them, the green-haired beast did not say anything.
It put its head in front of Han Sen and quietly groaned, “Sorry I
offended you. You can take my life, but please save Little Mountain
Leader.”</p>
<p>“Get up,” Han Sen said with a wave of his hand. “I am going to
save Little Gold Gold, but you guys should know my power is not
enough to fight Moment God yet. I require more time to prepare what
is necessary.”</p>
<p>“If there is something you need, please tell us,” the Gana woman
coldly said. “If it can save Little Mountain Leader, we will do
anything.”</p>
<p>“If you want to save Little Gold Gold from Moment God Temple, we
need more than just us. We require more aid. So I need resources to
make my friends stronger. If you guys have deified xenogeneic
genes, can you give them to me?” Han Sen thought Empty Mountain
must have had a lot of good stuff. Perhaps he was able to obtain
some resources from them.</p>
<p>“Empty Mountain has some deified xenogeneic genes,” the Gana
woman said. “I will give them to you later.”</p>
<p>They were currently unable to ask anyone else for help. Han Sen
was the only person they could turn to. At least they knew Han Sen
truly wanted to save Golden Growler.</p>
<p>“That Dollar really is bad stuff,” the green-haired growler
madly said. “Little Mountain Leader gave him the first seat on the
god list. Yet when Little Mountain Leader was in trouble, he did
not show up.”</p>
<p>Han Sen gave a wry smile and thought that Dollar did not show up
because he was blown up, but what the green-haired growler said
reminded Han Sen that Golden Growler gave Dollar the god list first
place. If Dollar still did not show up, it might make him look
bad.</p>
<p>Although Dollar’s race was different from Han Sen and no one
expected him to be Han Sen, it was still wrong.</p>
<p>After sending the green-haired growler and Gana woman away, Han
Sen thought about matters for a while. He eventually decided to
challenge the God Spirit with Dollar’s identity.</p>
<p>This time, the God Spirit Han Sen decided to challenge was not
Moment God. It was going to be the Disaster class No World God.</p>
<p>Han Sen heard the demon lady say that No World God’s power could
enable him to be immune to time powers for a while. If he was able
to get his hands on No World God’s god personality armament, it
would be a great help for saving Golden Growler.</p>
<p>When there was no one around, Han Sen turned into xenogeneic
mode and equipped himself with his Dongxuan Armor. He then wore the
Sky God Crown.</p>
<p>The Sky God Crown was an Annihilation class god personality
armament. It was two levels higher than the Sky Vine Radish God
Lance. It was a god personality armament that was almost as good as
Moment God.</p>
<p>Han Sen had never used the Sky God Crown before because he did
not know what power it possessed.</p>
<p>It was not like it was high level or automatically useful like
the Light Well Lotus beast soul. Although it was a high-level beast
soul, its power involved healing. In a deathmatch battle, it would
not serve much of a purpose.</p>
<p>Han Sen thought, “Back then, God said the Sky God Crown would
allow me to enter the geno halls freely. Now, the geno halls are
all on display. Does the Sky God Crown have any other uses?” After
thinking for a while, he had decided to wear the Sky God Crown.</p>
<p>The moment Han Sen put on the Sky God Crown, a god light mist
like a rainbow came down. It covered his entire body. From afar,
Han Sen looked like a godly rainbow mist.</p>
<p>Katcha!</p>
<p>Han Sen saw the universe’s cogwheels spin. It was like there was
a giant mechanical door opening in front of him. This was like the
core area or the god area opening.</p>
<p>The door did not open solely for Han Sen. It was because of the
Sky God Crown.</p>
<p>Han Sen looked at the space door. He saw a rainbow mist light.
Countless substance chains were connected. One was not able to see
what it was.</p>
<p>After hesitating for a moment, Han Sen walked toward the rainbow
mist light that was flowing around the door. After his body
completely walked through the door, the door closed. It disappeared
back into the nether of space. The weird scene was gone too.</p>
<p>“This is…God temple…” Han Sen frowned and looked at what was in
front of him.</p>
<p>It was a jade stone god temple. Beneath Han Sen’s feet was a god
temple. He saw Sky Vine Radish God be revived in this temple. He
was not wrong about that. This was a god temple, and he was
standing on the altar of the god temple.</p>
<p>“Annihilation god temple opened. Name the god temple.” A voice
echoed through the god temple. A god flag flew toward Han Sen.</p>
<p>“What is going on? Did I become a God Spirit?” Han Sen frowned
and looked at the empty god flag. The god flag he used to see
already had names. This one was empty. There was nothing on the
flag.</p>
<p>Han Sen did not want to be a God Spirit. Even if it was an
Annihilation class God Spirit, he did not want that.</p>
<p>“You are finally here.” As Han Sen hesitated, the god temple’s
door opened. A girl walked in. It was Gu Wan’er. Upon hearing her
tone of voice, Han Sen knew that it was not Gu Wan’er in that body.
It was that guy who called himself God.</p>
