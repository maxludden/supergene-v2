<h2>Expensive Life</h2>
<h3>Chapter 2946</h3>

<p>Han Sen did not have many high expectations. After all, its
mother had a soul that weighed a measly 26 kilograms. The small
goldfish’s soul would likely be less than half of that.</p>
<p>But the fate monument’s number managed to hit three digits, and
it was increasing fast. The numbers were rising like mad. A second
later, it hit four digits.</p>
<p>“The soul is so weird. They are blood-related, but the weight of
the soul has a massive difference.” Han Sen was shocked.</p>
<p>Nine Thousand King, who was nearby, said, “Although the soul is
very ancient, under ordinary circumstances, it is hard for anyone
to see souls. Only xenogeneic treasures like the fate monument can
look into the soul you have. The weight of the soul is very hard to
explain. Some low-level creatures have a very heavy soul. Some
high-level creatures have a very light soul. Even if they are born
from the same mother, their souls can be vastly different. It is
hard to tell the rules and what determines the weight of a
soul.”</p>
<p>Han Sen nodded. He looked at the small goldfish’s number jumping
up. After a while, the small goldfish’s soul number came to a stop
at 7,493.</p>
<p>Nine Thousand King saw the little goldfish’s soul test come to a
stop and sighed. “A 7,000 soul? It still has a lot to go before
hitting 10,000.”</p>
<p>Ancient Abyss Grandmaster said, “What a shame. If one of us can
hit 10,000, perhaps we can get out of this.”</p>
<p>Han Sen looked at Ancient Abyss Grandmaster and asked, “Ancient
Abyss Grandmaster, have you conducted your own test?”</p>
<p>“Our people have already tested. There have been a few hundred
to a few thousand. No one reached 10,000. If one of us had managed
to do that, we wouldn’t have been trapped here.” Ancient Abyss
paused before saying to Han Sen, “Now, there is only you and your
daughter than has not conducted the test. I hope one of you can
have a 10,000-kilogram soul so we can leave. Otherwise, we are all
trapped here.”</p>
<p>Han Sen nodded. He pricked his finger and drew out a drop of
blood. He threw it at the fate monument.</p>
<p>Han Sen’s blood was red. It was red like a ruby. It landed on
the fate monument and shattered. The fate monument absorbed it. The
entire monument turned into a crystal ruby.</p>
<p>The numbers on top of the monument showed up. They were jumping
so fast. The numbers increased and quickly hit three digits.</p>
<p>Nine Thousand King saw Han Sen’s soul was over a thousand. He
looked jealous as he said, “Mister, you have an expensive life. You
have reached four digits so fast. It looks like hitting 10,000 will
not be difficult for you.”</p>
<p>“You overestimate him,” Sky Palace’s first seat coldly said.</p>
<p>The other people did not know about this, but he did. Han Sen
was a creature from the sanctuaries, and he had seen Han Sen’s
talents. His genes were not stable, and his talents were just
average.</p>
<p>Although the weight of the soul had nothing to do with one’s
genes or talents, the rules of the sanctuaries would hurt the soul.
Not many people knew that.</p>
<p>Sky Palace’s first seat wanted to force his way into the
sanctuaries. He had been hurt before by it, so he knew all about
it.</p>
<p>Many race elites knew the crystallizers had escaped to the
sanctuaries. Under the rules of there, they would not believe the
soul of a crystallizer could be greater than 10,000 once they
left.</p>
<p>Ancient Abyss Grandmasters and the others stared at the fate
monument’s number. This could free them. They were hoping Han Sen’s
soul could exceed 10,000.</p>
<p>Nine Thousand King heard Sky Palace’s first seat and felt a bit
angry. He coldly said, “Mister’s life is very expensive. Cheap
people like you cannot measure it.”</p>
<p>“Oh, really? I would like to see how expensive his life is.” Sky
Palace’s first seat spoke gently, but his face made Nine Thousand
King very mad. He wanted to kill him with his hands.</p>
<p>“Five thousand…” an Extreme King could saw that Han Sen’s soul
weighed above 5,000, which gave them hope.</p>
<p>“Eight thousand…” Ancient Abyss’ eyes started to change.</p>
<p>After nine thousand, even Sky Palace’s first seat’s eyes looked
strange. Clearly, he had a hard time believing that Han Sen, a
person who had come from the sanctuaries, possessed such a heavy
soul.</p>
<p>“Weird. The rules of the sanctuaries claim they will reduce your
soul. He comes from the sanctuaries. Why would he have such a heavy
soul?” Sky Palace’s first seat frowned.</p>
<p>The number kept on jumping. It was getting very close to 9,999.
The few deifieds of the Extreme King held their breath. They stared
at the number on the monument. They hoped the number would jump
even faster to reach the breakthrough.</p>
<p>Finally, as everyone watched, the four-digit number reached
nines across the board. It became 9999. At the same time, the
number on the fate monument stopped.</p>
<p>It had instantly stopped, but in the eyes of the deifieds, it
felt like a century.</p>
<p>In the next moment, the number on the stone monument jumped.
This time, the number did not increase. Instead, the numbers
returned to zero.</p>
<p>Everyone was shocked. A deified Extreme King said, “What is
going on? I thought once you reach 10,000 kilograms you are allowed
to escape the suppression of the fate monument. Why has the soul’s
weight suddenly returned to zero?”</p>
<p>“There is no way Han Sen’s soul is just 9,999. He only needed
one more to reach 10,000.”</p>
<p>“Go and look behind the monument. See if Han Sen’s soul is
there.”</p>
<p>Everyone went around the back of the monument for a look.
Suddenly, the fate monument was shining brightly. The fate monument
was dyed red because of Han Sen’s blood. It released 10,000 bright
lights. It was like 10,000 glistening waterdrops were flowing
out.</p>
<p>The whole ground started to shake. The 10,000 lights of the fate
monument were rising. They left the ground and floated in the
air.</p>
<p>“Roar!”</p>
<p>Everyone was shocked when they heard the fate monument make a
sound like a beast roaring. It was like a tiger or a dragon.
Everybody next saw the red fate monument turn into holy white. A
white, jade looking Holy Kirin beast came out of the sky. The holy
light on it was like a sun. It lit up the entire dark area.</p>
<p>The broken floor… The ruined buildings… All the broken machines…
With the Holy Kirin’s very bright, holy light, Han Sen and the
others saw everything clearly.</p>
<p>Aside from that, fairy-looking shadows were floating across the
ruins. These fairy bodies were half-transparent. They looked like
blue jelly.</p>
<p>“These are space charms.” Han Sen suddenly remembered the
description of them from Nine Thousand King.</p>
