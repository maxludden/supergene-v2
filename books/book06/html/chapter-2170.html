<p>Han Sen squinted his eyes. That scary presence carried enough
overwhelming force to sunder the sturdiest stone. It rolled over
the region like a wave.</p>
<p>The man was approaching, and he was terrifying. Han Sen felt as
if the sky itself had changed color. The man’s presence battered
him over and over, like a ceaseless tide.</p>
<p>“Who are you?” Han Sen stood and squinted, peering at the
oncoming form. The wind was tugging his clothes back, making them
ripple in the gusts.</p>
<p>But Han Sen stood strong. He held his position as if that power
did not exist, at all.</p>
<p>The person walked onwards without saying a word. And with every
step the form took, it sounded like rocks were being broken
underfoot.</p>
<p>Dong!</p>
<p>A very light footstep then took its place, reverberating through
Han Sen’s ear. But it had the impact of an explosion inside Han
Sen’s head. It made Han Sen squint his eyes even harder.</p>
<p>Dong! Dong! Dong! Dong!</p>
<p>The shadow approached, closer and closer. The footsteps were
like a chain of explosions, going off inside Han Sen’s head, one
after the next. And along with all that, the person’s presence was
becoming scarier was every step.</p>
<p>Han Sen looked at the body, and he noticed that they were both
of a similar height. But in Han Sen’s eyes, the person seemed
greater than him. He got the sense that the other person was a god
that towered over him, making him feel small and insignificant in
comparison.</p>
<p>Han Sen knew that this had to be an illusion. But even so, if
this person could use their powers to such a degree, it was
unlikely that an ordinary person could fight against it.</p>
<p>“Since when does an elite like this exist within the race of the
Rebate?” Han Sen was confused by this presence.</p>
<p>The body and its presence were scary, to say the least. But its
lifeforce certainly wasn’t King class. It was a Duke, at the most.
Still, Han Sen couldn’t think of anyone else across the entirety of
Narrow Moon that carried an aura such as that, especially as a
Duke.</p>
<p>The person continued approaching, but try as they might to
subdue Han Sen with fear, the attempt failed. Han Sen did not move.
The person eventually stopped walking at a distance of ten steps
away from Han Sen. She stood where she was and just looked at
him.</p>
<p>Now Han Sen could tell that the person was actually a woman. She
was clad in black armor and also a helmet. Her face would have been
revealed, had it not been for the face mask she wore. The features
of her face were covered, save for the beautiful golden eyes that
gleamed from her mask. But it was evident how fit the woman was
based on the curves that the armor revealed.</p>
<p>She was as tall as Han Sen, and so her longs were very
attractive.</p>
<p>But Han Sen’s gaze wasn’t drawn to her eyes or her legs. He was
actually looking at her left hand.</p>
<p>Her right hand was covered in a black gauntlet, revealing only
the length of her fingers. Her left hand, however, was bare. The
skin of her hands was pure white, her fingers were slender, and her
delicate nails were like crystal gemstones.</p>
<p>But Han Sen was not merely admiring the prettiness of it. He
looked there because of the power that swirled in her palm. It was
a power he could not accurately describe.</p>
<p>With no shocking godlight or scary flames, the hand suddenly
closed into an elegant fist and shot toward Han Sen. Han Sen’s eyes
locked onto the fist that was headed his way.</p>
<p>And as the fist traveled to Han Sen, he quivered. He did not
shudder in fear, though; his twitch was him activating all the
power inside him.</p>
<p>Han Sen’s body gave that single shiver, and all of his power
surged up, ready to be unleashed.</p>
<p>The pressure he felt from that incoming punch prompted Han Sen
to gather up all the power he could. Standing before the
black-armored woman, he felt a grave sense of danger.</p>
<p>Han Sen had no intention of dodging, though. When the punch was
swung, it felt as if the entirety of that pocket of space was
filled up by it. That fist was everywhere, and it seemed as if
there was no place for him to run to, even if he wanted to do
so.</p>
<p>Naturally, Han Sen was not actually planning to hide. He
clenched his right hand into a fist, filled it with the gathered
power of his trembling body, then sent a return punch at the
woman.</p>
<p>The fires that carried the fist were very demonic. They were
tinged with scary Teeth powers, and they came right at the woman’s
fist.</p>
<p>The fists came against each other, and the power inside Han
Sen’s fist shattered. The jade fist had collided with Han Sen’s own
with tremendous force.</p>
<p>Boom!</p>
<p>Han Sen felt the unstoppable powers coming from that jade fist.
It was like a supernova, and the unleashed force hurled Han Sen
away.</p>
<p>Han Sen used his legs to cleave a trench through the stones and
the earth, trying to stabilize himself. But the power that sent him
flying was too great. He tore through the ground for a few hundred
meters before crashing into a stone wall that exploded on
impact.</p>
<p>And while the wall might have been destroyed, Han Sen was still
standing. His right hand was injured, and his bones were cracked,
though.</p>
<p>“Who are you?” Han Sen asked the woman again.</p>
<p>The woman’s fist was so strange. It felt like something entirely
indestructible. Even someone as strong as Han Sen could not
withstand the force it unleashed.</p>
<p>And after Han Sen had taken that punch, he knew for certain that
the frightening, black-armored woman was actually a Marquise just
like he was.</p>
<p>That surprised Han Sen more than anything. With this power she
wielded, there was every possibility that she was even stronger
than Lone Bamboo. That scary punching power was a testament to
that.</p>
<p>Han Sen thought he might have to retaliate with Break Six Skies.
That could be the only way to combat her fist effectively.</p>
<p>“You can withstand my Extreme King Final Punch? It is no wonder
you are regarded as being as good as Lone Bamboo. You have passed.”
The woman’s golden eyes peered at Han Sen. Her voice was icy, but
also very seductive. “I will give you a chance to join the
knights.”</p>
<p>“You are of the Extreme King?” Han Sen looked at the woman while
he spoke.</p>
<p>Yes,” the woman answered.</p>
<p>“Did you come all the way over here just to cause me trouble?”
Han Sen asked.</p>
<p>The woman replied in a toneless voice, “I was here to deliver a
recruitment paper for Yisha. I was going to leave, but I heard that
you were in the vicinity. So, I came to take a look at the
individual who is said to be as strong as Lone Bamboo himself. You
have most certainly passed, and so, I extend you an invitation to
join the knights.”</p>
<p>“I’m sorry, but I’ve made no plans to abandon Narrow Moon.” Han
Sen was on high alert as he spoke. He was prepared for the
possibility that the woman might attack again.</p>
<p>But the woman wasn’t planning to. When Han Sen declined, she
turned around and left.</p>
<p>Han Sen watched her fit body as she walked away, her long blonde
hair rippling behind her. But the sight was tinged with sorrow, as
if to tell Han Sen that he had no idea what he had just missed out
on.</p>
<p>“What an arrogant woman,” Han Sen thought to himself.</p>
