    <p>
      The bloodline of the Sacred egg came from both Sacred’s master and
      Destroyer Empress, but after absorbing the power of death from Rolling
      Dragon King and the black dragon and being born from the black pond, she
      had too much deathly power. Her hereditary abilities from Destroyer
      Empress were completely activated, and they suppressed her inheritance
      from Sacred’s master.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was too much deathly power piling up in her body, which was very bad
      for a newborn baby.
    </p>
    <p>
      If the newborn baby kept absorbing the power of death, it would become
      exactly the same as Destroyer Empress, and there would be nothing special
      about her.
    </p>
    <p>
      Destroyer Wolf drained the blood of the newborn, and at the same time, it
      also took away the excessive deathly power inside her. That meant the
      Destroyer Wolf didn’t actually merge all the genes of the newborn;
      instead, it only obtained the genes of her destruction abilities.
    </p>
    <p>
      The blood and genes of the newborn were finally balanced, as her whole
      body was now growing instead of just the part that belonged to Destroyer
      Empress.
    </p>
    <p>
      However, she didn’t only lose the power that had been dammed up inside
      her. She also lost her blood, which had caused her to slip into a coma.
      When Han Sen’s blood fell on her body and soaked into her, she recovered
      quickly.
    </p>
    <p>
      As the newborn absorbed Han Sen’s blood, she obtained some of his genes,
      and her own genes also changed slightly because of the blood she absorbed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Han Sen’s blood was like a geno solution, which merged the two different
      bloodlines of the newborn and created a unique new power that neither of
      the original powers possessed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Han Sen didn’t expect his blood to be this useful. At that time, he was
      spewing out his blood recklessly. Blood kept bursting from the stone pipe,
      and though it wasn’t hitting the Destroyer Wolf, the enormous power was
      enough to destroy an entire mountain.
    </p>
    <p>
      After Han Sen fired four or five bloody arrows, the mountains around them
      were already in ruins.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ghost Eye was walking around with two super creatures, looking for any
      opportunities that might come their way.
    </p>
    <p>
      As they walked, they watched the mountains nearby explode, and then Han
      Sen and the Destroyer Wolf flew by in front of them.
    </p>
    <p>
      Han Sen fired at the Destroyer Wolf with Blow Blood. The blood light
      shone, and the Destroyer Wolf dodged. The mountain behind the wolf wasn’t
      so lucky. The trace of blood light ravaged the mountain, and that power
      was mesmerizing.
    </p>
    <p>
      “That is Blow Blood… No way…” Ghost Eye opened its eyes and mouth wide,
      and it looked like it had just eaten a fly.
    </p>
    <p>
      It had been kept Blow Blood for a long time, so it knew the geno core
      perfectly well. It could easily identify the weapon in Han Sen’s hands. It
      tried to console itself that Han Sen might be wielding some other geno
      core.
    </p>
    <p>
      After a short while, Ghost Eye saw the power of Blow Blood just as
      described in the legends, and the creature couldn’t lie to himself
      anymore.
    </p>
    <p>
      “D<em>mn. That’s Blow Blood. Is that b</em>stard the master of the geno
      core? How did he activate it?” Ghost Eye was so upset that it started to
      see red. Its eyes popped, and it watched Han Sen fight Destroyer Wolf in
      the sky.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Little master, that seems to be Destroyer Wolf. What happened to him?” a
      super creature asked while staring at the Destroyer Wolf.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Is that Destroyer Wolf? The rumors say that it’s a giant wolf, and it’s
      white.” Ghost Eye said, glancing at the wolf in the sky.
    </p>
    <p>
      “I… I am not sure whether that is it or not…” The super creature
      hesitated.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Destroyer Wolf now looked completely different than it had before, and
      the characteristics of its power had changed sharply as well. Even those
      who had seen it before couldn’t be sure if this was actually it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Han Sen then yelled loudly, “Destroyer Wolf is here! It has eaten the
      Sacred egg!”
    </p>
    <p>
      Han Sen’s voice wasn’t loud, but he was powerful, and his voice spread
      widely. Those like Goddess, who were already attracted by the ripples of
      power, were deeply upset upon hearing what Han Sen said. They flew across
      the sky and rushed toward Destroyer Wolf.
    </p>
    <p>
      “You deserve to die, Destroyer Wolf!” Goddess’s face turned pale with
      rage. She also saw the power of destruction coming from the Destroyer
      Wolf, so she didn’t have any doubts anymore. She rushed toward it with the
      super creatures following her.
    </p>
    <p>
      “I’ve already obtained the most perfect and powerful genes. I will
      definitely rule the world in the future. If you want to make yourself my
      enemy, you’re the one that deserves to die.” Destroyer Wolf couldn’t be
      more arrogant, and it now looked upon those from Sacred shelter with
      disdain. Its powers of space and berserk death combined in its body, and
      it wanted to fight the five enemies all at once and kill them all.
    </p>
    <p>
      Instead of fighting Destroyer Wolf, Han Sen quickly escaped from the
      battlefield. He landed on a mountain in the distance to watch the fight.
    </p>
    <p>
      All the powerful creatures nearby rushed toward the fight after hearing
      what had happened. They all gathered to watch the fight between Destroyer
      Wolf and Goddess’s group.
    </p>
    <p>
      All four of the super creatures beside Goddess were renowned beings who
      had impressive reputations in Sacred shelter, but now, they were all
      simultaneously suppressed by the Destroyer Wolf. They had to retreat again
      and again, and it seemed that they were not the Destroyer Wolf’s match.
    </p>
    <p>
      Xu Mi had staid beside Rolling Dragon Lake all along, and he refused to
      leave. He saw Destroyer Wolf and a strange creature rush out of the lake,
      but he didn’t see Han Sen. He was kind of worried.
    </p>
    <p>
      Just as he wanted to enter the water to see if Han Sen had run into some
      danger, he saw Bao’er exit the water and jump to the shore.
    </p>
    <p>“Bao’er, where is my teacher?” asked Xu Mi to Bao’er.</p>
    <p>
      “Father still has something to do down there. He told me to tell you that
      you don’t need to worry about him, and don’t go into the water,” Bao’er
      said, blinking her eyes.
    </p>
    <p>Xu Mi felt relieved, and he turned to watch the fight in the sky.</p>
    <p>
      “Anyone who helps me kill Destroyer Wolf will be greatly rewarded by
      Sacred shelter,” yelled Goddess. There were five of them fighting one
      Destroyer Wolf, yet they were still not its match. The body of one of the
      super creatures was torn apart by the Destroyer Wolf, and its blood
      splashed across the sky.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Don’t worry, Goddess. I’ll come help you.” Yu Miao rushed toward them
      with some spirits. Nobody knew what she was thinking as she aided Goddess.
    </p>
    <p>
      Not only Yu Miao, but many great beings rushed toward the Destroyer Wolf.
      All of a sudden, there were terrifying lifeforces flowing everywhere.
    </p>
    <p>
      After consuming the blood of the newborn, the Destroyer Wolf was indeed
      incredible. It was fighting so many creatures all by itself, yet nobody
      was able to do anything to it.
    </p>
    <p>
      “You dare to antagonize me! I’ll kill you all today!” Destroyer Wolf
      yelled at the sky, and terrifying deathly power burst from the creature.
    </p>
    <p>
      Han Sen watched in the distance for a while, yet those great beings were
      all crushed by Destroyer Wolf. Their attempts at entrapment were useless
      against an enemy that could travel through space.
