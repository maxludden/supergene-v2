<p>“I can’t tell. Your genes are good if you managed to make the
flowers ring.” Lan Se told Han Sen as they drove away.</p>
<p>“If I have good genes, does that mean I am eligible for a good
job?” Han Sen smiled.</p>
<p>“Although I would like to give you a good job, you are too weak.
Eleven flowers will prohibit you from doing anything half- decent.”
Lan Se then asked, “What is your race, might I ask?”</p>
<p>“Human,” Han Sen said.</p>
<p>Lan Sen had never heard of the race before, so it must have been
something small and insignificant. Therefore, she did not ask any
more questions.</p>
<p>She brought Han Sen to the job center and helped him browse
through possible options. She let him pick out what he liked
first.</p>
<p>Normal people weren’t given this sort of treatment, but Han
Sen’s genes had made the bells ring. It made Lan Se look up to him,
and so she was willing to let him pick and choose.</p>
<p>It wasn’t certain that he’d be able to generate a geno weapon,
but people admired creatures who were superior. And this was within
Lan Se’s authority to grant.</p>
<p>Han Sen looked at what was available for him, but all he could
see was something that was the equivalent of washing dishes. A job
like that required neither skill nor strength.</p>
<p>There weren’t any options here that Han Sen really liked, and
there was nothing that would be challenging. But it was getting
late, and there were people waiting for him to decide. He had to
pick something. It was a shame there weren’t many options.</p>
<p>“That one.” Han Sen pointed at the job of his choosing.</p>
<p>“A grave watcher? Not a bad choice. This is a public place, so
you can live there, as well. There is no need to look for
additional housing.” Lan Se began sorting out the necessary
paperwork for him.</p>
<p>And then, Han Sen became a grave watcher. He guarded the
cemetery gates and kept the place tidy.</p>
<p>This was different than what Han Sen expected he’d be doing. The
graveyard was not scary, and all the headstones were surprisingly
clean.</p>
<p>Lan Se said it was a public graveyard, and there were over ten
thousand graves there. If people lacked money, or if bodies were
recovered and were unable to be identified, they’d be buried here.
Other creatures would also be placed to rest here, too.</p>
<p>It was different from how the Alliance dealt with matters of
death. The graves here were simple. There was merely a name and
date of passing written on the headstones there. Some had small
samples of text, too.</p>
<p>Aside from Han Sen, there was another grave watcher, too. But
this man was very old. They only had to guard the place, and so
they would probably get bored easily. When they were bored, he
supposed they could take the time to scrub the tablets and keep
them all neat.</p>
<p>Planet Kate was a nice place, all things considered. The tree
leaves didn’t even fall. Han Sen was rather satisfied with the job
he had selected.</p>
<p>Lan Se and the old grave watcher explained to Han Sen his living
situation and responsibilities, and when she was done, she
left.</p>
<p>She told Han Sen that his co-worker was called Old Ku. He was a
decent chap, and Old Ku brought Han Sen over to where he was going
to live. He didn’t have to jump into work immediately, though. He
was given the opportunity to get used to the place first</p>
<p>There was one thing that Han Sen noticed immediately; the other
grave watcher lacked Lan Se’s powers of communication. Han Sen
didn’t understand what the old man was telling him, but he could at
least feel that the gravewatcher wasn’t being hostile.</p>
<p>There was nothing to do after clocking in. All the plots in the
graveyard were filled, and no more dead people would be sent there
for burial. So, aside from opening the gates for visitors, there
was nothing to be done.</p>
<p>Han Sen walked around the graveyard, observing the place. If
something happened, he wanted to ensure he had an escape route
pre-planned.</p>
<p>Han Sen kept walking to get familiar with the place. He also
examined the headstones of the graves themselves to see what was
written on them. The text on most of them was of the language of
Planet Kate. Han Sen couldn’t understand the writing, but the
formatting suggested only the names and dates were written on
them.</p>
<p>But suddenly, Han Sen’s body was delivered a huge shock. He saw
one headstone with the name Han Jinzhi written on it</p>
<p>Han Sen quickly walked over to get a closer look, and it really
did say Han Jinzhi. And the text was the one used by ancient
humans.</p>
<p>“No way! Han Jinzhi got out and died here!” Han Sen examined the
grave closely. The only thing written there was the name. There
wasn’t a date listed. There was an additional line of words, but it
wasn’t of the ancient human language. It looked like the Kate
language.</p>
<p>“Have you grown accustomed to living here?” A familiar voice
came from his side.</p>
<p>Han Sen saw Old Cat on a gravestone, smiling at him.</p>
<p>“Where did you go? If you followed me, why didn’t you help me
explain my situation to them?” Han Sen sounded angry.</p>
<p>Old Cat laughed. “I told you; Nine-Life Cats don’t have a very
good reputation out here. If I was with you, you wouldn’t be having
the comfy living you are now.”</p>
<p>“Isn’t this Nine-Life Cat’s territory? I thought the Planet Kate
people, with all their cat ears, would be related to you.” Han Sen
looked surprised.</p>
<p>“Related? Eh, maybe a little. But it’s not a good association.
Don’t let them see your Nine-Life Cat tattoo, okay? If that thing
gets you killed, just don’t take it out on me,” Old Cat said.</p>
<p>Han Sen was too lazy to talk to Old Cat much more, but he did
ask, “What happened here, anyway? Can I go home?”</p>
<p>Old Cat went silent, then said, “Since you are out, you’ll learn
soon, anyway. Planet Kate is at the edge of the Big Silence system.
And the Big Silence system is a restricted area of the galaxy. It’s
dangerous out here. Even Nobles can be killed. You would be far
worse.”</p>
<p>“Are you trying to tell me the entrance of the sanctuary is here
in the Big Silence system?” Han Sen said, looking at Old Cat.</p>
<p>“Yes, but it is not too difficult to go back. I am powerful, and
I can take you to the entrance. But this is a big risk, so you’ll
have to pay me something that’ll make the venture worth it.” Old
Cat smiled.</p>
<p>“What do you want?” Han Sen frowned.</p>
<p>“Didn’t you get one of those bones from the Feather? Give me a
hundred of those and I’ll send you.” Old Cat seemed to have
prepared this demand in advance.</p>
