<h2>Killing Underwater Xenogeneics</h2>
<h3>Chapter 2357</h3>

<p>Because Han Sen was uncertain of Miss Mirror’s ultimate goal, he
didn’t dare take any obvious risks. He remained on Planet Water
Zone and spent his time hunting down Duke xenogeneics. He wanted to
fill up his Duke genes.</p>
<p>Han Sen found a few Duke xenogeneics, killed them, and consumed
their Duke genes. Their xenogeneic genes increased his Duke gene
tally by one point each, so leveling up was a very slow process. It
wasn’t as fast as eating one King xenogeneic gene to claim ten Duke
gene points.</p>
<p>He didn’t want to cause much of a ruckus. He needed to be
patient and slowly trawl through Planet Water Zone in the hunt for
Duke xenogeneics.</p>
<p>“What is this?” Han Sen came across a little mountain moving
across the bottom of the sea. It slid forward at a very slow pace,
but Han Sen could tell that it really was moving.</p>
<p>When Han Sen rode the blood kirin down to get a better look, he
realized that it wasn’t actually a mountain. It was a conch. The
shell was one hundred meters tall. It was black and greyish, and it
looked like stone from a distance.</p>
<p>Beneath the conch, the white skirt of the conch was revealed. It
was slowly flapping and moving across the sand.</p>
<p>Feeling Han Sen and the blood kirin draw near, the mountainous
conch moved its flesh and released a blue light. It covered an area
of one thousand meters, cloaking Han Sen and the blood kirin at the
same time.</p>
<p>The blood kirin was angered. His blood air exploded out from him
as he thundered toward the sea conch.</p>
<p>Han Sen didn’t know what the sea conch’s area did. It didn’t
seem to affect Han Sen directly. The blood kirin soon came before
the sea conch, though, with that blood air swirling all around
him.</p>
<p>The sea conch retreated back into its shell as the blood kirin’s
claws skittered across the hard surface of the shell, leaving some
scratch marks across it.</p>
<p>The blood kirin roared in fury. It kept swinging its claws at
the conch, trying to break through the shell. But despite its
strength, the blood kirin couldn’t leave behind anything more than
light scratches. The conch shell was one hundred meters tall, so
those scratches were inconsequential.</p>
<p>“A King class xenogeneic?” Han Sen was delighted by this
discovery. If its shell was that sturdy, the creature must have
been King class. A weak King class, judging by its fleshy body, but
a King class nonetheless.</p>
<p>The blood kirin continued striking the shell, but each blow left
less and less of a mark. It was rather confusing to Han Sen.</p>
<p>Han Sen pulled out his Ghost Teeth Knife and swiped across the
shell. It did nothing, and his performance paled in comparison to
the blood kirin’s.</p>
<p>Han Sen frowned. He pulled out his Thunder God Spike, summoned
its lightning, then thrust it toward the sea conch’s shell. He
wanted to paralyze the beast. After that, he could flip it on its
back and slay it from below.</p>
<p>But the creature’s shell seemed to insulate it perfectly from
the lightning of the Thunder God Spike. That made Han Sen raise an
eyebrow. “This guy’s shell is really hard. But it is so big. I bet
it would make an amazing armor.”</p>
<p>The shell was far too large to be used for a single set of
armor. Still, it would make an excellent construction material for
something larger.</p>
<p>Before Han Sen could make something out of it, though, he first
had to kill it. He tried all sorts of different powers, but his
strongest attack could only deliver a mark that was a few inches
across. It had no effect on the sea conch.</p>
<p>“Let’s flip it!” Han Sen called to the blood kirin. Gathering
their strength, they turned the sea conch over. After flipping it,
though, they realized it was sealed on the bottom. There was no way
in. The opening was blocked by the same material that composed the
rest of the shell.</p>
<p>As they looked over the creature again, Han Sen and the blood
kirin realized that the marks they had left on its shell had
vanished. Their efforts had been wasted.</p>
<p>“This isn’t right. This guy probably has a third-tier area. How
else could the conch shell be so hard? Even the blood kirin, with
an attack at full power, only leaves a small mark…” Han Sen looked
around at the blue lights of the area that was all around. “How
does this conch have such a powerful king area?”</p>
<p>They had been there for a long time, but the blue light hadn’t
done any damage to Han Sen or the blood kirin. It certainly wasn’t
meant as an attack.</p>
<p>“Is this a weakening area, perhaps?” Han Sen considered the
possibility, but it didn’t seem quite right.</p>
<p>If it was a weakening area, he should have been able to feel his
own power losing strength. Han Sen wasn’t sensing any energy drain,
though; his body was full of vigor.</p>
<p>“If it isn’t a weakening type, then could it be a
cell-strengthening type? Does the blue light increase the shell’s
strength?” Han Sen stroked his jaw as he thought about this, but he
ultimately discarded this idea as well.</p>
<p>If it was a cell-strengthening area, the sea conch wouldn’t have
needed to release the light into such a large area. The wider the
area, the more spread out the power would be. The
cell-strengthening area would only be required around the shell
itself. Why would the creature need to extend its reach so far?</p>
<p>“If it isn’t a weakening or a cell-strengthening area, what is
it?” Han Sen stared at the sea conch as he mulled over the
conundrum.</p>
<p>The blood kirin had a short temper, and its inability to damage
the sea conch’s shell was making the blood kirin more and more
furious. It kept trying to bite the shell, but nothing worked. The
marks they left were becoming lighter and lighter.</p>
<p>“Hang on… The blood kirin’s power hasn’t weakened. In fact, his
anger has made him even stronger. Why are his scratch marks
becoming lighter?” Han Sen stared at the scratch marks on the conch
shell. After a while, his eyes sparkled. “Is his area power…”</p>
<p>Han Sen swam next to the conch shell and stroked the scratch
marks across its surface. The blood kirin stopped attacking.</p>
<p>Not long after, the scratch marks were gone. The healing
unfolded before their eyes.</p>
<p>If even a top-class half-deified creature like the blood kirin
couldn’t break the conch’s shell, then the shell was unbelievably
hard.</p>
<p>Han Sen didn’t think that the strength was coming from the
material of the shell, though. The conch shell was very hard, but
its incredible resistance was because of the creature’s King
area.</p>
<p>Han Sen didn’t know if his guess was correct, so after a moment
of thought, he took the blood kirin and left. They departed the sea
conch’s area of blue light.</p>
<p>The sea conch behaved as if it knew what they were doing. It
spread the blue light further, but the max range was two thousand
meters. It couldn’t extend the light beyond that.</p>
<p>When Han Sen and the blood kirin got far enough away that the
sea conch couldn’t feel their presence, they hid behind a big rock,
Han Sen used his Purple-Eye Butterfly to observe the sea conch in
the distance.</p>
<p>The sea conch waited there for a while. It must have been almost
half an hour before the creature emerged from the shell to look
around. After a while, when it didn’t see Han Sen and the blood
kirin in the vicinity, it shut off its blue light.</p>
<p>Upon seeing that, Han Sen summoned Spell. He turned her into a
sniper rifle and took aim at the sea conch.</p>
<p>Pang!</p>
<p>Without hesitation, Han Sen squeezed the trigger. The bullet
fired out of the barrel and broke through the water. It was
silently headed for the sea conch.</p>
