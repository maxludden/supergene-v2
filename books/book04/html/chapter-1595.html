    <p>
      Han Sen and the others were all surprised. They had never heard of the
      singing voice in the storm calling someone’s name. However, there was no
      mistaking what the voice was saying now; it was clearly calling Han Sen.
    </p>
    <p>
      Han Sen grabbed Lin Feng and said, “Wait a minute, something’s wrong.”
    </p>
    <p>
      Lin Feng shook his head and said, “I have to go no matter what. Otherwise,
      I’ll never forgive myself.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Okay, then I’ll come with you.” Han Sen took a look at the storm outside
      the cave as he listened to the voice yelling his name. It sounded like a
      sad girl who was calling for her loved one.
    </p>
    <p>
      “The thing outside seems to be targeting you. You don’t need to go out
      there. I’ve lived here for years, and I have my way with the storm. Just
      wait for me here,” Lin Feng said as he walked out.
    </p>
    <p>
      Han Sen didn’t stop Lin Feng this time. He said to Little Silver and
      Little Star, “You guys stay here. I’ll go out with Lin Feng and check.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Teacher, the thing outside seems to know you. How about I go out there
      with you? I’m a spirit, so even if I die, I can still be resurrected,”
      said Xu Mi.
    </p>
    <p>
      “No need,” Han Sen called over his shoulder as he left the cave. He opened
      the umbrella in his hand, sheltering himself and Lin Feng from the wind
      and sand.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lin Feng nodded his thanks to Han Sen. He asked, “Where did you find that
      ring?”
    </p>
    <p>
      The storm outside was so strong that they couldn’t see or feel anything.
      There were no visible landmarks to use as reference points in the storm,
      so they simply needed to pick a direction to walk.
    </p>
    <p>“Where did you find the ring, Bao’er?” Han Sen looked to Bao’er.</p>
    <p>
      Bao’er was lying lazily on Han Sen’s shoulder. She lifted a finger to
      point out into the storm.
    </p>
    <p>
      She only picked up that ring because she thought it was pretty. However,
      she knew that she wouldn’t be getting the ring back now, so she had lost
      her motivation.
    </p>
    <p>
      Both Han Sen and Lin Feng were a little shocked at the direction Bao’er
      was pointing; she was pointing toward the voice in the storm.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Let’s go and check.” Han Sen walked forward with the umbrella in his
      hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      Neither of them said anything. They walked forward in the storm. The
      farther forward they moved, the stronger the storm became. The pressure on
      their hands became heavier and heavier.
    </p>
    <p>
      Fortunately, Han Sen’s body was pretty good, so the pressure didn’t crush
      him. As they walked, the voice calling to Han Sen became clearer and
      clearer. It was creepy.
    </p>
    <p>
      Suddenly, Lin Feng felt that he kicked something. He bent down to touch
      it, and then he pulled an iron arrow from the sand.
    </p>
    <p>
      “This is Jiwu’s arrow. There’s his mark on the shaft.” Lin Feng looked
      much more worried than before.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Let’s just walk forward. Perhaps he’s right in front of us. He might be
      trapped by something,” said Han Sen.
    </p>
    <p>
      The two kept walking, and they kept finding random things along the way.
      Based on Lin Feng’s speculation, and they all belonged to Jing Jiwu.
    </p>
    <p>
      They were both very worried as they realized that Jing Jiwu might be in
      great danger. However, they couldn’t do anything more than keep walking,
      hoping that they could still save Jing Jiwu.
    </p>
    <p>
      Suddenly, the storm in front of them weakened, and they could finally see
      something clear instead of complete darkness in front of them.
    </p>
    <p>
      Han Sen and Lin Feng saw clearly what was going on in front of them, and
      their eyes turned red.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a giant skeleton in front of them, and it was more than a
      hundred feet tall and a thousand feet long. It blocked most of the wind
      and sand, which was why the storm was weaker here than elsewhere.
    </p>
    <p>
      However, there was also a human being hanging from the skeleton. It was
      Jing Jiwu.
    </p>
    <p>
      At this moment, Jing Ji Wu was crucified upon the skeleton. His arms and
      feet were bleeding, and his eyes were also nailed to the skeleton. He
      couldn’t look more dead.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Jiwu!” Lin Feng looked at Jing Jiwu who was nailed to the skeleton. His
      face darkened, and he clenched his fist hard, driving his nails into his
      palm.
    </p>
    <p>
      However, Lin Feng didn’t take one step forward. Instead, he held out an
      arm and stopped Han Sen from lowering the body down.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Something’s wrong here. Someone’s trying to lure us over there to ambush
      us.” Lin Feng said each word quietly, but his voice was trembling. It
      wasn’t because he was scared, but because he was furious.
    </p>
    <p>
      “I know, but the only way to lure our enemies out is for us to go in.” Han
      Sen was also enraged. It didn’t feel good to see that someone he knew had
      died so tragically.
    </p>
    <p>“Are you sure?” Lin Feng asked, staring at Han Sen.</p>
    <p>
      “There are few in the Fourth God’s Sanctuary who can kill me,” answered
      Han Sen.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Okay, let’s go. Let’s go bring back Jiwu’s body,” Lin Feng said while
      taking large steps toward the skeleton.
    </p>
    <p>Han Sen lifted his Bulwark Umbrella and followed.</p>
    <p>
      Though Han Sen and Lin Feng couldn’t see them, a man and a woman were
      standing somewhere close to the skeleton, in a place wasn’t affected by
      the storm at all.
    </p>
    <p>That man looked normal, like an elegant middle-aged man.</p>
    <p>
      However, the woman looked quite unique. Her upper body was that of a
      woman, but her lower body looked like a centipede, and it was constituted
      with bones and barbs. Apparently, she was a creature.
    </p>
    <p>“They were tricked.” The women’s eyes gleamed.</p>
    <p>
      “Blood Bone Demon, are you sure you can kill him?” asked the man as he
      looked at that strange woman.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Rest assured, Mr. Qing Ya, I’ll definitely kill him for the Chairman.
      This is Feng Ge desert, and this place belongs to me.” Blood Bone Demon
      smiled weirdly. “As long as they touch my blood bone puppet, they’ll be
      doomed. Even God won’t be able to help them.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Good. As long as you kill Han Sen, the Chairman will always remember your
      contribution,” said Qing Ya mildly. He was staring at Han Sen and Lin
      Feng, who were approaching the skeleton.
    </p>
    <p>
      Blood Bone Demon’s eyes gleamed, and she licked her lips using her
      snake-like tongue. She was looking at Han Sen as if looking at a dead man.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Watch my back as I lower Jiwu’s body,” Lin Feng said as he flew to the
      skeleton. He summoned a beast soul sword, cutting the bones behind Jing
      Jiwu, and he caught Jing Jiwu’s body as it fell.
    </p>
    <p>
      However, just as Lin Feng touched Jing Jiwu’s body, Jing Jiwu’s eyes
      popped open, and its body wound around Lin Feng like a group of snakes.
    </p>
    <p>
      And then, bones emerged from Jing Jiwu’s body and locked around Lin Feng
      like an exoskeleton.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jing Jiwu’s corpse had been completely twisted, and it looked like a
      skeleton with lots of blood and flesh.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lin Feng under the skeleton’s control, and he couldn’t help slashing
      wildly toward Han Sen. Both of them were terrified.
