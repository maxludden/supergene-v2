  Han Sen didn’t turn back. He moved the severely damaged shield to cover his back, and at the same time, he slapped the Sacred egg with his left hand.

Two noises echoed at the same time. The Destroyer Wolf left three deep scars on the shield with its claws, piercing almost all the way through the shield.

However, unlike what Han Sen had expected, that Sacred egg didn’t exert any magnetic force on him, but it didn’t separate from the Rolling Dragon King and black dragon either. Instead, the Sacred egg, Rolling Dragon King, and the black dragon all spun away at the same time.

The three of them fell into the black pond. They sank, splashing the dark water everywhere.

The Destroyer Wolf was surprised when it saw that Han Sen wasn’t drawn towards the Sacred egg. Then it roared and dashed toward Han Sen again.

Han Sen dodged it while trying to think of a method to defend himself against the Destroyer Wolf, but nothing came to mind.

“I have to resort to Destiny’s Tower now.” Han Sen knew that if he kept doing this, he would be killed before too long. The best chance for him to survive was to use his Blood Legion technique and his Destiny’s Tower before too much of his energy was consumed.

Before Han Sen could activate the technique, the water in the black pond suddenly surged upwards. A terrifying force rushed out of the black pond.

The Destroyer Wolf and Han Sen both dodged away from the splashing black pond water. At the same time, they looked at the black pond, trying to figure out what was going on.

A stream of black light rose from the black pond like the sun escaping an eclipse, and then the light floated on the water.

That terrifying force came from the stream of black light, and the entire cave was covered by the sensation of death. The black light gradually withdrew, but the force of death became stronger and stronger. After the light went away, Han Sen missed a heartbeat after seeing what emerged.

A beautiful woman walked out of the black pond. She was wearing black armor and carrying a long black bow. She had a pair of black wings like that of a crow, and her hair was dark like ink while her eyes were deep like an abyss. Her entire body emanated a beautiful yet ferocious force, as if she were an angel descending into hell.

“It has finally incubated!” The Destroyer Wolf’s eyes were glinting like crazy. It stopped fighting Han Sen and rushed toward the female just hatched from the Sacred egg.

Han Sen didn’t move towards the egg. It wasn’t because he was afraid that he couldn’t defeat Destroyer Wolf, but that the force of death coming from that woman was too horrifying.

To Han Sen, the woman was more terrifying than Destroyer Wolf. Perhaps the Destroyer Wolf had already prepared itself enough that it thought it could gain something from the woman, but as for Han Sen, he didn’t think he could gain any power from her.

That woman was floating above the black pond. Though she had her eyes open, her eyes looked hollow, as if she didn’t have any soul.

The Destroyer Wolf opened its mouth wide, and it bit the woman’s neck with its barb-like fangs. Those white teeth were actually hollow inside. As they bit into the woman’s neck, the blood filled the wolf’s teeth, dyeing them black.

The woman’s blood was actually black, which made Destroyer Wolf more excited. It bit deeper and harder into her neck so that it could absorb the power faster.

The female seemed to have felt the pain. She frowned, and some sort of thought finally appeared to cross her dark eyes.

“More… I want more… I want the most perfect and the most powerful genes…” The Destroyer Wolf sucked as it roared crazily.

The woman’s body seemed to be very sturdy. The wolf’s teeth could only go a little bit deeper, and the harder it bit, the more difficult it was.

However, the black blood kept flooding into the fangs of Destroyer Wolf, and at the same time, black smoke drifted out of its white wolf fur. Its body seemed to be going through some changes.

Han Sen was surprised. Humans, creatures, or even spirits could evolve by eating the flesh and blood of creatures. However, while eating creature-flesh could strengthen one’s genes, the genes of the original body would always be the foundation.

The changes Destroyer Wolf was experiencing were a bit different. Its body seemed to have accepted the foreign genes completely, and its body was going through some changes that shouldn’t have happened.

The black smoke from the Destroyer Wolf was getting denser and denser, and its originally white fur had turned completely dark. The flesh on its back was twisted as if something was about to extend from its spine.

Han Sen didn’t know what to do.

He thought that a terrifying being like that woman would’ve fought the Destroyer Wolf to the death, yet she wasn’t reacting at all. Instead, she was just standing there, letting the Destroyer Wolf suck her blood.

As the Destroyer Wolf drank her blood, its power became much stronger.

Though the woman’s facial expression changed a little bit, she was still floating there without any actual reactions. After such a long time, her blood must have been almost completely drained, and now it was too late for her to react.

“Though she looks like Goddess, she’s only a newborn, after all. She might not have enough intelligence to know what’s happening,” Han Sen thought.

After a short while, the flesh on Destroyer Wolf’s back exploded, and blood splashed everywhere. A pair of bloody wings extended.

The wings looked raw and bloody, as fur was still growing across them. However, the wings were growing fast, and they darkened until they resembled the woman’s wings.

“Power… Strong power… Fascinating…” Destroyer Wolf was greedy, and it kept sucking until it drained all of the woman’s blood. After that, it took out its teeth and roared at the sky.

Its body was covered with black fire emanating the force of death, and its wings spread wide behind it. As it roared, its black wings gave off the feeling of death as well.

As for the woman who had been sucked dry, she fell to the floor of the cave like a lifeless puppet. Her eyes were still open like black holes, but there wasn’t any lifeforce in her. Perhaps she was dead already.

Han Sen sighed and rushed toward the water on top of the cave. He had completely lost his chance already. Destroyer Wolf had finished merging, and it was more powerful than ever. Even its previous power had been terrifying. Han Sen’s blood legion technique could only last for a while, so he didn’t want to risk anything before he was sure that he could defeat Destroyer Wolf in a short period of time.

“Do you want to go?” Destroyer Wolf sneered, shook its wings, and shot toward Han Sen with its terrifying force of death.
