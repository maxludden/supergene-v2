<p>Even the Knife Blank has come out. Is it useful?” Han Sen waved
the Knife Blank. It felt good to wield, but it didn’t seem to</p>
<p>possess any strange powers.</p>
<p>Black Steel looked at the Knife Blank and said, “It fell down
like that without fear, so it is indeed something special. It will
be a King class if it can become a real knife.”</p>
<p>After that, Black Steel ignored Han Sen. He went towards the
knife mountain in search of another knife.</p>
<p>“It sounds really good. How might I complete it, then? Your
family is one of blacksmiths, right? Couldn’t you help me forge
it?” Han Sen asked Black Steel.</p>
<p>“This is a knife growing in Knife Grave. It has life. It isn’t a
simple material I can use for forging. I can’t do that,” Black
Steel answered.</p>
<p>Ever since the twelfth rain fell, the Knife Grave had stopped
erupting. There were no more knife rains as a result.</p>
<p>Black Steel scaled the mountain, and he searched for over six
hours. Finally, he found the King class weapon he had been looking
for.</p>
<p>As they fervently searched on the inside, the people on the
outside grew increasingly worried. This was especially true of
Black Steel’s father, Black-Moon King. Black Steel had been overdue
by many hours, and he still hadn’t come out. It made</p>
<p>Black-Moon King’s forehead sweat profusely.</p>
<p>“I am afraid they will be unable to return. At this time, a
fifteenth rain will have come. At that strength, not even a Duke
would stand a chance of repelling it”</p>
<p>“They were too greedy. They should have come out by now.”</p>
<p>“Poor Black-Moon King. He only has one son.”</p>
<p>As everyone discussed the matter, a white light emerged from the
pit of the black hole. Two people soon came out, shocking everyone
there.</p>
<p>It was Han Sen and Black Steel. Black-Moon King was made
incredibly happy, but only for a single second. Then, so coldly, he
asked, “Why are you only conning out now? What did you get?”</p>
<p>Black Steel and Han Sen were shocked to see so many people had
been waiting on them. Black Steel heard Black-Moon King’s question,
and so he brought out his new weapon, drew it, and presented it to
him. He said, “Please take a look, Father.”</p>
<p>When Black-Moon King saw the knife, he froze. He didn’t pick it
up, and he had to try to contain his excitement. With forced
calmness, he said, “This is your knife. Activate it yourself.”</p>
<p>“Yes.” Black Steel spoke with respect, and then he inserted his
power into it.</p>
<p>The knife Black Steel had brought out looked a little weird. It
had been made of bone, from the looks of it. The body of the blade
was very straight, but also four feet long. The width of the blade
was greater than a man’s hand.</p>
<p>Black Steel held it with both of his hands. He put his Baron
power inside of it, and then the bone knife roared the roar of a
dragon.</p>
<p>And then, swordlight flashed across the sky like a dragon in
flight. It roared and zoomed around.</p>
<p>Buzz! Buzz!</p>
<p>Everyone present, who was carrying a knife, looked down as their
weapons made strange noises. All the other knives were responding
to the bone knife.</p>
<p>“King class knife?” Everyone was shocked, and Black-Moon King
laughed out loud.</p>
<p>His son had found a King class weapon. In all the time the
Rebate had controlled Narrow Moon, such an event had never
occurred.</p>
<p>Throughout all those years, with many Rebate and many different
races, so many talented people had gone there. And yet, none had
ever emerged with a King class weapon. But this time, it had
happened. Black-Moon King’s son had done it, and that weapon had
accepted his son as its rightful bearer. Black Steel was weak, and
he couldn’t use the weapon’s true strength, but as he grew up, it
would adjust. They would grow and become more accustomed to one
another, until one day, all of its power could be unleashed.</p>
<p>This was something so many people could only ever dream of
accomplishing. Black-Moon King wanted to laugh his head off. He was
thinking he’d dream of laughing, too.</p>
<p>“Black Steel, what will you name it?” Black-Moon King asked with
a smile.</p>
<p>“I would like to name it Dragon’s Back,” Black Steel said, as he
sheathed the weapon.</p>
<p>“Dragon’s Back. Good. Good. Good. Ha! Ha!” Black-Moon King said
good three times, and then laughed.</p>
<p>“Black-Moon King, congratulations!” Many other Kings
congratulated Black-Moon King.</p>
<p>Bringing out a King class weapon, and then getting approved by
it, was a grand achievement. It was a big thing for Black- Moon
King, and it looked like Black Steel could be a candidate for
becoming the master of the Eleventh Star.</p>
<p>Even Moon-Wheel King and Yisha nodded. Black Steel’s luck and
growth were good for the future of the Rebate.</p>
<p>After a while, people realized another person had emerged from
the tunnel.</p>
<p>Black-Moon King was in a good mood, and so he smiled at Han Sen
and said, “Han Sen, what did you bring with you? Let us take a
look.”</p>
<p>Everyone looked at Han Sen. He and Black Steel had come out
together, so there was a chance he had gotten a King class weapon,
as well. The chance of that happening would be slim, though. You
would need much luck and travel to find one. You couldn’t get it by
just standing there. But the longer you stayed in that land, the
higher the chance you would have of being able to find one.</p>
<p>Han Sen didn’t deny what he had earned. He was going to draw it
out, as it was a requirement for everyone’s weapon to be
registered. Hiding it would be pointless.</p>
<p>But as he clutched the handle, he felt as if something was
wrong.</p>
<p>The Knife Blank had been like steel. It was really rough, and it
felt as if Han Sen was clutching a coarse rod. But the handle Han
Sen grabbed now was very delicate. It was like the tusk of an
elephant It did not feel like the Knife Blank it had been
earlier.</p>
<p>Han Sen frowned and drew it out. It was not the Knife Blank he
had seen earlier.</p>
<p>The knife he was holding gave off a purple mist. It was a
scimitar, and it looked like the fang of a devil. The knife looked
as if it was something made from solidified bad luck. It looked
like your blood would be drained by that knife.</p>
<p>Han Sen turned around and looked. The knife was still on his
back. He felt weird and thought, “Oh no! Why is there another
knife? Where did this come from? I thought people said only one
knife could be carried out. If I knew I could bring more than one,
I’d have brought enough for my Mom, Wife, Son, Sister, Grandson,
Little Angel, and Xie Qing.”</p>
<p>Seeing Han Sen’s knife, Black-Moon King’s expression became
strange. He said, “Han Sen, see if you can activate this
power.”</p>
<p>Han Sen nodded, and then he put his strength into the
devil-looking fang.</p>
