  Back at the shelter, Han Sen had the time to examine the Destroyer Wolf beast soul.

Berserk Super Beast Soul Destroyer Wolf: Charm-type

Han Sen saw this and was quite surprised. He didn’t know what a charm beast soul was; he had never heard of it before.

Han Sen summoned the Destroyer Wolf next, to examine what the charm beast soul could do.

Destroyer Wolf flew out from the Sea of Soul and became a charm that was about the same size as Han Sen’s palm.

The charm was pitch-black in color, and it was engraved with the depiction of a wolf with wings. It looked just like Destroyer Wolf itself did, after it evolved.

Han Sen looked at the charm a few times. He felt a deathly aura and residual space powers entwining all around it. It was a scary little thing, and he didn’t have a clue how it worked.

Han Sen spent the next few days researching it, and when he discovered what its purpose was, he was delighted.

Charm-type beast souls were special, and much of the information Han Sen uncovered was from the Alliance. He read on Skynet about a person who had come into possession of a charm-type beast soul. The person said he had figured out how to use it, and the post he had made was basically just the man showing off.

But at least it was informative enough to teach Han Sen how to use it. Charm beast souls could resurrect dead creatures. The resurrected creature would then adhere to the charm, and the charm explicitly. Not the person who operated it.

When the charm was placed on someone, the creature you summoned would follow that person until death.

It did not matter if the target was living or dead, but the charm would be destroyed. And that meant the charm beast soul was a single-use item. At least it was a strong one.

Destroyer Wolf was a mighty foe. Even if Han Sen chose a target that had a super creature for protection, they’d be easily slain.

There was one downside to the item, however; he could only use it once. Han Sen wouldn’t want to use it until it was a proper life or death moment.

The person he read about must have used the charm beast soul to discover its purpose, as before that, there was no such information in the Alliance. Not many people believed the post, though, and many people thought it was a straight-up lie.

With nothing else to do, Han Sen went to the geno core storage. He received many invitations to battle, and one repeated challenge was from Ghost Eye.

“That kid dares challenge me again? Has he finally given up on living?” Han Sen accepted the challenge, wondering what the pest wanted this time.

The moment Han Sen stepped into the battleground, Ghost Eye began shouting. “Congratulations on unsealing Blow Blood geno core. Now you know I wasn’t lying, eh?”

“Congratulations for what? I sold it off, because I wasn’t able to unseal it, either. There’s no use congratulating me,” Han Sen said coldly.

Ghost Eye looked shocked. “Are you joking? You are Dollar, surely.”

“If I was Dollar, I wouldn’t waste my breath with talk. I’d just kill you.” Han Sen put on his annoyed face, and then went on to say, “Say your piece or get lost.”

Ghost Eye stared at Han Sen, unsure if he was telling the truth. But he didn’t dare continue pestering him. So, he said, “Boss, about that other thing. I want to buy your first place rank. Name your price, and I’ll meet the demand if I can.”

“Okay, one super geno core,” Han Sen said.

“Boss, I only have a silver geno core. How am I supposed to obtain a super geno core? I gave you my emperor geno core, didn’t I? That was my only one.” Ghost Eye looked bitter, but on the inside, he was thinking, “You are evil. You want to trade a super geno core for the first rank on the silver geno core leaderboard. Do you think that is something someone can get on a whim?”

“Who is to know the broken thing you gave me was an emperor geno core? I sold it like the junk I thought it was. It makes me mad that you didn’t tell me how powerful it might have been. You should have told me sooner, as now I have lost it,” Han Sen said menacingly.

Ghost Eye was enraged, but he didn’t dare argue. So, he said, “Boss, didn’t I tell you a few times? You just didn’t believe me.”

“Fine. I will forget about that. So, do you want to buy it once or buy it off?” Han Sen looked at Ghost Eye as he spoke.

“What does buying it once or buying it off mean?”

“Buying it once adheres to the rules of our first deal. You rent it temporarily, and when you’re done, you give it back to me. If you buy it off completely, you’re purchasing permanent ownership. Then, I won’t expect you to return it.”

“What are the prices for each package? Once and off?” Ghost Eye asked.

“Buying it once will cost you a gemstone geno core. If you buy it off, it’s that price times ten,” Han Sen said.

Ghost Eye thought to himself, “He must think I’m crazy! Of course I’ll just buy it once, because he can’t guarantee the return or do anything to me, anyway. I was fine even after I didn’t return it the last time.”

“Boss, I would like to buy it once,” Ghost Eye said politely.

“Okay, but if you buy it once, we’re going to have to hammer out a contract.” Han Sen smiled.

“What contract?” Ghost Eye asked.

“If you buy my first place and do not give me the first rank back, you have to reimburse me with ten super geno cores. This will be inked onto a contract as proof.” Han Sen smiled.

“Okay, I’ll sign it. I’ll give it back. Put faith in me this second time.” Ghost Eye was very happy, and he thought to himself, “What is the point of making a contract? He can’t find me in Hell Shelter. He won’t be able to find its location, and even if he did, he wouldn’t dare come.”

“Then let’s make the contract.” Han Sen pulled out a pen and paper. Then, Ghost Eye wrote down the words Han Sen asked him to write. Then, he placed a paw print on it.

“Boss, how’s this?” Ghost Eye returned the contract to Han Sen, alongside a sacred-blood geno core.

Han Sen reviewed the contract, folded it up, and said, “Okay, now you are first.”

Han Sen conceded and left the geno battleground. Then, he challenged Ghost Eye again.

Ghost Eye saw Han Sen’s challenge request, but ignored it. Then he said, “Pah, so naive. Who would return it to you? I am going to sell this first rank before anything else happens.”

Han Sen knew Ghost Eye wouldn’t be honest, though. He didn’t mind selling it for a sacred-blood geno core, as the contract might pay dividends further down the line.

Han Sen wasn’t going to let Ghost Eye off the hook, either. He left the geno core storage and leveled his Crystal Core up to gold. Then, he returned to the geno core storage with Bulwark Umbrella.
