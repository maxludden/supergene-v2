<h3>Chapter 2297</h3>

<p>As the white whale left the Ice Blue system, Han Sen guided it
towards where Night River King had been stationed. He was unable to
find anything out of the ordinary there, however, and he couldn’t
find a single trace of that weird purple stuff that Night River
King had mentioned repeatedly.</p>
<p>Han Sen even went to see the Ice Blue Knight who had taken over
Night River King’s position, but the knight hadn’t seen anything
strange during his time stationed there.</p>
<p>“Weird. What was that purple thing Night River King was talking
about? What about the journal entries he made in code?” Han Sen
didn’t understand, but he didn’t plan on lingering in the system to
figure it out, either.</p>
<p>Han Sen turned the white whale out of the system, plotting a
course back to Narrow Moon. He didn’t see Under Overbearing again,
and neither did he see the Black Hole Spider. They did encounter
many more of those Galactic Shrimp. The attacks of the shrimp were
unable to penetrate the defenses of the white whale, though. And
added to that, none of the creatures were as fast as the white
whale. Having a powerful ship like the white whale ensured their
safety as they traveled, assuming that they only ran into ordinary
xenogeneics like the Galactic Shrimp. If they got into trouble, it
would be because they bumped into a creature like Under Overbearing
or the Black Hole Spider. Of course, even if that happened, they
had the deified elite Yisha on board.</p>
<p>They had good luck in their travels. Yisha and Han Sen were able
to depart the systems of chaos with absolute safety. They would
soon be back in Narrow Moon.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>“Dude, what happened? Why has every noble across every planet
been ordered to go to Full Moon Hall?”</p>
<p>“Haven’t you heard? Knife Queen is back!”</p>
<p>“Knife Queen is back? How is that possible? I thought she died
in the systems of chaos.”</p>
<p>“That’s what all the nobles thought, too. That’s why they
plundered her legacy inventory without fear. But she has really
come back, and not just that; she’s come back deified.”</p>
<p>“What? Queen has become deified? This is awesome! We Rebate
finally have a deified elite in our ranks. Who would dare
underestimate us now? Queen is way too powerful.”</p>
<p>“Teehee! It might be good for us, but what about the nobles who
divided up her things? They stole her legacy and crushed her
student Han Sen under their feet. Now that she has come back
deified, they must be shivering in their boots.”</p>
<p>“They had it coming. They think they’re so high and mighty,
bullying a student.”</p>
<p>“I’m happy that those nobles are going to get told off. They
always bully us, don’t they? And we can never fight back! Now that
they are in trouble… Well, it’s what they deserve.”</p>
<p>As Narrow Moon’s people were discussing Knife Queen’s return, a
serious discussion was being held in Full Moon Hall.</p>
<p>“No, absolutely not! Miss Knife… Han Sen is just an outsider! He
does not have what it takes to be our Holy Child,” an elder said,
shaking his head forcefully.</p>
<p>Flower King said, “Knife… Miss… Don’t you think that this is a
little inappropriate? The Holy Child has always been the best and
most promising of the Rebate. Han Sen isn’t even one of our kind.
Even if we force him to become our Holy Child, the rest of our
citizens will vehemently object to the selection.”</p>
<p>“Miss Knife, please think about this!” Black Moon King liked Han
Sen, but even he did not think that this was right. They risked
angering their entire race.</p>
<p>All the nobles were arguing against Yisha’s decision to elect
Han Sen as the Holy Child. Full Moon Hall was filled with so many
shouting voices that it was louder than a supermarket.</p>
<p>Moon Wheel King raised his hand to tell everyone to quiet down.
Then, he looked at Yisha and said, “Knife, we were not considerate
to you and Han Sen in your absence. We can give him whatever he
deserves, but the position of Holy Child is something of gross
importance. It affects the very legacy and glory of our race.
Allowing an outsider to take this position is in no way
appropriate. You must think about this decision some more.”</p>
<p>“Are you guys done?” Yisha sat at the head of the conference
table. She coldly looked upon all of the nobles that had gathered
there.</p>
<p>All of those nobles felt a massive chill as her eyes came to
stare at each of them in turn. They fell utterly silent under the
weight of her gaze. The same was true for Flower King, as it was
all the others.</p>
<p>After everyone stopped talking, Yisha spoke in a slow,
deliberate voice. “What if I insist that Han Sen becomes our Holy
Child?”</p>
<p>“Knife Queen, if you… if you insist, then you’ll have to forgive
us for being unreasonable. The elders will never agree to this
notion, and I am sure none of the kings here in Full Moon Hall
agree to it, either.” The members of the Council of Elders kept
trying to convince her. “Knife Queen! We are objecting to your plan
in order to preserve the legacy and glory of the Rebate. We cannot
allow everything we have built for the Rebate to be destroyed.”</p>
<p>“Are you saying I am destroying the Rebate as a whole?” Yisha
asked coldly.</p>
<p>“Knife Queen, that is not what we meant…” The elder wanted to
say more, but Yisha cut him off.</p>
<p>Yisha swept her gaze across the nobles and stopped at Moon Wheel
King. “I called you all here to tell you of the decision I have
made. I did not call you here for you to voice your opinions on the
matter. Starting from today, Han Sen is the Holy Child of the
Rebate. If you have a problem with the decision, let me hear it
now.”</p>
<p>Many of the nobles were frozen. Although they objected, no one
wished to square-off against Yisha. They all looked at Moon Wheel
King.</p>
<p>Moon Wheel King frowned and looked at Yisha. “What if we all
object at once?”</p>
<p>Yisha laughed. She stood up, ignoring Moon Wheel King. She
looked down upon all of the nobles and slowly said, “Listen up,
people! From now on, Narrow Moon is my Narrow Moon. The Rebate have
only one queen. Whoever follows me will live, but anyone who seeks
to betray me will die. You can object, but if you directly disobey
one of my commands, I will consider you an enemy. I do not mind an
injection of fresh blood to fill up the ranks of Narrow Moon.”</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>Over the next few months, political instability swept through
the Rebate. The people in power kept changing, and families rose
and fell on a daily basis.</p>
<p>Han Sen really admired Yisha’s decisiveness. Once she made her
mind up, she took sole control of Rebate society without looking
back.</p>
<p>She’d lacked the strength to make such a bold power-grab before,
but now that she was deified, she could suppress anyone who rose
against her. She ruled single-handedly, which allowed complicated
issues to get resolved much faster.</p>
<p>But other problems began to appear. There were many different
factions within Rebate society, and no one could say for certain if
Yisha would be able to unite the fragmented society while
maintaining her dictatorship.</p>
<p>Some issues could not be solved through power alone. Claiming
the throne had been Yisha’s first step, but there was a long road
ahead of her.</p>
<p>Han Sen was confident in Yisha, but he honestly didn’t pay much
attention to the political turmoil of the Rebate. He was busy
investigating the information given to him by Mister White.</p>
<p>The techniques of the Xuan Men were very deep. There was a great
deal of information to sift through, which included more than just
a few geno arts. Some of what Han Sen read would take a few hundred
years to truly comprehend.</p>
