  Aside from the knights guarding outside the planet, the misters and gene casters that had ventured onto the planet were all dead. It was very scary. The other Sky Wing Knights were starting to flee. Bald Guy, Han Sen, and Li Bing Yu were completely shocked. That planet had become weird and brutal. The many powerful gene casters on it could have teleported away in under a second, yet they had been unable to escape the vines ensnaring them. Once they were pulled into the lava, no matter how strong the gene casters were, they all ended up dead.

“God Spirit Blood-Pulse… That planet must contain a God Spirit Blood – Pulse…” Bald Guy looked at the planet that now shone like a sun.

“Are you going to tell me the old vine is a God Spirit Blood-Pulse?” Han Sen frowned.

“Of course, that is not a God Spirit Blood-Pulse. If I have guessed correctly, the old vine must be the gene race that lives on the planet. When the God Spirit Blood-Pulse formed there, the old vine gene race absorbed the land pulse’s gene eggs to evolve. The scariest thing about it is that the element suits the God Spirit Blood-Pulse. It must have a God Spirit Blood-Pulse buff, which is what makes it so terrifying.”

Bald Guy paused for a moment and then said, “Let’s not incite its ire for now. The people from Sky King won’t stop, so let them try and find out just how powerful the old vine gene race is.”

There was something Bald Guy had not said. There was a scary God Spirit Blood-Pulse there, and Sky King might end up going there himself. Since Sky King had created so much trouble there, other elites were also likely going to show up. If they were to go for the land pulse now, there was far too much risk.

“Can you determine the location of that God Spirit Blood-Pulse?” Han Sen asked as he looked at Bald Guy.

He knew Bald Guy’s hesitation, but he was thinking differently than Bald Guy. Han Sen thought this was a good opportunity. Since other elites had yet to show up, now was the prime time for him to nab a God Spirit Blood-Pulse.

“Do you want to get a God Spirit Blood-Pulse?” Bald Guy knew what Han Sen was thinking

“Do you know where it is?” Han Sen asked for confirmation. Bald Guy gnashed his teeth and said to Han Sen, “If I am correct, the God Spirit Blood-Pulse should be at the core. People from Sky King must have just dug the core and triggered the God Spirit Blood-Pulse, which immediately wreaked havoc across the planet. If this was a normal situation, we would have to find where they dug. Now, we do not have to go to such trouble. The entire planet has become liquid. You just need to be able to withstand the frightening temperature. If you do that and can access the core, you will find the God Spirit Blood-Pulse.”

After pausing, Bald Guy added, “If you do want to fight for it, it is best that you hurry. The God Spirit Blood-Pulse has not completely blown up yet. When it does explode, there will be many weird scenes that will shock the world. It will attract countless elites. I am afraid if you get the God Spirit Blood-Pulse, you will not be able to escape.” “OK. You guys wait somewhere far away. Once I have the God Spirit Blood-Pulse, I will come and find you.” After saying that, Han Sen flapped his peacock wings. He turned into a gold light and flew toward the planet that looked like a sun.

Li Bing Yu looked as if she was wrestling with her thoughts. She knew more than Bald Guy. That planet’s core had created a very scary God Spirit Blood-Pulse. It was unlike any other God Spirit Blood-Pulse. A person had to have a very high level of fitness to accept that God Spirit Blood-Pulse.

Now, the planet had another old vine gene race to guard it. Li Bing Yu recognized the old vine gene race. In Wu Wei Dao Palace, it was recorded as a rare ancient gene race called a sun spirit gourd. It was a fire and yang gene race.

The sun spirit gourd must have hatched inside the core because its lifecycle was so long. It was unknown how long it had been growing inside the core. It had not shown up above the ground, and no human had been able to detect it before all of this.

Because the land’s magnetic field had changed, the Gold Crystal System harbored a super god pulse. That planet had come to look like gold starlight, one of the seven key points. It created an incredibly scary God Spirit Blood-Pulse and many gene eggs. That God Spirit Blood-Pulse was a fire element being with yang

The sun spirit gourd, which required a billion years to evolve, had absorbed a lot of gene eggs and earned the buff of a God Spirit Blood-Pulse. It was in ultimate mode.

Thinking about the ultimate mode of the rare sun spirit gourd with its scary God Spirit Blood-Pulse buff, it was hard for her to imagine how strong it was.

No matter how strong Han Sen was, it would have been hard for anyone to survive wherever the sun spirit gourd inhabited. She was hesitant about telling Han Sen any of that.

Han Sen moved too swiftly. He did not give Li Bing Yu time to think about her decision. Li Bing Yu called after Han Sen, but he did not hear her. He rushed into the sun-like planet.

“Never mind. With his power, maybe he can emerge from there alive,” Li Bing Yu said with a sigh. She did not know what to think.

Han Sen jumped into the burning hot lava. Rather, it was not considered lava anymore. Due to the high temperature, it had become some sort of weird fluid. Even metal and stone were like crystal-clear water.

Although the gold wing peacock king offered protection, Han Sen still felt very hot. Fortunately, his body was strong, and he was not afraid of the heat. He picked a place far away from the old vine to fly.

The deeper into the core he went, the hotter it became. To Han Sen, this was no big deal. His eyes shone with a weird gold light. He shot through the scary, high-temperature liquid. His god powers reached a thousand miles.

This was the god wing peacock king’s combine gene skill peacock king eye. If he did not have that power, Han Sen would not have been able to see any further than 30 feet ahead.

While he was flying, a dragon-like shadow started coming toward him from the lava. It was suddenly in front of Han Sen. It was a giant vine bigger than a water tank. It was larger than the old vine outside.

Han Sen was ready. He knew the old vine had been created from the core. Whatever was hidden underneath must have been the source of it all.

Han Sen did not think about that. The old vine covered the entire core. His gold god wings flapped. Behind Han Sen, the peacock wings shone with gold light. His entire body became a gold light moving toward the vine.

Dong!

The indestructible gold god wing left a light mark on the old vine. The old vine was still madly going for Han Sen.

The gold god wings flapped again. He dodged the old vine’s attack. In the next second, a few more vines appeared. They came at him from several different directions. The vines were like dragons. They were like sea dragons. Han Sen was like a flying peacock. He flew elegantly and fast. He dodged one old vine while another old vine tried to stop him. He went straight toward the core.

Although many geno arts were not available for him to use, he was very good at judgment and formation. These were talents that could be used anytime.

Amid the countless numbers of vines trying to strike him down, he was still able to swiftly make his way to the core. He was almost unstoppable.
