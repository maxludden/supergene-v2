      If someone was killed in a geno core fight, that meant one party was far
      too powerful. To kill the heir of a super creature so simply, and without
      fanfare, spoke volumes about the strength of the elusive owner of the
      Crystal Core.
    </p>
    <p>
      The babies of a super creature were stronger than their predecessors, and
      that held true for any species of creature. Still, their self geno cores
      were still tiered, starting off bronze and in need of reinforcement.
    </p>
    <p>
      The geno core that belonged to Black Mountain God had, despite being
      bronze, often been compared to the strength of a gold geno core that was
      usually possessed by a mutant creature. He had accomplished much with his
      Heart Wheel, and he had even been known to survive encounters with
      sacred-blood creatures that possessed gemstone geno cores.
    </p>
    <p>
      The fact he had now been vanquished by someone in the same tier as him was
      frightening. It was almost unheard of.
    </p>
    <p>
      Black Mountain God had been killed unceremoniously, and Sky Lord from
      Sacred Shelter eagerly wished to find out who had committed this atrocity.
      Unfortunately for all those who sought vengeance, the only person to have
      ever seen the person who possessed the Crystal Core was dead.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a subject that became much-discussed in the days ahead. Across the
      Fourth God’s Sanctuary, the topic of the fight and what manner of being
      could have conjured such a terrifying geno core was at the tip of
      everyone’s tongue.
    </p>
    <p>
      There were many guesses, too, of course. Most of them were aimed at
      presuming the owner of such a geno core was either the son of some emperor
      or the descendant of a berserk super creature. Not even Godslayer Luo
      possessed such fearsome power.
    </p>
    <p>
      Han Sen cared little for the gossip, though. And after that nifty trick
      with the egg, he had become enamored with it. Still, he could never get it
      to replicate what it had done. He couldn’t convince the skeleton to emerge
      like a bony pigmy from hell.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Does it need to be imbued with more power or something? Or does it need
      to be damaged sufficiently?” Han Sen stabbed a few guesses.
    </p>
    <p>
      If it did have to be broken, Han Sen wasn’t willing to break it himself.
      There was always the possibility the skeleton was growing, and the idea of
      prematurely awakening it didn’t bode well.
    </p>
    <p>
      So, Han Sen went off to research the Heart Wheel that had become encased
      in ice.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Heart Wheel was known to be a cruel circular blade, but it was a
      lifeless block of ice now, more than anything. It had been completely
      sealed, and with the pigmy having returned to the egg, its unsealing was a
      complete mystery to Han Sen.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Can the egg unseal it, perhaps?” Han Sen summoned his egg and placed it
      on the ice.
    </p>
    <p>
      It worked. The ice began to quickly thaw and melt away. Soon after, its
      gold sheen returned, and the weapon looked as mighty as it first did,
      gleaming in the desert sun.
    </p>
    <p>
      “The egg can soften things and the skeleton can harden things.
      Interesting,” Han Sen thought to himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      What had happened to the Heart Wheel was a shame, however. It was a
      remarkable geno core, but due to its master having been killed, it would
      remain as a bronze geno core for the rest of time.
    </p>
    <p>
      The fact that the bronze geno core of a super creature could compare to
      the power of a gold geno core was an astounding fact, which surprised Han
      Sen.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was even more of a shame that he most likely couldn’t make use of the
      Heart Wheel. Or at least, he couldn’t use it willy-nilly. It was a widely
      recognized geno core, and if people saw Han Sen in possession of it, it
      wouldn’t take much effort to put two and two together.
    </p>
    <p>
      So, Han Sen went to the spirit hall, and there, he found Red Pony and
      Starsea Beast drinking milk.
    </p>
    <p>
      Han Sen still did not know what manner of power the red pony possessed.
      And as for the Starsea Beast, it was too young to do much. The Starsea Orb
      it had possessed was only bronze.
    </p>
    <p>
      It soon began to dawn on Han Sen that he had no firepower. There was no
      proper muscle bolstering his ranks. Cheap Sheep could hardly even fight,
      and just went “baa” at the sight of someone stronger than he was.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Should I get Cheap Sheep to obey Sacred Shelter? Maybe I won’t even have
      to fight; through the misfortune that follows him, he’d bring it down
      without me having to do anything. The thing is a walking thundercloud,
      after all,” Han Sen mused, in half-jest.
    </p>
    <p>
      Even if he wanted to do that, Sacred Shelter was a grand distance away
      from where they were. Han Sen didn’t even know which direction it was in.
    </p>
    <p>
      With the sheep being as weak as he was, he’d probably be looked down upon,
      too. He’d make for a nice slice of mutton and little more, Han Sen
      ultimately figured.
    </p>
    <p>
      “When I finally do reach Sacred Shelter, I’ll make sure to bring Cheap
      Sheep. Maybe I can still work his curse on the wretched denizens of that
      place.” Han Sen entertained the idea and decided it was worth a shot. He
      could pull the sheep out of hot water if things didn’t go according to
      plan.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Hey, you two: do you know what it means to return a favor?” Han Sen
      directed his voice to Starsea Beast and Red Pony.
    </p>
    <p>
      Han Sen had planned to let them practice and train themselves in the
      safety of the shelter and land they occupied. Beginning training while
      they were young would yield the best results, after all.
    </p>
    <p>
      “As a creature, you need to get better. This current milk-drinking
      laziness is a shameful display. You need to chip-in and earn your bread,
      prove yourself valuable assets of the community and more. This requires
      hard work, that is true, but it is for the betterment of us all, and
      yourselves, most of all.”
    </p>
    <p>
      Han Sen then led them outside the shelter to slay a few primitive
      creatures so he could max out his geno point tally.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Little Red, go after that thing! Little Star, prepare to heal your
      milk-buddy. And heal him completely; I don’t want to see a single scar or
      scabbing left on him, okay?” While Han Sen was having fun being a coach,
      he heard the sound of fighting echoing in the distance. He turned to take
      a look in the direction it was coming from, and he found himself quite
      shocked.
