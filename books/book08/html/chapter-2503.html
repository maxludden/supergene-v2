<h2>Conspiracy?</h2>
<h3>Chapter 2503</h3>

<p>The Ice Blue Knights watched Han Sen through a camera, their
jaws clenched.</p>
<p>He was like a thief who had run into their house and beaten up
their son before proceeding to steal their possessions. After his
crimes, instead of running away, he had gone into the backyard for
a cup of tea. Wouldn’t that make anyone mad?</p>
<p>The worst part was that, in order to preserve Bai Wuchang’s
life, they had to refrain from doing anything to Han Sen. They had
to watch him go for a nice walk on the planet.</p>
<p>“What is he trying to do?” Ice Blue Knight King looked at Han
Sen. He couldn’t tell what Han Sen’s true purpose was in coming
here.</p>
<p>Considering the inherent danger in Han Sen’s situation, they all
thought it would be best if he left sooner rather than later. No
matter how strong Han Sen was, he couldn’t compete against deified
elites. If the Extreme King deifieds arrived, he would be in a lot
of danger.</p>
<p>But Han Sen wasn’t running. He was just bumbling around. His
actions made Ice Blue Knight King and the other higher-ups very
uncertain.</p>
<p>They sent a video of Han Sen to the Extreme King. The Extreme
King’s deified elites were very confused about his purpose there,
too. He didn’t know why Han Sen was choosing to hang around this
random planet. It was like he was just waiting there for them to
grab him.</p>
<p>“A conspiracy. There must be some sort of conspiracy…” Sixth
Uncle said, gritting his teeth.</p>
<p>They believed that Han Sen had some sort of plan that was about
to be exposed, but they weren’t sure what it was all about.
Everyone thought hard about what was going on, trying to guess what
Han Sen was trying to do. But there were too many possibilities. No
option seemed more likely than any of the others.</p>
<p>“Let Fourth Uncle and the others go quickly to the systems of
chaos. It doesn’t matter what Han Sen is planning; it won’t be a
threat to them,” King Bai said coldly.</p>
<p>His favorite son had been taken by Han Sen, but he didn’t appear
too worried. He looked as if nothing had happened, and he was
acting like his usual self.</p>
<p>“Father, I beg you to let me take some people to the systems of
chaos. We need to capture Han Sen and save Bai Wuchang,” the crown
prince bowed and pleaded.</p>
<p>He and Bai Wuchang came from the same mother, so he was closer
to Bai Wuchang than he was to the other royal children. He didn’t
make the request to save Bai Wuchang because of the
bloodline-connection, though.</p>
<p>As the son of the same mother, Bai Wuchang was extremely
talented, and King Bai loved him. Plus, Bai Wuchang didn’t want the
throne. He had done a great deal to make his brother the crown
prince.</p>
<p>By pleading in this way, he would give King Bai the impression
that he greatly loved his brother. And there was no reason for him
not to go, anyway.</p>
<p>King Bai still coldly responded, “Our deal with the Meka has
reached a critical point. We still need you to follow up. Don’t
worry; Fourth Uncle can resolve this. And Miss Mirror is also on
her way.”</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>Han Sen held Bao’er as he continued walking across the planet.
This planet wasn’t an ideal place for creatures to live. Aside from
the base, the rest of the environment was poor. Only a few
xenogeneics could live in such conditions.</p>
<p>That place was similar to a rocky moon. It was full of craters
that were the result of many meteor strikes. Many of them were
enormous geographical features, whereas others were as small as
football fields.</p>
<p>Asteroids near the planet were pulled down by the gravity of the
planet. That was why there were always meteors striking the
surface.</p>
<p>But now that the Ice Blue Knights had taken over the planet,
many of the larger meteors were eliminated before any harm was
dealt. The craters around Han Sen had formed before the Ice Blue
Knights took over the planet.</p>
<p>Bao’er secretly guided Han Sen. A short while later, Han Sen
reached one of the smaller craters. Han Sen looked into the crater,
and there was a broken rock at its center.</p>
<p>The broken rock gleamed slightly in a metallic way. It wasn’t
purple like Han Sen had expected, which disappointed him a bit.</p>
<p>But if Bao’er said there was some treasure available, it had to
be something good. Thinking of that improved his mood a little.</p>
<p>Ice Blue Knight King and the other knights watching the video
feed saw Han Sen walk next to the rocks with much confusion. They
were unsure what Han Sen was thinking.</p>
<p>They kept guessing what Han Sen might be up to, trying to
determine what he was planning. But still, they couldn’t unravel
whatever he had plotted.</p>
<p>As they watched intently, Han Sen moved many rocks away. On the
camera, they could see that there were many purple mushrooms
beneath the rubble.</p>
<p>Everyone was shocked. That planet wasn’t suitable for any form
of life, so neither creatures nor plants thrived there. Even
ordinary xenogeneics had a hard time on such a planet. Only some
xenogeneics adapted for outer space could live there for a
while.</p>
<p>But now, there were looking at a bunch of fist-sized purple
mushrooms. It was a very rare sight.</p>
<p>Han Sen, upon seeing the mushrooms, looked very happy.</p>
<p>While the knights watching the video feed could only see the
purple mushrooms, Han Sen could feel their lifeforce. And he could
tell that the purple mushrooms were almost as strong as King class
xenogeneics.</p>
<p>“Plant xenogeneics?” Han Sen looked at the purple mushrooms. He
counted there to be around seventy of them. Some of them were big,
whereas others were small. But they all had King class
lifeforces.</p>
<p>“These mushrooms, they cannot be the numbers mentioned by Night
River King, can they? Purple mushrooms. Is that what they were? No.
Look at these numbers. They should be code for some creature. These
cannot be the creatures that the code indicates. These mushrooms
should be the items infected by the numbers. So, what is this?” Han
Sen looked at them. Aside from the purple mushrooms, there was
nothing else around.</p>
<p>“They were always here… where are they?” Han Sen was remembering
the contents of Night River King’s diary, but the diary made no
explicit mention of where they were exactly.</p>
<p>Bao’er looked at the mushrooms, and she seemed ready to start
drooling. “Daddy, can I eat them?”</p>
<p>“Can you eat them?” Han Sen reached out his hand and tried to
pick up a mushroom. But before he could touch the mushroom, it
moved. The umbrella-like cap of the mushroom greatly expanded and
then grew smaller, blowing out a haze of purple mist.</p>
<p>Han Sen instantly shielded Bao’er and himself in Jadeskin
godlight. He made a wall of ice to shield them from the purple mist
that was emitted.</p>
<p>The purple mist came into contact with the ice wall and corroded
it. It happened so fast that the ice wall simply melted into that
purple color.</p>
<p>Han Sen’s eyebrows rose. “A very powerful toxic power.”</p>
<p>Ice Blue Knight King and the Extreme King’s Sixth Uncle, who
were watching the video, were immediately given a shock. They
couldn’t tell exactly what the mushrooms were from the video. But
now that they were seeing the mushrooms, they were stunned. They
knew that these strange things had to be King class plant
xenogeneics. The mushrooms had a very strong toxic power. If they
didn’t, they wouldn’t have corroded Han Sen’s ice light.</p>
<p>“Bao’er, do you really want to eat one of these? You must be
joking.” Han Sen looked at the poisonous purple mushrooms and spoke
to Bao’er.</p>
<p>“I’m not talking about the mushrooms. I was talking about that.”
Bao’er pointed at something next to the purple mushrooms.</p>
