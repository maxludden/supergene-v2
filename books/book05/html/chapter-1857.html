<h2>Killing the Raven</h2>
<h3>Chapter 1857</h3>

<p>Inside the broken egg, there was a featherless Raven. A deep
wound crossed its body, oozing purple smoke.</p>
<p>The Raven’s eyes were partly open, but little more than slits.
It looked furious, but it appeared to be suffering inside the
lava-like juice. And while it seemed to be unable to stand, it
lurched forward with the speed of lightning. Quickly, it came
toward Han Sen, seeking to bite him with a mouth wreathed in
fire.</p>
<p>Ghost Teeth Knife looked so angry in return, with its purple
mist. Han Sen did not have to activate it himself, as the blade
moved for him. It was like a hungry demon, and it wanted nothing
more than to kill.</p>
<p>The Raven had not fully developed yet. There were no feathers on
its body, and it was grievously injured. There was blood caking
most of its skin. The knife came at the Raven and cut it, leaving a
lesion across its flesh.</p>
<p>The full-power of a King class Ghost Teeth Knife only left a
scratch across it, though.</p>
<p>Han Sen kept moving, swinging his blade at the Raven as he went.
It was still small, and its eyes were only partially open. Its body
was still naked, and its skin wasn’t as firm and developed as it
could be. But even so, the Raven was not afraid of the assault.
After the attack, it looked at Han Sen with even anger.</p>
<p>King Jun had not said anything. He coldly looked at Han Sen with
an expression of pure hatred and murder. It was scary to
witness.</p>
<p>Eventually, the blood rain, thunder, and fire began to fade. The
palace had been reduced to little more than a ruin.</p>
<p>Han Sen slashed the bird again, delivering more and more wounds
upon it. Gold-blood spilled out of it, and it was clear Han Sen
would soon end up killing the Raven.</p>
<p>“Han Sen, if you kill it, you will never be rid of me.” King Jun
sounded calm when he spoke; so calm it was chilling. Katcha!</p>
<p>Without hesitation, Ghost Teeth Knife delivered a clean cut
across the Raven’s neck. The head was lopped right off.</p>
<p>King Jun did not say anything. He merely looked at Han Sen.
Then, he disappeared. But the look he had given Han Sen was
remarkable.</p>
<p>“Deified creature hunted: Baby Sun Raven. Sun Raven beast soul
obtained. Deified Gene obtained.”</p>
<p>When Han Sen heard the announcement, he was thrilled with
delight. When the Sun Raven was killed, the marks on the foreheads
of the others began to disappear, too. They became gold, and then
melted into their flesh with the rippling mirage of a fire.</p>
<p>Gu Qingcheng sat down on the ground and used her Qi Gong to
absorb the flame.</p>
<p>Xie Qing King’s body, meanwhile, was glowing with silver light.
Little Silver’s eyes flickered with lightning.</p>
<p>The Barons at the base used their skills to absorb the mark, but
the women and children were unable to. The gold blended into their
skin and changed their bodies instead.</p>
<p>Boom!</p>
<p>The mountain continued to shake. It came from the purple-bronze
hall. It seemed to have erupted, and the palace came flying at them
through the air.</p>
<p>“Han Sen? I will be back! Soon… soon…” King Jun’s voice echoed
through the underbelly of the mountain until the palace
disappeared.</p>
<p>Captain Wood wanted to get up, but he had been badly burned. His
flesh and even his bones had been charred. It didn’t seem likely
that he’d live.</p>
<p>“Sir, take my body back to Planet Green, if it is of no trouble
for you. That is where I was born, and if I am buried there,</p>
<p>I know it will make for a fine resting place,” Wood said.</p>
<p>“Wood, you raised me up. You have helped me a lot. Without you,
I would have been killed by those gold fires. I cannot let you
die,” Black Steel said as he tried to pick up Captain Wood. “Han
Sen, I am going to take him home to heal. I am going now.”</p>
<p>But Han Sen stopped him and said, “With the condition he is in,
he won’t even reach the base. He won’t reach another planet.”</p>
<p>“There is nothing else I can do. I have to do this!” Black Steel
said.</p>
<p>Han Sen thought for a moment, and then said, “Wait. There is a
better chance of him surviving right here.”</p>
<p>“Young Master, it is fine. I know what will happen to me. I will
be happy enough if you can take my lifeless body to Planet Green.”
Wood was surprisingly calm.</p>
<p>Black Steel asked Han Sen, “What are you suggesting?”</p>
<p>“His body was burned by fire, and his body is suffering from
fire poisoning. That is bad. He can’t make it to camp. But these
lotuses have a cold element within them. If they can suppress the
Raven mark, it will help the fire and perhaps eliminate the fire
poisoning,” Han Sen said.</p>
<p>“The lotuses might be able to clear the fire poisoning, but the
wounds…” Black Steel shook his head.</p>
<p>“That’s why we’ll need him,” Han Sen said, then whistled to the
sky.</p>
<p>Not long after, something silver emerged from the ruins. Little
Silver swiftly came before Han Sen.</p>
<p>Little Silver, bite the lotus and put it on his wounds.” Han Sen
gave Little Silver the lotus.</p>
<p>Little Silver took the plant and chewed it up. Then, he moved
over and spat it out over Wood’s wounds. The burned skin began to
smoke, and it made Wood scream in agony.</p>
<p>Little Silver chewed up a lot of the lotuses and placed them
atop all the wounds. And whenever the wounds came into contact with
the lotuses, it was like a ladle of water being poured over
smoldering charcoal.</p>
<p>The white lotuses turned black.</p>
<p>“Black Steel, feed him some lotus,” Han Sen told Black
Steel.</p>
<p>Black Steel crushed up some of the lotuses and fed Captain Wood.
He already seemed a little better after eating what he had been
given. His wounds were still really bad, though. It would be
difficult for him to be healed, but the mere fact that he was alive
was enough for now. He would survive long enough for his body to
recuperate.</p>
<p>“Thank you.” Captain Wood gave Han Sen a complicated look.</p>
<p>“Don’t thank me. This is because of Black Steel. Otherwise, I
wouldn’t care whether you lived or died,” Han Sen said coldly.</p>
<p>“No matter what the reason is, you saved me. And that means I
owe you.” Captain Wood shook his head.</p>
<p>Han Sen did not say anything in response. He really didn’t like
Wood, and the less he had to do with him, the better.</p>
<p>Xie Qing King and Gu Qingcheng soon appeared there. The marks on
their foreheads had indeed disappeared.</p>
<p>Black Steel picked up Captain Wood, and Han Sen lifted the Sun
Raven’s body. The entire carcass of the bird emanated a strange
power. It was not a xenogeneic, either. Han Sen was keen to
research what the thing really was.</p>
