<p>Han Sen looked at the 33 skies. He did not plan on going in. He
turned around and went to Space Garden.</p>
<p>Regardless of whether Qin Xiu and the other guys were there in
the 33 skies, if he went in now, he might not be able to earn any
benefits. Even if he made a blood path and went before the geno
tablet, conquering the geno tablet was not an easy thing to
accomplish.</p>
<p>Han Sen’s Break World-class Super God Spirit mode was not very
useful before the geno tablet. If it was not for using the
24-stroke geno spell password, he would have died inside the geno
tablet.</p>
<p>When Han Sen returned to Space Garden, he noticed the Very High
and those from Sky Palace had come there to settle.</p>
<p>The Extreme King, Dragon, Destroyed, and other high races had
not incurred as much destruction. They had managed to hold onto
their homelands, but they still sent people to Space Garden so they
could hold discussions about how they planned to fix the
universe.</p>
<p>The reason for that was because they did not have as many life
souls attacking them, and they had the protection of the God
Spirits. There were God Spirits in their races helping them to kill
the Break World beasts. The damage and devastation they incurred
were minimized a great deal.</p>
<p>In Space Garden, the Very High and Sky Palace did not believe in
the gods. They did not pray to the God Spirits either. So, they did
not receive any help from the God Spirits.</p>
<p>The Very High and Sky Palace co-operated with God Spirits, but
they did not believe in gods.</p>
<p>Plus, those three places had many life souls. They had suffered
the most damage. In the end, only Space Garden was able to hold
out. The Very High gave up Outer Sky while the Sky gave up Sky
Palace.</p>
<p>Fortunately, the Very High and the Sky were friendly. They did
not have many people, so they stayed in Space Garden. They gathered
their resources and strength to fight the changes now affecting
their universe.</p>
<p>Sky Palace Leader saw Han Sen return, so he asked “Han Sen, what
happened to the 33 skies?”</p>
<p>Han Sen saw that the Very High people and Space Garden people
were looking at him, so he told them the story once. “The geno
tablet in the 33 skies is a creature belonging to the God Chaos
Party’s old leader. Right now, it has returned to its origin. It
has become an item that no one knows. Any creature can become its
master, so all the scary creatures from the main and reverse
universes, including God Spirits, want to assert themselves as the
geno tablet’s new master.”</p>
<p>Of course, Han Sen did not tell them he was the one who had made
the 33 skies return to origin.</p>
<p>“People say treasure is owned by those who fight for it,” a Very
High elder said. “Perhaps there is still a chance.”</p>
<p>Sky Palace Leader Zhang Xuandao lifted his lips and said,
“According to the rules of the Very High, all the treasure is
related to the Very High.”</p>
<p>The Very High elder looked rather upset as he asked, “What do
you mean?”</p>
<p>The Very High and the Sky hailed from the same origin, but they
did not like each other. There were some disagreements between
them. Even though this elder practiced Very High Sense and had
almost reached Very High’s Forget Love level, whenever he saw Zhang
Xuandao, he was a bit intense.</p>
<p>Zhang Xuandao smiled and said, “Good words. The power of you
Very High people is against the sky. You are stronger than the
Break World beasts in the thirty-three skies. You can try your
luck. It is a shame we Sky Palace students are all too weak and
cannot even enter the 33 skies. We cannot try something that you
call luck. The treasure will be in the hands of you guys, the Very
High.”</p>
<p>After hearing Zhang Xuandao’s mocking words, everyone knew he
was implying that they did not have the power to breach the 33
skies. They would be unable to control the geno tablet.</p>
<p>Han Sen could not be bothered listening to them. He did not plan
on going to the 33 skies yet. He got up and prepared to leave the
meeting room. He was looking for Ji Yanran and Ling’er.</p>
<p>“Han Sen, our research has yet to yield a result,” the Very High
elder said. “How could you just leave?”</p>
<p>“I am old. There is nothing I can do. You guys talk to
Littleflower. Just keep me informed when you figure something out.
I will do whatever you guys need me to.” Han Sen patted
Littleflower on the shoulder. “Son, you have grown up, and your
father is old. I am going to go see your mother. Take care of your
little sister. You will be the one in charge of the family’s
safety.”</p>
<p>“Dad…” Littleflower looked as if he was going to smile and cry
at Han Sen at the same time.</p>
<p>Han Sen whispered this into Littleflower’s ears, “Good luck. Do
it if you can. If you can’t, then you should run. It is fine if you
cannot achieve victory. It is better than dying.”</p>
<p>What he said was so quiet, but the top-class elites were still
able to hear him. Many of the elites of all the other races felt
weird hearing it.</p>
<p>“You guys keep talking, but I am leaving.” After saying that,
Han Sen left the meeting room.</p>
<p>When Han Sen left the room, Yisha walked out, too. Han Sen asked
her, “Teacher, are you getting used to living here?”</p>
<p>“It is not too shabby.” Yisha looked at Han Sen and said,
“Dollar, you didn’t forget we still have a grudge match to
settle.”</p>
<p>“Teacher, why are you doing this?” Han Sen asked. “Killing each
other is not nice.”</p>
<p>“Watch me.” Yisha suddenly jumped. She pulled out her knife and
drew it near Han Sen’s neck.</p>
<p>Han Sen’s reaction was very fast. Yisha was one of the top
elites of the whole geno universe, but she hadn’t broken the world
yet. She was not a threat to Han Sen.</p>
<p>She was Han Sen’s teacher, so he did not take the knife. He took
a step back and dodged the knife that was coming to cut his head
off.</p>
<p>Yisha used Teeth Knife and kept slashing at Han Sen. She did not
use all of her power, but the knife mind and the knife skill were
the best knife talents she could ever strive to achieve.</p>
<p>Han Sen had to admit that her knife mind was almost as good as
his.</p>
<p>She used Teeth Knife, but Yisha’s knife was unable to touch Han
Sen. Yisha pulled her knife back. She looked at Han Sen and said,
“There is nothing else I can teach you. Do not ever think about
calling me teacher again.”</p>
<p>“If you are a teacher for one day, then you are a teacher
forever…”</p>
<p>Before Han Sen finished, Yisha interrupted him. “I am not that
old, and you are not that young. Just call me Yisha.”</p>
<p>After that, Yisha ignored Han Sen. She went back to where the
Rebate were living.</p>
<p>Han Sen felt a wry smile develop. He watched Yisha leave. He
then returned to his house in Space Garden.</p>
<p>Ji Yanran was holding Ling’er while watching anime. Seeing Han
Sen come back, Ling’er flew out of Ji Yanran’s arms and landed
against Han Sen’s chest with her arms around his neck.</p>
<p>“Dad, why are you only back now?” Ling’er asked while acting all
cute. “Ling’er has missed you so much. I am so hungry.”</p>
<p>“Dear Daughter, what do you want to eat? I will make it for
you.” Han Sen happily patted Ling’er on the head.</p>
<p>“I want to eat dragon meat from Green Planet. I want to drink
coconut juice from Long Ka Nan Planet…” Ling’er lifted up her
little fingers as she spoke.</p>
<p>“You didn’t miss me. You only miss my wallet.” Han Sen rubbed
Ling’er’s small nose and smiled.</p>
<p>“Dad, you should not rub my nose. Mother said the nose needs to
be tall to be pretty. If you keep rubbing it, it will not grow tall
and will look bad. Then, no man will want to marry me.” Ling’er
used her hands to protect her nose.</p>
<p>“Mother is lying to you. Look at your mother’s nose. It is not
that tall, but she still managed to find your father, who is a good
man.” Han Sen looked all cocky.</p>
<p>Ling’er looked at Ji Yanran. She then looked at Han Sen. “I will
stick to protecting my nose.”</p>
<p>“What is that supposed to mean?” Han Sen realized what she meant
and started to tickle Ling’er.</p>
