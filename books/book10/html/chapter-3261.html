<h2>Zhao Ning’er</h2>
<h3>Chapter 3261</h3>

<p>In many types of species, the right to mate was something to
achieve.</p>
<p>Male deer wanted to mate. When they fought off their opponents,
they would lock horns. They would continue to fight even if their
antlers broke.</p>
<p>In wolf packs, the strongest wolf king was the first one that
was allowed to mate. The strong male wolves that were a little
weaker or the weak male wolves were not allowed to mate.</p>
<p>Now, the nobles in the Qin Kingdom’s Jade Wall City were like
male deer or wolves. They raised their heads and rubbed their
fists, waiting for Zhao Kingdom’s No. 1 singer, Zhao Ning’er, to
arrive. Over the past few years, the Qin Kingdom and the Zhao
Kingdom had not fought. They seemed fairly peaceful.</p>
<p>Zhao Ning’er was now holding a concert in Jade Wall City. Many
Jade Wall City officers supported the notion, and people paid a lot
of money to see her face in the flesh. They wanted to know if she
was as good as the videos showed her to be.</p>
<p>Of course, more nobles were hoping to have something else happen
with Zhao Ning’er. When Zhao Ning’er had just entered Jade Wall
City, it created major traffic jams.</p>
<p>Han Sen was not like the others. He was not in the mood to go
take care of Zhao Ning’er. He had been spending his time
investigating the reversed version of The Story of Genes.</p>
<p>After combining with ice jade evil lady, their two powers were
able to reach Break World levels. Unfortunately, their control
powers, compatibility levels, and distribution of strength had some
inherent gaps. There were bound to be problems further down the
line. This was just a problem that arose from a lack of experience.
After combining for a while, their issues would most likely sort
themselves out. There was no need to worry about these issues too
much.</p>
<p>Han Sen practiced four geno arts. Only The Story of Genes had
not yet reached Break World status. That was the primary subject of
Han Sen’s recent investigations. He was hoping it would not take
long before he found a way to have The Story of Genes break the
world too.</p>
<p>He needed the power to guarantee his safety. Han Sen was
currently not Qin Xiu’s foe, but he also could not defeat Qin
Wan’er. He had to improve his strength.</p>
<p>The Super God Spirit mode was a type of body. There was no skill
associated with it. There was no method of running its air.
Although Han Sen knew there was a reverse Super God Spirit mode out
there, he could not use reverse Super God Spirit mode. The only way
for him to level up was to practice the four geno arts he had or
get better geno arts altogether.</p>
<p>Since rare gene races were hard to obtain, Han Sen had gone to a
lot of trouble to get his hands on the ice jade evil lady. At the
end of the day, it was pretty much useless for him to have. That
path for him to traverse was no good. It was worse than when he
used to reinforce his body.</p>
<p>When Han Sen combined with the ice jade evil lady, he repeatedly
tried to analyze her power. He was hoping to break the world
without combining with the ice jade evil lady so he would not be
restricted.</p>
<p>Han Sen was most depressed about the fact that reverse Jadeskin
powers were weird. He had examined the power structure, but he was
unable to simulate it. It seemed as if only the body of a woman
could attain that power.</p>
<p>With that being the case, Han Sen focused his mind on
researching The Story of Gene. His research of The Story of Gene
had been going on for a long time now.</p>
<p>A scary power surged through Han Sen’s body. His cells were like
nuclear bombs quickly detonating. It made Han Sen spill blood. He
had to stop his The Story of Gene reverse power.</p>
<p>jers</p>
<p>The Story of Gene’s Forever Solid power was different. Reversing
The Story of Gene powers was too cruel. Han Sen had only just tried
reversing The Story of Gene when he felt his gene chain break and
cells explode like the end of the world.</p>
<p>It was just that little amount of power that made Han Sen
tremble in fear. That power was too scary. Even with Han Sen’s
powerful body, he could not block the power of The Story of
Gene.</p>
<p>“That big, destructive power was not just in my body,” Han Sen
said with a frown. “Even my Super God Spirit mode would be unable
to block it. It is a geno art that cannot be practiced.”</p>
<p>The power of the reverse The Story of Gene was too cruel. It
could not be practiced. His body was not capable of harnessing it.
He could not even try it, so how could he succeed? This harkened
Han Sen back to the time he first tried to practice The Story of
Gene. He was unable to begin it back then, as The Story of Gene
required absurd amounts of fitness. It was too high, so he could
not get it started. Han Sen needed the black crystal armor to get
it going</p>
<p>Now, the reverse The Story of Gene had the same issue, but Han
Sen did not have the black crystal armor anymore.</p>
<p>“People have to rely on themselves.” Han Sen took a deep breath.
He used power to heal the damage he had just been inflicted. He
then used the reverse version of The Story of Gene.</p>
<p>Han Sen was not thinking about whether or not he could survive
it. All he wanted to do was find a rhythm within that scary
power.</p>
<p>The reverse The Story of Gene only ran for a moment when Han
Sen’s body suddenly cracked. His entire body looked like a ceramic
vase that had been cracked and crudely glued together again. He was
full of cracks, and they started to bleed.</p>
<p>He immediately stopped running the reverse version of The Story
of Gene. That short moment was almost enough to destroy his body.
He didn’t reverse it completely, so he was not about to continue
running it.</p>
<p>Han Sen could only fix his body and think about that destructive
power. He hoped to learn something soon.</p>
<p>It was a shame it only went on for a moment and his body was
destroyed. Han Sen could not glean much from the experience.</p>
<p>Han Sen kept enabling himself to be tortured by the scary power
without giving up. The reverse version of The Story of Gene damaged
his body a lot, which proved just how strong the reverse version of
The Story of Gene was. Perhaps after The Story of Gene broke the
world, the power would be so scary that one could not even imagine
it.</p>
<p>In a bright castle in Jade Wall City, many rich people were
seated. There were many of the Qin Kingdom’s nobles and famous
people.</p>
<p>The party’s focus was not on them. It was on a 20-year-old young
lady who looked pure. She was a woman who emitted freshness.</p>
<p>Sky King, who had been summoned back to Jade Wall City, was
attending this party. He was drinking and listening to Zhao
Ning’er’s songs. “When it comes to prettiness, Zhao Ning’er might
not be the hottest across all the seven kingdoms, but the pure
youthfulness of her young body can make us and our old bodies very
jealous,” Sky King quietly said, with his eyes looking like they
were on fire. “I want to take her youth and become her age so I can
do whatever I want.”</p>
<p>The man next to Sky King laughed. “If it was not for that, why
would Zhao Ning’er be adored by all seven kingdoms? It isn’t just
us. Even those old antiques love Zhao Ning’er. Well, they at least
love how refreshing she is. Through her, they want to see their
past selves.”</p>
<p>“Jade Wall City has only just experienced big bad luck,” Sky
King said. “For her to come to Jade Wall City now will surely make
others think of something.”</p>
<p>“Yes. Jade Wall City has endured bad luck recently, but it is
still stronger than the Zhao Kingdom. If she tries something, I am
fairly certain we can deal with it.”</p>
<p>While they were talking, Zhao Ning’er finished her song.
Everyone in the hall started to clap.</p>
<p>Zhao Ning’er bowed. She looked at everyone and asked, “While I
was in the Zhao Kingdom, I heard about the Qin Kingdom’s No. 1
swordsman, Han Sen. Is Mister Han here today?”</p>
