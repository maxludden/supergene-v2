<p>Moon Wheel King was right. Han Sen’s Moon only had thirty
percent of his own gentle power, and that was because Han Sen’s
Dongxuan Sutra had only been able to simulate thirty percent.</p>
<p>Han Sen’s Dongxuan Sutra was still at a low level, though, so he
was still pleased that he had managed to simulate thirty percent.
If his Dongxuan Sutra ascended, it would not be difficult to
increase that percentage.</p>
<p>“Han Sen, you are good for causing people trouble.” Yisha
sighed. She had already learned about the incident in which he
performed Moon.</p>
<p>Just as Han Sen had believed, Yisha had given him Moon as
another test. He had only practiced it for a short time, and he had
only seen the Narrow Moon Knife once. The fact that he had still
managed such a breakthrough was astounding, and it allayed her
fears. She no longer had trouble believing Han Sen, and she was
sure he really was just that talented.</p>
<p>It did give Yisha conflicted feelings, though. Anyone would love
to have a student that talented, but every time she thought about
how hard it was to level up Han Sen, it gave her a headache.</p>
<p>Yisha sighed and spoke to herself, “I need to make a plan to see
where he can go in order to level up. I can’t wholly rely on my
finite supply of resources. It won’t take him very far.”</p>
<p>Han Sen was back on Planet Eclipse, and while the feeling and
memory were still with him, he continued his practice of Moon. That
gentle skill was quite useful, and it suited Han Sen well.</p>
<p>When Han Sen had a chance at night, he’d return to the sanctuary
to be with his family.</p>
<p>Today, Han Sen went home. Luolan and Han Yufei looked happy.
They spoke to Han Sen and said, “A baby’s coming! A baby’s
coming!”</p>
<p>Han Sen’s body shivered. His eyes opened wide, staring at his
parents. He complimented them, saying, “Dad, you are still very
manly. Are you saying I have another little brother or little
sister on the way?”</p>
<p>“What are you talking about?” Luolan hit Han Sen across the
head. She blushed, and happily said, “It’s Yanran! She’s having a
girl.”</p>
<p>“Ah!” Han Sen was so happy, he almost jumped.</p>
<p>“Go and see her.” Han Yufei patted Han Sen on the shoulder.</p>
<p>The family was happy that Ji Yanran was pregnant. It helped to
reduce the trauma of Littlleflower having been taken, and Ji Yanran
particularly felt better because of it.</p>
<p>She had only been pregnant for three months, though. So, it
would be a while before the birth.</p>
<p>Han Sen had told people he was off to kill xenogeneics as an
excuse. That way, he could spend a lot more time with Ji Yanran at
home.</p>
<p>People worked at the base, and he didn’t really need xenogeneic
genes. His Viscount gene tally was already maxed out, anyway. Until
he became an Earl, there was no point in eating xenogeneic
genes.</p>
<p>Han Sen wanted to stay with Ji Yanran until she delivered, but
the base soon had news. Yisha was going to the Buddha, and she
wanted Han Sen to go with her. Han Sen couldn’t decline, so he
packed his stuff and went to Planet Blade. There, he got on a ship
alongside Yisha.</p>
<p>“My Queen, why are you going to see the Buddha?” Since Han Sen
was here, he wanted this to be over as soon as possible.</p>
<p>Yisha was flying the ship. She didn’t look at Han Sen, and she
wasn’t using her ordinary battleship. She was driving a smaller
ship, where only she and Han Sen could occupy it.</p>
<p>“Burning Lamp Alpha gives a speech every century. We are going
to listen to him speak, with the Buddha,” Yisha said. “Is he the
leader of the Buddha?” Han Sen asked.</p>
<p>Yisha nodded and said, “Burning Lamp Alpha is the one that lit
the geno lantern. There aren’t many of these alphas still alive
amongst the higher races.”</p>
<p>“Deified elites? We really should listen to his words
carefully!” Han Sen said.</p>
<p>Surprisingly, Yisha said, “You don’t need to listen to the
speech. But you do have to go to the Buddha’s heaven.” “Heaven?”
Han Sen looked at Yisha with confusion.</p>
<p>Yisha smiled and said, “After the alpha has made his speech, he
will open up heaven. People are only allowed to go there once in
their entire lifetime. I have already been. I am taking you there
so you can walk through their heaven. It might help you level
up.”</p>
<p>“What are the benefits of walking there?” Han Sen asked,
blinking.</p>
<p>“It is difficult to say. If you walk well, it might help you
greatly. If you walk poorly, you might not gain anything at all.
You will find out when you’re there, so there’s no point in me
explaining it to you right now,” Yisha said shortly.</p>
<p>Han Sen was curious about the Buddha, particularly because of
Ancient Devil. He really wanted to know more about them.</p>
<p>If what Ancient Devil said was true, Asura was somehow connected
to the Buddha. And even the Shura of the Alliance and the Demons of
the geno universe had some link to the Buddha.</p>
<p>The Buddha were friends of the Rebate, and they weren’t too far
away from each other. Yisha drove the ship fairly lackadaisically.
She wasn’t in much of a rush.</p>
<p>“This planet is called Planet Magic. It is one of the planets of
the Buddha. The planet is controlled by the Magic. They are an
interesting race. It’s good that you will get a look at them.”
Yisha parked her ship in the spaceport and took him to disembark
with her.</p>
<p>Han Sen wanted to get all this done as soon as he could, so he
could get back to spending time with Ji Yanran. But he couldn’t
change Yisha’s mind, so he followed her around.</p>
<p>When he stepped off the ship, he saw a creature that was
reminiscent of a basketball. It wasn’t exactly like one, but they
were circular. They were around the same size as one, and they came
in a variety of colors. Their textures were jellylike, and they
hopped to move around. They had big eyes, and they looked really
cute.</p>
<p>“These jellies are the Magic?” Han Sen asked curiously.</p>
<p>Yisha nodded. “They are a special race. They are not hostile,
but their attack power is more surprising than you would
think.”</p>
<p>When Han Sen wished to ask why, a pink glob of jelly hopped in
front of them. It looked right at Yisha. And then, suddenly, it
made a pop noise. The pink jelly took on Yisha’s shape.</p>
<p>Han Sen’s eyes opened wide in shock. Aside from the weaker
energy, the pink jelly became Yisha and looked exactly like
her.</p>
<p>Yisha did not seem to mind the mimic, and she even stroked the
Magic’s head. It enjoyed the touch, and it rubbed her hands.</p>
<p>Han Sen reached out to touch it, too, but Yisha gave him a stem
look. It was then that Han Sen realized that if he fondled the
Magic, it would practically be the same as him touching Yisha.</p>
<p>It was a shame, but he withdrew his hand.</p>
<p>“Welcome! Our Magic baby was born not too long ago. Are you guys
interested in it?” The Magic that looked like Yisha spoke.</p>
<p>“Shit! What is this? Are they selling kids? They have a planet
protected by the Buddha, so they can’t be doing anything that bad!”
Han Sen thought.</p>
