  Han Sen spent a whole day breaking the shura qi in Luo Haitang. He might have saved Luo Haitang’s life, but the power of Godslayer Luo was dead.

Luo Haitang responded well, though. He could not make use of the Falsified-Sky Sutra without the power of Shura Change, so he gave it to Han Sen and bid that he do whatever he wished with it.

Although Han Sen did not really care about the Falsified-Sky Sutra, it was a trouble for Han Yan. So, he planned to visit the shura and sort it out. Plus, Han Sen still wished to figure out the relationship between the shura and Asura.

He stayed with the Luo family for a few days, but before he returned, Bao’er said she wanted to return to the sanctuary.

Han Sen asked her why, and she said that it was because the gourd had matured and she now wished to see it.

Han Sen did not know if he could go back, though. He tried stepping into a teleporter, and it worked. They arrived in a spirit hall in the Fourth God’s Sanctuary, but it was still random and he did not know where he had ended up.

When he walked out of the teleporter, two angry monsters approached. Han Sen merely waved his hand, making them fly away and get pinned against nearby walls.

The inhabitants of the entire shelter were shaken after seeing that, and they did not dare attack. Han Sen grabbed a hold of a creature that spoke the human language, and after finding out where he was, he and Bao’er made off in the direction that would take them to the underworld.

Han Sen didn’t kill the creatures there, though. It would be pointless for him to do so, and it would be best if he saved them for others.

Bao’er told him the gourd had matured. He didn’t know how she knew, but he was confident that she was correct. There was no reason to doubt, and Han Sen himself wanted to see what was inside the gourd.

Han Sen kept flying in the direction of the underworld, worried that the Dark Spirit Elder might have already done something to the gourd.

Han Sen spread his own lifeforce around, so others would know he had come and creatures and spirits wouldn’t bother him. They traveled to the underworld.

He went straight to Mask Shelter to see Ling Mei’er, but she was no longer there. The snake wasn’t there, either. He asked the creatures where they were, and he was told that they had gone to Dark Spirit Shelter.

Han Sen traveled to Dark Spirit Shelter with no difficulty or doubt.

Dark Spirit Elder looked rather bored in the vine garden. The gourd there was shining like some glowing orb, with enough luminosity to light the entire shelter. It was like a glowing fountain of life. The creatures of the underworld were growing quickly, and many geno plants mutated in the warmth of its glow.

Dark Spirit received the most benefits, and this was a good thing. Dark Spirit definitely had a bright future, but Dark Spirit Elder could not pick the gourd or block the lifeforce.

A few days later, news had spread. Many elites came, and they were elders, too.

Dark Spirit Elder did not wish to share the treasure he had held onto for years, and while there were so many enemies, he could not pick the gourd and move it. It was likely Dark Spirit could end up destroyed.

After that, Dark Spirit Elder established a few rules. He allowed others to come into the shelter and try to grab the fruit. If they could remove it from the vine, then it was theirs to keep. If they failed, they’d have to leave and never bother them again.

All the other elders had the same problem as Dark Spirit Elder. None were able to pick it up.

Dark Spirit Elder was happy that it was over, but Beast Elder and Feather Elder were hoping to claim the shelter itself.

“Beast, Feather; are you this shameless? We made a deal. Since you were unable to claim it, you should have left. Now you wish to conquer my shelter! Care you nothing for the Hundred Tribe Contract?” Dark Spirit tried to contain his anger.

Feather Elder smiled and said, “We will uphold the contract. We don’t want to take the shelter from you, we just want to… share it. If you don’t want to live with us, then you can always move.”

“Obscene,” said Ling Mei’er, who was near the elder.

Feather looked cold. He fired an arrow towards Ling Mei’er, coldly saying, “I was talking to your elder. You do not have a rank worthy of speaking with me.”

Dark Spirit Elder was shocked by the sudden transgression. He smacked the arrow away and protected Ling Mei’er, angrily shouting, “Feather! Do not do that!”

“So? Let me make this clear today. Dark Spirit folks, get lost! Otherwise, ready yourself to become fertilizer for the treasure.” Beast Elder didn’t even try to feign politeness. He stared at the Dark Spirit members with an evil look, as if he was hungry and wanted to eat them.

Dark Spirit was very angry, but seeing the elder-class enemies, they did not dare say anything back. All they could do was stare with moody faces.

Dark Spirit Elder looked glum. He had to give up the shelter he had lived in for so long, and the treasure with it. It was something very few could ever accept.

But if he didn’t leave, the whole of the Dark Spirit Tribe would be destroyed.

Dark Spirit Elder gritted his teeth, looked at Ling Mei’er and the grandkids, and said, “Let’s leave.’

“Elder…” All the Dark Spirits looked shocked.

“Don’t say a word. Let’s leave.” Dark Spirit Elder was gritting his teeth so hard that he thought they were going to crack. If he was alone, he’d have fought. But he had to leave to secure the safety of his people.

“That’s right. It’s nice to see you so understanding!” Feather Elder mocked them.

Dark Spirit Elder ignored their mocking, though, and called for the evacuation.

Before he left, he took one last look at the gourd on the vine, and he felt terrible. He couldn’t find a word to describe what he was feeling.

The Dark Spirit submitted to the humiliation and left. Not even Dark Spirit Elder knew what they could do. Ever since the hundred tribe war, they hadn’t had to leave the underworld. And there were so many people, they did not know where they could go.

As they walked away, something suddenly came toward them with speed. The lifeforce felt very scary, and even Dark Spirit Elder was frightened by its approach.
