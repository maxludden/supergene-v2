  Finally, it is the fourth round. I wonder if Golden Growler is Little Gold Gold. Han Sen stared at the space battleground in contemplation, waiting for Golden Growler to be revealed.

If Golden Growler was really Little Gold Gold, Han Sen was worried about who its opponent might have been.

Although it was composed of only three words, one would know what kind of race Ancient Thunder God was. It was a very scary being composed of only three words.

Ancient God was the race with the least amount of beings out of the three high races. There didn't have very high numbers, and it was almost impossible for them to obtain more. Every generation of the Ancient God was the result of one dying. It was a case of death and being reborn.

Han Sen's body had Ancient Water God's Ancient God Origin. In the future, it might become the new Ancient Water God.

In the past, Han Sen saw Ancient Water God assault the geno hall. He thought Ancient Water God was an almighty being, but he did not know how powerful it was. Now that he thought about it, it was likely a scary being that was true god class.

Ancient Gods were born deified. It was not rare for the beings of that race to become true god. If Golden Growler was Little Gold Gold, going up against Ancient Thunder God would make it a bad fight for him.

The sky shimmered with streaks of lightning as an Ancient God giant formed of electricity appeared in the space battleground. It was the same as Ancient Water God. Ancient Gods were creatures that were formed of pure energy. Ancient Thunder God's whole body was composed completely of thunder. Every movement it made was carried with the strength of thunder. The whole of space flickered with lightning like it was there but not there. It was like it was connected to the Ancient Thunder God.

To be honest, if it was all based on one's appearance, Ancient Thunder God looked more like a god spirit than King Jun and the others.

Seeing Ancient Thunder God's substance chains move, Han Sen's heart felt as if it was sinking. He started to hope Golden Growler was not Little Gold Gold. No matter which way he viewed it, Ancient Thunder God was a true god elite that was at the top of the pyramid.

A shadow quickly appeared in the space battleground near Ancient Thunder God. The body was not that big. It was only around 3 feet tall. The body looked as if it had been made of gold. It kind of looked like a lion or a Kirin. Its head had a gold horn, and its hair looked as if it had been made of gold.

It really is Little Gold Gold! Han Sen was excited and happy about that. He was exuberant to see Little Gold Gold again. He was also surprised to see Little Gold Gold's first fight was against Ancient Thunder God. This match was likely going to be worse than good. He suspected Little Gold Gold was going to lose.

"Growler's blood still exists, but its blood does not seem to be pure." God looked at Little Gold Gold with interest.

When Little Gold Gold was kidnapped by the green-haired beast, Han Sen knew what Growler bloodline Little Gold Gold had. But that was not what he was concerned about. He just hoped Little Gold Gold would turn out OK and safe. After all, his opponent was Ancient Thunder God.

In this universe, not many creatures were able to recognize the blood of Little Gold Gold. Not everyone was as smart as God. After all, Little Gold Gold did not have pure blood. He looked a bit different from the old growler too. The only ones that could recognize Golden Growler were the oldest people in the universe. Not many people knew what the growlers looked like in this day and age.

Ancient Thunder God was not in the mood to figure out where Little Gold Gold came from. His voice was like a thunderstorm that rolled through space. He said, "If you leave now, you may continue with your petty existence."

Little Gold Gold looked at Ancient Thunder God with eyes that appeared like gold glass. He did not speak or concede and exist the space battleground.

Ancient Thunder God stopped talking. His eyes were brewing with the power of thunder. They suddenly became two electric laser beams that came straight for Little Gold Gold. There was enough power in that attack to blow up a giant planet.

"It really is a true god being!" When Han Sen saw the scary thunder god light, he was worried.

"Ancient Gods really are the loved ones of the universe. They are born deified. The chance to become a true god is the highest amongst the three high races. It is a shame they have difficulty breeding. If it was easy for them, the whole universe would undoubtedly be under their control." Dia Robber could not help but be complimentary.

Just as he spoke, the thunder power was going to land on Little Gold Gold's face. When it did, Little Gold Gold opened his mouth.

Little Gold Gold's body was only 3 feet tall, but his head was big. It was like a male lion's head. Ancient Thunder God was like a thunder giant that was 300 feet tall. They were not even close to being the same scale in size.

When Little Gold Gold opened his mouth, it became massive. It was like it could swallow the sky and earth. The scary bolt of electricity shot into his mouth. It did not affect Little Gold Gold. Ancient Thunder God's giant thunder giant body was swallowed by Little Gold Gold.

Everyone in the universe was dead silent. Even the scariest deified creatures were suddenly petrified. They all looked upon Little Gold Gold, who looked entirely normal once again.

Belch!

Little Gold Gold looked full. He opened his mouth and burped. A roll of thunder came with it. Then, it left the space battleground wagging its tail.

"Is that it? Is it all over?"

"What just happened? Was Ancient Thunder God swallowed by a little gold beast?"

"I think that's what happened, and he burped."

"No way... That was Ancient Thunder God... The incredibly powerful Ancient God... How could it be swallowed... This has to be fake... It has to be fake... Ancient Thunder God will fight his way out of the creature's stomach..."

"Fight your ass! Did you not see the geno god list? Didn't you see Golden Growler's rank increase?"

"Holy shit! What kind of creature is that? It is so powerful."

Everyone in the universe was shocked. No one expected Ancient Thunder God, who was so powerful, would be swallowed by a little gold beast they had never seen before.

Ordinary creatures were shocked by how scary Golden Growler was, but many true elites had strange expressions.

"Eating Dragon Phoenix. Eating Ancient God. The blood of the growlers continues in this universe." Bai King's face looked deathly serious.

"Do the growlers still have blood in this universe?" Old Vulture and a few others were in shock.

"The growler bloodline still exists. It looks like the universe is going to go crazy." On the top floor of the Very High's court in Outer Sky, an old man opened his eyes and looked at the space battleground. His face changed.

"Ha! Ha! The whole universe should be quivering in their boots after witnessing the power of little mountain leader!" the green-haired growler happily roared. "The growlers are back. Empty Mountain's invincible beast king is back." He felt as if he was the one who won the match and swallowed Ancient Thunder God.

Han Sen was shocked, but he did not care if it was Golden Growler or not. Little Gold Gold had become supremely powerful. He was very happy about that.

Little Gold Gold has become so powerful in such a short amount of time. I should work harder. Han Sen grabbed a chunk of the ink feather god bird's meat and shoved it in his mouth. He increased the speed of its refinery.

"Deified gene +1," the announcement said in his mind.

"This Golden Growler mix is no worse than a pure-blood growler. It might seem even better. That is so weird." God looked at Little Gold Gold with interest.

No matter what the case was, that entire fight shocked the whole universe, and it heralded the return of Empty Mountain. The growlers were back.
