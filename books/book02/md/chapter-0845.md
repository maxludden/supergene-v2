  "Why do I always bend over backwards if it means securing a coin or two? I will die for this money, I tell you!" Wang Yuhang was speaking to himself, doing his best to inspire a return of confidence.

"Little Uncle, what you have just said is not down to luck. If you want to make an inspirational speech, don't tell yourself you are going to die!" Han Sen laughed.

Wang Yuhang replied, "Oh, yes. That is correct! I am going to waltz into that mangled hive of doom and tango out with vast riches I can use to woo a woman and make her my wife! If you are listening, God, disregard what I said earlier."

Wang Yuhang started to leg it forward, but Han Sen pulled him back and said, "Whoa, don't rush. We should be extra sure of what we're walking into here. Fire an arrow from afar and then run. You'll need as much distance as you can get."

"Oh, yes. Of course! I am not an imbecile, I'll have you know. I am an aged warrior, one who has far more experience than you in such arts." Wang Yuhang rolled his eyes, and then started his approach from the nearby stands of trees. He slithered around like a snake doing the mamba, and when he was in firing range, fired an arrow towards the minotaur.

When the arrow took flight, he didn't wait to see if he had struck his desired target. As soon as the arrow loosed, he ran off quicker than a spooked bunny.

Han Sen froze in disbelief. He had missed, and the minotaur was none the wiser.

Pat!

But just as Han Sen believed Wang Yuhang to have failed, the ground seemed to quake and move. A rocky golem picked itself up out of the mud. Catching sight of the human who had disturbed its slumber, it cried out and chased after Wang Yuhang.

This also spooked the minotaur, and after propping its spear, it ran after Wang Yuhang, as well.

The bird in the sky divebombed in his direction, with its razor eyes peering at its troublesome prey.

"Not bad." Han Sen sighed with relief. The arrow had totally missed its target, but even despite that, he had managed to draw the ire of at least three super creatures.

Seeing Wang Yuhang about to lose his lead and succumb to the creatures that hounded him, Han Sen stealthily caught up.

Han Sen did not dare attack just yet, as they were too close to the Devil-Blood Shelter. The creatures inside the shelter, if they were made aware of the trouble outside, would send out reinforcements before he'd be able to slay even just one. Escape from such a situation would be no trivial task.

"Bossman, save me!" Wang Yuhang called out at the top of his lungs when he caught a glimpse of the manic bird that was descending upon him.

It was still too soon to do anything, however. To avoid his presence being known, Han Sen just continued to follow, ignoring Wang Yuhang's plight. They still needed to go further before doing anything.

Wang Yuhang was a proficient kiter, but even his speed could not outpace a super creature. Eventually, the bird did indeed catch up. It twirled its lethal talons in the air to cast bladed gusts of wind after him.

The rocky giant, at the same time, threw its boulder-fist into the earth and created a large hole.

As this was happening, the minotaur swung its spear to cast a fireball towards Wang Yuhang. Quite clearly, he was now in danger.

"Bossman, save me! I will not last much longer, I beseech your immediate aid! This entire ordeal was a maniacal concoction of your own twisted mind. You tricked me into this. Aaargh!" Wang Yuhang cried out, pitiably.

The razor-winds sliced his arm, drawing an alarming cascade of blood. The fireball caught his clothes on fire, which set him ablaze. Through the fire and blood, he was being pursued by three super creatures. And now, more than ever, he truly was in danger. His life was at risk.

But still, Han Sen ignored his cries for aid. He expected Wang Yuhang to have used his Angel Gene Fluid by now, but he hadn't. Han Sen thought it was typical of the cheap and stingy bastard he thought he was.

They were still too close to the shelter. Attacking now would foil his plans of infiltration. And as Wang Yuhang was still alive and able to scream and shout just fine, he'd let him be chased for a while longer.

When Wang Yuhang noticed his cries for help being ignored by Han Sen, he acknowledged the danger he was in. He realized that he might well and truly die where he was. With great regret, he knew what he had to do. He pulled out his injector and a vial of Angel Gene Fluid and gave himself a shot of the super juice.

As Wang Yuhang ran, his eyes turned red. A horn grew out of his forehead, and his speed and agility increased.

He was still under the cruel pursuit of three super creatures, but at least he wasn't suffering anymore. Managing to flee their wrath with greater ease, he reached the cover of the forest much sooner.

"He should have done that far sooner. Being stingy at a time like this is a surefire way to reach an early grave." Han Sen despised his hesitance.

Wang Yuhang's mobility was admirable as he attempted to escape. It was quite remarkable, watching him flee. Han Sen couldn't help comparing it to a salmon leaping upstream with unpredictable movements. Still, it wasn't anywhere near the dexterity one could exert when making use of Heavenly Go.

Impressed by what he saw, Han Sen used his dongxuan aura to track his movements. Surprisingly, he found it difficult to predict what he'd do next. He had mustered a very strange manner of flight.

Every time Han Sen predicted a movement, he'd be wrong. But he didn't think Wang Yuhang moved the way he did consciously, and it was more like he was making up his movements as he went. Each step was random, but despite that, the results were good.

Perhaps it wasn't that it was entirely inferior to Heavenly Go, it was just different. Heavenly Go engaged your intelligence and abilities of prediction, in which you thought of where to move next before committing a step. Wang Yuhang was just moving, simple as that. He did whatever entered his mind, to surprisingly decent results.

His ability to move with such recklessness and survive almost made Han Sen reconsider whether he had good luck or bad luck.

"Han Sen, I beseech your aid once more. Death follows me at a very near distance, it mocks me. It tells me I will be in his company very soon if you do not help me right now!" Wang Yuhang continued to scream. By now, he had been running for over an hour, and the red of his eyes began to fade. The size of his horn reduced.

The benefits of his Angel Gene Fluid were quickly wearing away, and he wouldn't last much longer.

Seeing Wang Yuhang reach a valley, Han Sen thought it was time. He summoned Moment Queen and the little angel, and commanded them to tackle a super creature each. He himself went to engage the minotaur.

Moment Queen went up against the rock golem, and he commanded her to use speed to kite it away while he kited the minotaur.

Han Sen still depended on his little angel more than anything. She was currently possessed by the Steel-Knight King, which made her stronger than the average super creature. It made her more reliable to him now, as well. With her power, she'd be able to easily slay the wind-elemental bird.

And as suspected, the little angel did not disappoint Han Sen. Within a few moments of fighting, she had covered the bird's back with a number of lacerations and wounds. A whirlwind of loose feathers and blood formed in the sky as the bird struggled against its new foe. It would be killed very soon.

The strange bird cawed to the skies, as if it were sending an SOS signal to the nearby shelter. And when it did this, Han Sen's eyes looked murderous. His Flaming Rex Spike smacked into the minotaur's spear, like two geysers of fire colliding. Han Sen was knocked back two steps, not as strong as the minotaur.

The silver fox, who was perched on Han Sen's shoulder, suddenly opened its mouth and fired a thunderbolt at the minotaur.

Boom!

The advantage the minotaur had just gained on Han Sen quickly disappeared. As the minotaur was unable to follow-up with an additional attack, the silver fox saved its master by delivering an unavoidable bolt of lightning to the minotaur.
