<p>Boom!</p>
<p>The sword light was destroyed. After its destruction, a bloody
mist appeared in its absence. But that also faded away, as did the
presence of Han Sen and the two Zhao sisters. They were all
gone.</p>
<p>The many scary creatures of the 33 skies were shocked. Qin Xiu’s
sword was frightening. How could anyone not be afraid of that?</p>
<p>Although Han Sen was someone capable of defeating Bury Path God,
he could not block Qin Xiu’s sword light. And this made Bury Path
God and the other God Chaos Party members look ashen.</p>
<p>In an old tower, Qin Xiu’s eyes looked a little weird as he
said, “He broke the sword light. This man is interesting. It looks
like the black crystal armor chose to hide inside him for a
reason.”</p>
<p>Suddenly, Qin Xiu looked as if he was in pain. His body started
to shake as he tried to handle the pain. He stood where he was for
quite some time.</p>
<p>“He’s trying to get control back. It’s a shame that the things
in my hands cannot be reclaimed and controlled by others.” Qin Xiu
looked very tough. He let the pain spread, but he never moved.</p>
<p>On a small, nameless planet, Zhao Ning’er was looking more than
a little pale. Her white clothes were dyed red.</p>
<p>“Sister, are you okay?” Zhao Qiu Yi scrambled over to get a look
at Zhao Ning’er and asked about how she was faring. A worried look
was scrawled harshly across her face.</p>
<p>“I am fine.” Zhao Ning’er shook her head. She turned to look at
a shadow that was inside the cave along with them.</p>
<p>She was not all that injured. Her wounds were superficial. They
paled in comparison to the injuries of the person who was beside
her in the cave. Compared to his wounds, her injuries were
practically nothing.</p>
<p>Zhao Qiu Yi peered at Han Sen with profound worry. Her worry was
immense due to the state he was in compared to her sister. His
condition was very poor. After seeing him, there was nothing short
of what one might call scary.</p>
<p>Han Sen’s arms looked like they had exploded. He had massive
wounds everywhere. His body was like an open pomegranate. The only
good thing about it was the fact that Han Sen’s blood was
crystallized. It was frozen inside his veins, refusing to come
out.</p>
<p>“Is he still alive?” Zhao Qiu Yi looked at his body, unaware of
what she should do. Any other person who had been hit like that
would have died a million times over by now. He didn’t look
alive.</p>
<p>“I think he is still alive.” Zhao Ning’er was not so sure. There
was not one speck of Han Sen’s body that looked fine. Even all of
his organs were injured. It was like he had been blown up. No
organs were running normally inside his body.</p>
<p>But Han Sen’s presence had not faded away. Aside from that, he
looked like a dead man.</p>
<p>A white half-burned candle was burning on Han Sen’s head. If
Zhao Ning’er and Zhao Qiu Yi moved closer to Han Sen or the white
candle, their minds got messed up. Not even Zhao Ning’er could get
close. They did not know what that half-burned candle would do.</p>
<p>Zhao Ning’er knew the half-burned candle had flown out of Han
Sen’s body. Since it was something that belonged to Han Sen, they
did not think too much of it.</p>
<p>They could not see how scary the candle was. Otherwise, they
would not have dared to stand where they were.</p>
<p>The half-burned candle was on Han Sen’s forehead. The flame was
like a ghostly blue fire. It was like countless souls were crying
in the fire.</p>
<p>In the Qin Kingdom, people only knew this half-burned candle was
called Mirror Moon. It was able to revive people. They did not know
that the candle required souls to burn.</p>
<p>Where Mirror Moon was, if a creature died, their souls would be
attracted by the fire. They would not go to the geno hall to be
reborn. They vanished from the world.</p>
<p>Mirror Moon’s appearance there was not going to help Han Sen. It
had no connection to him. To the candle, Han Sen was just any other
creature. He might as well have been a dog or a cat. Mirror Moon
would not distinguish the two. It was just for storing food.</p>
<p>Mirror Moon flew out on its own because it felt Han Sen’s soul
leaving his body. That was why it had flown out. It was waiting for
the soul to be sucked into the light.</p>
<p>The soul had no form or texture. It was lighter than anything in
that world. When a spirit left its body, it flew out. It would
float into the geno hall.</p>
<p>The universe did not have a difference between high and low or
left and right, but the direction of the geno hall was up when it
came to spirits.</p>
<p>When people had a weak life force, their souls lost power and
would start to ascend.</p>
<p>Han Sen’s life force was very low and had reached that point. He
was practically a dead man. Despite that, his soul did not leave
his body.</p>
<p>Mirror Moon was waiting for Han Sen’s soul to leave, but it did
not.</p>
<p>Mirror Moon was confused by this. Its fire kept waving. It was
trying to draw Han Sen’s soul out of the lifeless body.</p>
<p>Usually, Mirror Moon would not do this. That was because spirits
were everywhere in the world. It did not need to do it. It did not
need to steal souls from a living creature.</p>
<p>In the universe, creatures could die any second. Countless
numbers of souls could be used at all times. But Han Sen’s soul was
very enticing for Mirror Moon.</p>
<p>His body was obviously dead, but his soul had yet to rise up.
The Mirror Moon candle’s flame blazed brighter. It had a weird blue
color. It attracted a lot of souls. It was trying to take Han Sen’s
soul.</p>
<p>If Zhao Ning’er and Zhao Qiu Yi could see souls, they would
notice the souls around the planet were going into the candle’s
fire like the tide of the sea. Many souls were being sucked into
the fire to burn. Crying noises were made, the likes of which could
make people’s teeth chatter.</p>
<p>But they did not see anything. They only felt the cold of the
cave give them goosebumps. The temperature of the cave, however,
was not cold.</p>
<p>No matter how much the Mirror Moon candle exploded and spirits
from another system came, Han Sen’s soul did not move.</p>
<p>Mirror Moon was so confused by this. It had lived for a billion
years, but it had not experienced this before. All creatures or
spirits were beings of freedom. When they lost their life force,
they would leave their own bodies. Han Sen’s body no longer had a
life force. Why his body did not ascend was a mystery Mirror Moon
was unable to grasp.</p>
<p>Mirror Moon was not human. It did not have emotions as humans
did. It would not be curious about why that was, but it felt Han
Sen’s spirit would help it. Because Mirror Moon could not attract
Han Sen’s soul, it went to Han Sen.</p>
<p>It had never taken a soul from a living thing before, but Han
Sen did not seem to be alive. So Mirror Moon wanted to try and take
his soul.</p>
<p>The candle landed atop Han Sen’s forehead. It was bloody. His
skull was cracked. One could see thick brain juice inside it.</p>
<p>After the candle was on it, there was a sizzling sound. It was
like skin getting burned by metal.</p>
