<h2>Geno Art in the Moonlight</h2>
<h3>Chapter 1862</h3>

<p>There was no use in watching the livestream now, because the
moonlight was like a curtain that obscured everything that lay
beyond.</p>
<p>Han Sen stood inside the palace. He could feel the moonlight
going into his skin. His bones and cells felt alive, as if they
were being thoroughly cleansed by blessed water.</p>
<p>“Weird. The power of that moonlight…” As Han Sen wondered about
all this, his Jadeskin started running.</p>
<p>The beams of moonlight drifted toward Han Sen and landed on him,
as if he were their exact target.</p>
<p>“Ah! They are the same element. That is why I felt that it was
similar to Jadeskin.” Han Sen was very happy about this. When the
moonlight came through him, his Jadeskin developed even faster.</p>
<p>When the Jadeskin had become xenogeneic, it looked as if it had
gone as far as it could possibly go. But now that he had the
benefit of the moonlight, it felt like it was going even further.
This made Han Sen incredibly happy.</p>
<p>When Han Sen absorbed that moonlight, the light wasn’t reduced.
In fact, the luminosity only increased. Within the moonlight, Han
Sen was also able to see some sort of text that stood out brighter
than the rest of the moon’s light.</p>
<p>When Han Sen read it, he noticed that it was a geno art.</p>
<p>But it did not have a title. So, Han Sen kept reading it, until
he realized that it was something quite similar to Jadeskin.</p>
<p>It had not been created by the same entity, but the thought
process behind it was surprisingly similar.</p>
<p>That geno art inside the moonlight was more suitable for the
geno universe. Jadeskin was tuned for the sanctuaries it originated
from, after all. It was impossible to tell which of the two was
flat-out better, and that was because the environment was
different.</p>
<p>“I am so lucky. I was thinking about how I could modify
Jadeskin, and now I have this. Although I cannot copy it directly,
it will be perfect if I can find a way to integrate it with
Jadeskin for now.” Han Sen was so happy, and he did his best to
memorize the content of the text he could see above.</p>
<p>There was more and more moonlight entering him, and it almost
started to feel like water. It was like a liquid, thickly flowing
into Han Sen.</p>
<p>Han Sen’s body was like jade now. He stood within the glow of
the moonlight like an ice statue, letting the moonlight penetrate
him. His delicate bones were cleansed by the moonlight, making him
as squeaky clean as any statue.</p>
<p>More and more moonlight bathed his body, until his xenogeneic
genes started to evolve.</p>
<p>“Am I going to become a Viscount now?” Han Sen was super happy
with the prospect of this. Although it was the xenogeneic gene of
Jadeskin that was evolving, it was still good enough for him.</p>
<p>Recently, Han Sen had been wondering about how he might make
himself a Viscount. And now it seemed that Jadeskin would be the
trigger.</p>
<p>Han Sen cast Jadeskin to absorb as much of the light as was
possible. He had to make sure that his body received as much as it
could. His other body parts were bathed in the moonlight, but what
benefitted him most was the xenogeneic body.</p>
<p>His jade-looking body began to glow with a halo. It was a sign
that he would soon become a Viscount. After becoming a Viscount,
Han Sen could unleash his xenogeneic powers through smoke, fire,
and light.</p>
<p>Jadeskin’s power could very well be a light-element one.</p>
<p>Outside of the Moon Palace, moons were rising. Every time a moon
rose, the Moon Palace would become brighter.</p>
<p>“I wonder how many moons he will be able to raise?” Yisha was
looking at the palace with a fond smile.</p>
<p>She did not expect that Han Sen would be able to raise many, as
he was essentially just there to practice. He was only a Baron, and
he only had knife powers. She didn’t expect he’d manage to do too
well.</p>
<p>With the Moon God power, it was very good for an outsider to be
able to raise twelve moons. The most a Rebate had ever raised was
thirty-six.</p>
<p>Han Sen was not a Rebate, so Yisha would be happy to see him
raise ten moons.</p>
<p>“You can fight to get a higher rank, but not more moons. Twelve
moons should be the max an outsider can achieve. Over the past few
hundred years, only four or five outsiders have ever been able to
raise twelve. The best managed to raise twenty-four,” Icebird Duke
said.</p>
<p>The Nobles and civilians were watching the moonrise keenly. They
kept counting, each time a new one rose.</p>
<p>One, two, three, four, five.</p>
<p>The moons kept rising, and there were now ten of them above the
palace. People were shocked.</p>
<p>“He managed to get ten moons! Han Sen is lucky,” Night River
King commented calmly. He was currently playing chess with
Black-Moon King.</p>
<p>Black-Moon King smiled and said, “I think he can do more than
that.”</p>
<p>“You think he can raise twelve?” Night River King said, after
moving one of his pieces.</p>
<p>“More than that, even.” Black-Moon King’s smile did not go
anywhere.</p>
<p>Night River King was shocked by the assumption, and so he asked
Black Moon King, “You think he can manage to raise more than twelve
moons?”</p>
<p>“I suppose,” Black-Moon King said.</p>
<p>“In the past few hundred years, only five outsiders have managed
to raise twelve. And there are tens of thousands of competitors
this year,” Night River King said.</p>
<p>“Knife Queen selected the boy as her student. She had a reason
for making that choice. It wouldn’t be all that surprising,”
Black-Moon King said.</p>
<p>“How about we make a wager? If Han Sen can exceed twelve moons,
I will give you my Dragon Steel. If he is unable to, you give me
the Steel Knife. Black Steel managed to get that Dragon Back Knife,
so you don’t need the Steel Knife.” Night River King smiled.</p>
<p>“Okay.” Black-Moon King simply agreed, and then put a black
chess piece down on the table.</p>
<p>Eleven moons had managed to rise. The next would be the twelfth.
To many of the Rebate, that would be the max he was expected to
achieve.</p>
