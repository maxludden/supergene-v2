<p>The core was terrifying and hot. Han Sen saw that the scary old vine had wreathed itself around the core. It created a giant orb-like object that replaced the shell of the core.</p>

<p>Many vines were coming out from the vine orb. Like a legion of dragons, they came at Han Sen. They made Han Sen accelerate his movements to avoid being struck.</p>

<p>Han Sen used the peacock king eye at its maximum potential. He looked through the vines and saw a glimpse of what might have lain inside. The high-temperature liquid inside had turned white. They were more like crystal. Within that liquid, Han Sen saw a weird fish that appeared to be sleeping. That fish looked white. It looked as if it was real, but it also looked as if it wasn’t real.</p>

<p>From the outside, the fish looked like an eel, but its body was longer than 3,000 feet. It was within the sphere of vines. Its lifeforce was active. It looked as if it was on the brink of waking up. Han Sen felt a very scary flame power arise from the fish’s body. Within its God Spirit presence, it was without a doubt a God Spirit Blood-Pulse that had been born inside the scary land pulse.</p>

<p>Han Sen wanted to rush in there, but he noticed the vine orb had more than just a white fish. A gourd was hanging between the vines and above the fish’s head.</p>

<p>That gourd was about half the size of an average person. It was snow-white like a crystal. It was hanging right above the fish’s head. It looked like a small gourd pendant. When Han Sen had a closer look, he was hit by a wave of pending danger. He felt as if that gourd was far more intimidating than the God Spirit Blood – Pulse fish. What Han Sen thought was even more strange, though, was that the gourd, which had no eyes, appeared to be staring at him. It certainly weirded him out.</p>

<p>Han Sen kept dodging the attacks of the vines while examining what he could see. Within the giant, old vine was that gourd.</p>

<p>The gourd seemed to be absorbing the power of the God Spirit Blood-Pulse fish. A light came out from where the gourd touched the fish’s head and melted into the gourd.</p>

<p>“That thing is absorbing a God Spirit Blood-Pulse.” Han Sen stopped hesitating. He found an opening and rushed toward the sphere of vines.</p>

<p>A gene race that had evolved to that level could not be tamed. Letting it absorb all the God Spirit Blood-Pulse was a waste. Han Sen did not enter the vine orb yet. He suddenly saw the gourd release a scary white flame. The entire gourd shone like a sun.</p>

<p>Pang!</p>

<p>Light shone on Han Sen’s body was. It felt as if his body was inside a sun stove. Even with the strength of his body and the power of the gold wing peacock king’s power, he could not block the effects of that heat. The feathers of the peacock wings on his back smoldered. His hair was singed. His blonde hair erupted in flames. His eyebrows and eyelashes were burning.</p>

<p>Han Sen suddenly broke the rules of the world. He was forced to use power to wipe the flames off his body and quickly fly back. The fire the gourd had shot out was too scary. It was probably at the same level as an Annihilation God Spirit. Just one flame was as good as Moment God.</p>

<p>If there had been no restriction on his power by the rules that governed that world, Han Sen should have been able to withstand what the gourd threw at him. Now, he was in shackles. If he needed to use all of his power, he could only do so for a short amount of time. He had to face the prospect that he might not be able to do take on the gourd.</p>

<p>He did not dare break the rules of the world either. Han Sen used his power and stopped it. After leaving the vine orb, he used the power of his gold wing peacock king to break the lava and fly.</p>

<p>Han Sen did not plan on giving up though. He circled the vine ball and flew fast. He wanted to find the gourd’s weak point so he could potentially kill it with one hit.</p>

<p>That thing was very scary. Even if Han Sen used his Xuan Yellow Sutra, he did not have the confidence he could turn it into an egg. Still, he was going to try his best.</p>

<p>Before Han Sen did anything, he saw the lava suddenly erupt with big movement. The scary body of a human broke the high-temperature liquid and arrived. It was near the orb of vines.</p>

<p>Han Sen looked over and saw a strong elder wearing black and white armor. Behind him, there was a halo that looked like Yin and Yang. It was spinning. It was like some god’s god light.</p>

<p>The Yin and Yang tai chi light spun. Countless vines headed toward him. The old man did nothing. The vines were pushed back by the Yin and Yang tai chi light.</p>

<p>“Is he Sky King?” Han Sen was able to guess who the person likely might have been.</p>

<p>Sky King had inherited an Annihilation God Spirit Blood-Pulse. The Annihilation God Spirit was Sky God. Legends claimed he was a God Spirit who controlled the sky and ground. He had Yin and Yang, which were two air powers.</p>

<p>Now, Sky King had combined with Sky God. He had an Annihilation God Spirit power, or perhaps something even stronger.</p>

<p>After all, Sky King had accepted an Annihilation God Spirit’s power and combined with a gene race’s power a long time ago, so he must have had many exclusive gene races by now.</p>

<p>Sky King could not be too good with eye powers. He did not see Han Sen from a distance. He went straight to the vine orb. He must have gone there for the God Spirit Blood-Pulse.</p>

<p>“Let him fight first. I want to see what the gourd’s powers can do.” Han Sen’s heart jumped. He gave up trying to steal the God Spirit Blood-Pulse for now. He used his peacock king eye to observe the scene. Sky King was extremely strong. He immediately reached the point where Han Sen had been. The gourd released light that was like a sun.</p>

<p>Sky King coldly grunted, but the Yin and Yang tai chi light covered his body. The fire was unable to break the shield of the two airs, Yin and Yang. Seeing Sky King rush into the sphere of vines, the gourd mutated. A scary white light flame exploded. It turned into a three-foot gold sunbird that roared at Sky King.</p>

<p>Sky King’s face looked very serious. He punched the three-foot gold sunbird. It released god light like a sun. His strong Yang power was no weaker than the gourd.</p>

<p>Pang!</p>

<p>The three-foot gold sunbird was blown up by Sky King’s gene combine skill, Sun God Punch, but the punching light of Sun God Punch exploded too. In the next second, the sun-like gourd had many three-foot gold sunbirds come flying out. They had sun god flames that fired into the sky. To Sky King, they had turned into a scary flock of crows.</p>

<p>Sky King was like a reborn battle god. He kept throwing out Sun God Punches. He blew up many of the three-foot gold sunbirds. He was still able to slay amidst that flock.</p>

<p>He was surrounded by a flock of birds. Sky King could not get to the God Spirit Blood-Pulse fish.</p>

<p>Sky King also seemed to be afraid of something. He did not delay for too long. Suddenly, his hands glowed with a god light. One hand was like a sun in the air, and one hand was like a moon lighting up the ground.</p>

<p>His fists punched each other to create a scary black hole that sucked all the lava and three-foot gold sunbirds into it. The three-foot gold sunbirds could not fight back. They were swiftly consumed by the black hole. Sky King used this window of opportunity. Like a bolt of lightning, he hurried to the orb of vines. He was going straight for the God Spirit Blood-Pulse fish.</p>
