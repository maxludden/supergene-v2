  On his way to Planet Wind Zone, Han Sen sent a coded message.

Han Sen took a deep breath before typing in the number that he wanted to send the message to. It was the number that Mister White had given him.

Mister White had told him that if there was an emergency, he could send a coded message to that number. Then, he would find a way to contact Han Sen back.

The code was simple. Rather than explaining exactly what had happened, Han Sen simply said that there was an emergency.

After sending the message, Han Sen waited patiently. Half an hour later, his communicator came to life. An unknown number had sent him a message.

Han Sen opened it. Again, this message was written in code. Han Sen read it and understood what he was being told.

“Go along with it. The information you need is in his house, and you must go there tonight,” Han Sen read, and his jaw hit the floor. Mister White knew that Han Sen had killed Bai Yi, and on top of that, he knew that Han Sen was currently disguising himself as Bai Yi. When the message said “his house,” it must have been referring to Bai Yi’s home.

Even with his coded message translated, no one would know what the message was referring to.

Although he didn’t know how Mister White had found out, Mister White wanted him to keep pretending. And that meant he might succeed with the ruse.

The information Mister White was alluding to had to be information concerning Bai Yi. If Han Sen managed to get that information, he might learn more about Bai Yi. And that would make the charade easier for him.

The major problem at the moment was that he didn’t know anything about Bai Yi. He currently didn’t even know where the man lived. He didn’t know if anyone else lived in the man’s home or if he had any friends. He didn’t have a single clue. If he just went there boldly, Han Sen feared his identity would be exposed.

And as for the information Mister White was talking about, Han Sen didn’t know where to find it.

When Han Sen arrived back at Planet Wind Zone, Mister White hadn’t sent any more follow-up messages. He had already given Han Sen all the help he would be able to. Now, Han Sen just had to do whatever he could.

Han Sen looked up some information on Bai Yi, but what he found wasn’t very detailed. He was King Bai’s sixteenth son. He was good at manipulating water, and he was a very arrogant man. His mother was a Siren, but she had died many years ago.

Han Sen felt relieved. If Bai Yi’s mother was still around, she would probably have exposed Han Sen the moment he met her.

And in regards to King Bai, Han Sen wasn’t really worried. King Bai had many children and grandchildren. Aside from the ones that he truly cherished, few ever saw him.

Bai Yi wasn’t one of the favored children. The Siren civilization had been destroyed, and Bai Yi’s mother had run to the Extreme King afterward. King Bai made her one of his wives. Bai Yi had no one living to support him, so he was just a run-of-the-mill prince.

Bai Yi’s talent wasn’t too shabby, but he wasn’t very famous amongst the princes. His temper was foul, and he was a very arrogant individual. He was greedy, too. He didn’t have much, and he wasn’t fond of his father, either. Because of that, his development was stunted.

Although Bai Yi was older than Bai Wei, he hadn’t actually gone much farther than she had. His planet had helped him become King class, but that was about it. There were no more resources that would allow him to get better.

That was all Han Sen was able to learn. As for who was on Bai Yi’s planet and what friends he might have had, that was information he couldn’t learn on the internet.

And as for what the planet looked like and what sort of buildings were there, Han Sen hadn’t a clue. He hadn’t seen a single image of the place.

When he arrived on Planet Wind Zone, Han Sen ran to where the blood kirin was living. Bai Wei was currently still practicing in King’s Garden, so she wasn’t on Planet Wind Zone right then. Han Sen gathered Bao’er, the blood kirin, and the little red bird, then they left the planet and took a ship to Bai Yi’s Planet Water Zone.

Planet Water Zone lived up to its name. The whole planet was covered in water, or at least most of it was. A few islands were visible, but they were easy to overlook.

There were many creatures living in its sea, and Bai Yi’s water element body was a good match for practicing there. Overall, it was a pretty nice planet.

But Han Sen didn’t see any towns on the planet’s surface. He surmised that it must have been underwater.

Han Sen was growing nervous. He didn’t know where to find Bai Yi’s underwater city. If he just randomly started poking around, he’d look like a pretty shady character.

If he was Bai Yi, there was no way he would have forgotten the way home. He wouldn’t just dive into the sea and swim around aimlessly.

Han Sen entered Planet Water Zone’s atmosphere, trying to figure out what he should do. Suddenly, someone jumped out of the water to greet Han Sen.

“Who are you? Why have you come to Planet Water Zone?” the person shouted at Han Sen.

Han Sen looked at the woman, taking in her blue hair and unusual body. The lady didn’t look like one of the Extreme King. Her ears were like the blue gills of a fish. She had no proper legs, either. Her lower body was the tail of a fish. She looked like one of the Ghana, but just a bit different.

“This must be one of the Siren,” Han Sen thought to himself.

“You don’t remember your prince?” Han Sen shouted coldly. He used his Original Water King Body and cast a water area-of-effect to bind the Siren lady and pull her towards him.

“My prince… is that you?” The Siren lady’s eyes opened wide. She looked at Han Sen in shock. “My prince! You used Return to Origin?”

“If you know that I have, then do not waste my time. Hurry down and tidy up. I’m going to need some privacy for a while as I take over the body,” Han Sen said. Then, he released the water AoE and let the Siren lady go free.

The Siren lady looked frightened, and she said, “Yes, I will do it.”

After that, she flicked her tail and went swimming back into the depths of the sea.

Han Sen silently followed her. He swam into the ocean and soon saw an underwater city residing beneath the waves. It was like something out of a fairytale.

The entire city was wrapped in a holy blue light that separated it from the water. It looked rather amazing.

“Of course. The environment here is far better than the environment of Planet Wind Zone,” Han Sen thought to himself. He followed the girl into the underwater city.

Surprisingly, when he entered, he found that the pretty underwater city was actually dirty and full of garbage. Many buildings were run-down and dilapidated.

Millions could have lived in that underwater city, but when he entered the city proper, there was no one living there aside from the Siren lady, whose name was Lilly.

“It looks like this Prince Sixteen wasn’t living a good life, either,” Han Sen thought to himself.
