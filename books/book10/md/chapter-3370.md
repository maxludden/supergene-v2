  “Is Qin Xiu mad? What did he do to Wan’er?” Han Sen frowned. Based on the way Qin Xiu supposedly loved Wan’er, the man should not have done anything that would negatively impact Wan’er.

What was happening to Wan’er now was far too weird. He could not think of a reason as to why Qin Xiu would turn Wan’er into something like this.

Han Sen did not know that since he had turned Wan’er into the black-haired mode, Wan’er had been missing Han Sen a lot. She consistently spoke highly about Han Sen in his absence.

Qin Xiu did not say anything about it to her. He remained very gentle toward Wan’er, but he still used some intense methods to make her revert to her blonde mode.

Qin Xiu was going to finish Han Sen off so that he could be the sole recipient of Wan’er’s love. He was unable to accept her holding someone else more important than him in their heart.

Wan’er was now floating in the air. The back of her wings were shaking. She put her hands together. She looked like a praying angel.

Wan’er’s face had no depiction of faith or liveliness. She stared at Han Sen and looked at him in an extremely cold way. When she put her hands together, a strange sort of light manifested. It did not belong to her Super God Spirit body or her reverse Super God Spirit body.

“Is that a Break World power? That does not seem right.” Han Sen looked at Wan’er’s hands and felt a weird power moving.

After his Super God Spirit body managed to break the world, it had become a pure Super Spirit God body that could not break anything in the world. He would, however, not receive damage from anything in the world.

The power in Wan’er’s hands was not a spirit power. Even so, it still had elements of the Super God Spirit body’s power and elements of the reverse Super God Spirit body’s power.

“Does a Super God Spirit body have another way of breaking the world?” Han Sen looked at Wan’er’s hands with intrigue. Her hands, he noted, were strongly glowing.

This power was almost transparent, but it was not a spirit power. Upon looking at Wan’er’s hands, he saw that there was a transparent sort of power rising.

After her hands adopted this sort of transparent power, they turned crystal-clear. When the transparent power started to spread, her entire body, including the light wings behind her, took on the form of transparent crystals.

Wan’er now looked like a transparent crystal statue. It was only her eyes that were different. They had remained black.

If one did not look closer, one would have thought she was just a pair of strange black eyes floating in the air. It was only after looking closer that would one see her body was transparent.

“Does the Super God Spirit body have another way of breaking the world?” Han Sen was incredibly shocked by what he was witnessing. Wan’er was breaking the world, and she was breaking the world in a completely different way. The two of them had both used a Super God Spirit body to break the world, yet two different Super God Spirit powers were created.

Han Sen did not know if his Super God Spirit body’s Break World power was correct or if it was hers. Either way, Wan’er was releasing a scary presence that put Han Sen on high alert.

When Wan’er parted her hands, Han Sen felt a flare of goosebumps overwhelm his body. He quickly sensed that something bad was going to happen. He did not hesitate. He immediately engaged his Super God Spirit body’s Break World mode. He put on his Break World body.

In the next moment, Han Sen saw Wan’er’s hand on his chest. She was so fast that he had been unable to dodge her move.

Han Sen was watching that nearly transparent, weird hand thrust through his chest. It went right through his body.

When Wan’er pulled back her hand, Han Sen noticed a hole had been created in his spirit body. He had been severely damaged.

“Her Break World power can even deal harm to my pure spirit body.” Han Sen quickly moved his body. While he was moving, the damaged spirit body reverted to normal.

Wan’er looked at Han Sen weirdly. In the next moment, her strange body moved again.

This time, Han Sen was prepared. He peered at her body with an intense gaze, hoping to be able to predict her next attack.

Even so, when Wan’er raised her hand, it once again fired through Han Sen’s body.

Han Sen now knew that he couldn’t avoid Wan’er’s attacks. He ignored his damaged spirit body, gathered up all of his power, and tried to throw a punch at Wan’er’s strange body.

Han Sen felt his fist thrust into what felt like liquid. There was so much resistance that it was like he was punching a rock. When his fist went inside Wan’er’s body, he felt that her body was very soft. It was even boneless. It was like he had shoved his fist into water.

Boom!

Han Sen wanted to pull his fist back out and try to attack other parts of Wan’er’s body, but he suddenly felt as if he had been electrified. His spirit body was numb and paralyzed. He then felt a force of suction grip him by the fist. He could not draw his fist out of Wan’er’s body.

The strangest part about all of this was that Wan’er’s seemed to be in the same condition as Han Sen. Her body was shaking as if she was being electrified. Her hand, which had been forced through Han Sen’s chest, could not be withdrawn.

As Qin Xiu watched this scene, his expression became very strange. He asked aloud, “What is happening here? Han Sen’s Break World power and Wan’er’s Break World power has created a weird rhythm.”

Not even Qin Xiu knew what was going on. He had taken the black crystal ring from the black crystal armor. He used the black crystal ring’s gene prototype’s power to make Wan’er break the world.

After Wan’er managed to break the world, she was exceptionally strong. Not even Qin Xiu would have dared underestimate what she was now capable of. He thought Wan’er could defeat Han Sen easily without any trouble.

Who would have expected that Han Sen’s Break World power would create a rhythm alongside Wan’er’s Break World power and that this was also going to affect Wan’er? She was just like Han Sen. She had been robbed of her ability to fight.

“Sky King, open the path to Burning Red Sky.” Qin Xiu did not want Wan’er to experience any danger. He gave up on the idea of letting Wan’er deal with Han Sen. He was going to go to Burning Red Sky to deal with Han Sen himself.

Before Sky King was able to answer, something weird started happening in Burning Red Sky. Han Sen and Wan’er’s bodies were combining.

They were both in front of each other, but their bodies drew closer until they started merging. Face to face like Siamese twins, their bodies kept merging.
