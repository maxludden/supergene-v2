<p>God seemed to understand what Han Sen was thinking and coldly said, &#8220;It is futile. Have you heard of representing general trends? The general means nature like how fire does not have a shape. You cannot see the wind. Water can flow. Every substance has its own nature. Once you catch that nature, whatever chances come will never leave it. It seems like there are a lot of changes, but in the end, it will always return to its nature.&#8221;</p>

<p>Han Sen knew what God was saying. It meant Very High Leader was originally an emotionless person. No matter what Han Sen did, he could not change who he was. He also could not change the situation they were in.</p>

<p>&#8220;How do you know if he is fire or wind or water?&#8221; Han Sen did not agree with what God was saying. He turned his eyes, looked at God, and noticed Very High Leader, who was next to God, was petrified. His body had a rhythm. It was like his entire body was connected to the sky, ground, and universe.</p>

<p>Actually, one could say they were combined. It seemed like Very High Leader had become a part of the universe. He was a part of the universe&#8217;s machine.</p>

<p>The feeling was increasing. It made Very High Leader&#8217;s presence become colder and colder. It was like he was not a sensitive creature of high intelligence. He was just a cold machine.</p>

<p>Surprisingly, God did not object to what Han Sen said and said something that could mean two things. &#8220;I want to know if he is fire, wind, or water too.&#8221;</p>

<p>Han Sen did not understand what God meant, but it seemed as if Very High Leader understood him. His Very High Sense mind had become stronger. It kept increasing over a short time. He was almost as strong as a butterfly deified now.</p>

<p>Although it was just his mind increasing, his body was still primitive class. It was still enough for his heart to change.</p>

<p>Han Sen thought, Even Very High Leader has reached Very High Forget Love level. There is no need for him to keep the butterfly lady around. Plus, he cannot defeat the butterfly lady.</p>

<p>Although Han Sen had a way that could enable him to get things over with and end the entire bet, with God near, that method was difficult to achieve.</p>

<p>&#8220;It does not matter how much you think. Why don&#8217;t you just gamble with your luck? Sit back and see if he is fire, water, or wind?&#8221; God smiled at Han Sen as he spoke.</p>

<p>&#8220;Could you at least tell me what the original ending was like?&#8221; Han Sen asked God.</p>

<p>&#8220;If he chose the small love and the small relationship, how could he end up becoming the leader of the Very High? You should have known that,&#8221; God said.</p>

<p>Han Sen nodded. In fact, he had already guessed this. He still thought Very High Leader would not kill the butterfly lady so soon. But things were always unpredictable. This was now a gamble that hinged on his luck.</p>

<p>No. You cannot gamble with luck. To use luck when gambling against God, even if I gambled 10,000 times, I would not win once. I need to find a strategy that can ensure my victory. Han Sen&#8217;s brain spun fast. He could not think of a way in a short amount of time.</p>

<p>With God near, using force would not work. But he was not God, so he could not control the wills and the ways of someone&#8217;s heart. That was much harder for him to win.</p>

<p>Han Sen wanted to question him, so he asked. &#8220;Can you tell me how Han Jingzhi won?&#8221;</p>

<p>God went silent for a moment but surprisingly said, &#8220;He did not do anything. He only made the right choice. Therefore, he won.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;So, you are saying he won a gamble through luck?&#8221; Han Sen did not believe that.</p>

<p>God nodded and said, &#8220;It really was that way.&#8221;</p>

<p>Han Sen did not believe that was how Han Jingzhi won. He thought this might be God trying to lure him in and gamble via his luck.</p>

<p>&#8220;What did you guys gamble on before? Were you also judging a creature&#8217;s fate?&#8221; Han Sen asked. He was trying to gather more information.</p>

<p>&#8220;Not just one,&#8221; God replied. &#8220;There were 11.&#8221;</p>

<p>Han Sen&#8217;s heart jumped. Eleven? That number is very close to the number of people there were on the seventh team. Does that mean&#8230;</p>

<p>Han Sen held the excitement in his heart. He smiled and said, &#8220;You guys were able to gamble like that. If I knew we could gamble like that, I would have selected a few more. It would have given me more chances to win.&#8221;</p>

<p>God shook its head and said, &#8220;We gambled 11 rounds. If he lost one round, he was to become my slave. But he did not lose a single round.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Han Jingzhi won 11 rounds? What did you guys gamble about? How could he win so easily?&#8221; Han Sen asked with shock.</p>

<p>He could not imagine Han Jingzhi winning 11 rounds against God. Han Sen was having a hard enough time beating God once.</p>

<p>&#8220;We gambled that 11 humans would make a wish to me,&#8221; God said. &#8220;He said 10 people would make a wish and one would not. He was correct. Only one human he chose did not make a wish to me.&#8221; It did not sound like God was ashamed of losing the bet.</p>

<p>Han Sen&#8217;s heart was jumping like it was insane. That is right. They must have been the people from the seventh team. The one who did not make a wish was Gu Qingcheng.</p>

<p>Han Sen still could not imagine how Han Jingzhi was able to guess those wishes. Who would make a wish, and who would not make a wish?</p>

<p>According to the theory, if Han Jingzhi guessed the people who would make a wish, God would not try and tempt them. Regarding the person Han Jingzhi thought would not make a wish, God would try and tempt them.</p>

<p>In this situation, Han Jingzhi guessed them all correctly. That was too weird.</p>

<p>Han Sen remembered the Ning family&#8217;s second father used to say that Han Jingzhi told him not to make a wish, but second father still made a wish. How did Han Jingzhi guess that?</p>

<p>While Han Sen was talking to God, Very High Leader&#8217;s eyes opened wide. This time, Very High Leader was like a completely different person.</p>

<p>Although his face and body did not look different and his power had not increased, his presence felt totally different. It made him look like a completely different person.</p>

<p>Every movement of the Very High made Han Sen feel weird. It was like he had seen this somewhere before, but it was not the same.</p>

<p>Suddenly, Han Sen was shocked. This presence&#8230; Why does it look like the guy who calls himself God&#8230; hm&#8230; Aside from this God in front of me&#8230; He looks like the guy called Qing Jun.</p>

<p>Han Sen was checking out Very High Leader. They looked so similar, but it was just the presence that was similar. There was a difference.</p>

<p>If Very High Sense is practiced to mastery, do people become like those gods? Han Sen guessed. I think that must be right. Every elite of a race that goes into the geno hall becomes like those gods.</p>

<p>Han Sen was still thinking when Very High Leader looked at him and said, &#8220;The gamble between us has finished here. I will take it as a loss.&#8221;</p>

<p>When Han Sen heard that, he knew Very High Leader had already escaped the mental struggle he had found himself in.</p>

<p>After saying that, Very High Leader walked over to the butterfly lady.</p>
