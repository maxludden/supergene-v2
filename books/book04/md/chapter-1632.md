The professional in the virtual community got stomped on. Everyone commented and asked for his opinion on how Dollar effortlessly broke the fifth opponent’s head.

“Your prediction was accurate, and Dollar really was given a lot of trouble—the blood must have taken ages to clean!”

“Blowing up his head in less than a minute must have been really difficult”

“This is worrisome. It was such a big creature, think of all the meat! I don’t know if we should bake, grill, or boil it!”

“Of course, we can actually prepare it in ten different ways. We can fry it, stir-fry it, steam it, roast it, deep-fry it, slow-cook it, put it in sauce, flamethrower it, nuke it, or just barbecue it”

“The professional said Dollar wouldn’t get past the seventh round. This is great!”

The professional didn’t respond, but after a while, he departed and left behind a single note. It said Dollar was guaranteed not to make it past the seventh round. It made everyone go crazy once again.

In the Fourth God’s Sanctuary, all the beings were trying to find out what element Dollar was attuned with.

The sealing power hadn’t worked on him, and he seemed absolutely perfect in every way. He had no known flaw. It gave the others who wanted the title Son of God a headache.

Many super elites investigated these events, but they could not find anything. But they were able to confirm that the pipe Han Sen used was the Blow Blood geno core from Drink Blood Emperor.

That confirmed the sealing power did not work on Dollar. Blow Blood geno core had been sealed, and over the years, none had been able to unseal it. Yet, when Dollar had it, he had somehow been able to do just that.

Now people were able to confirm that the Dollar geno core they had witnessed was actually the Dollar geno core on the leaderboard, and it belonged to Dollar.

Everyone was talking about this, in fervent wonder about who might actually be able to stop Dollar.

People investigated Dollar’s list of battles painstakingly, and aside from Aqua Sun Beast, Dollar would go up against Jade Shura on the seventh round.

Jade Shura’s performance was outstanding. She hadn’t beaten beat Six Paths and Aqua Sun Beast like Han Sen had, but she was great nonetheless. Especially since she had Falsified-Sky powers. That was something many beings were flat-out afraid of.

It was a shame Godslayer Luo hadn’t decided to join in, but nobody dared to ask him to compete. Still, that meant the connection between him and Jade Shura would to remain a complete mystery.

People assumed she was the Queen of the Shura, a conclusion drawn from both her body shape and name. Still, people did not know why the queen possessed the Falsified-Sky powers.

Because her identity made things mysterious, it heightened the allure of the seventh match. And all wished to find out which of the two would end up stronger.

When calculating the odds from a simple power perspective, the results favored Dollar. But Falsified-Sky powers never missed. That power could very well kill Dollar in a second flat. Regardless, all the beings were extremely excited for the upcoming match.

The beings that would later go up against the victor of the match paid extra attention to it, as well. It did not matter who won, as long as they could learn a thing or two.

Inside the shura palace, a young shura lady stood next to the Shura Queen. If Han Sen saw who this woman was, he’d have been shocked.

That was because this shura lady looked just like Zero. She was obviously older than Zero, but she was practically the same in all other physical aspects.

“Ming’er, you need to be careful tomorrow. That Dollar is… unusual.” The shura queen spoke to the young shura.

“Mother, do not worry. I will beat him. And I will rise to take first place. I will tell everyone that Jade Shura is the greatest of all creations.” Yu Ming’er spoke with absolute confidence.

The Shura Queen laughed. She held her hands and said, “You cannot be careless. Our Falsified-Sky powers still possess flaws. Until we obtain the second half of the Falsified-Sky Sutra, it will never be perfect.”

“I know. But do not worry. The deal for the next ten years will result in me beating Luo Haitang, and then, I will obtain the second half of the Falsified-Sky Sutra,” Yu Ming’er said.

The Shura Queen shook her head. She knew her daughter well, and she knew the girl wouldn’t listen.

But the Shura Queen wasn’t too worried. Yu Ming’er was the most talented person in Jade Shura to have learned the Falsified-Sky Sutra. She was so strong, and there was no need to be concerned with her safety.

Even if she was unable to win, she could still survive whatever came her way.

Han Sen, meanwhile, was investigating something he was holding. After killing Aqua Sun Beast, he didn’t get the beast soul. But he did obtain the dead body, geno core, and Life Geno Essence.

Life Geno Essences were now useless for him, and he gave the meat to Little Silver and the others. He brought the geno core with him, though.

A green jade orb with a weird symbol of light. It contained a strong sealing power, that much was certain.

If other people did not have a sealing power, they could not make use of the orb. And it was at times like this, the benefit of Han Sen’s collection of spirit geno points really showed. Han Sen did not possess the power of sealing, but with the sealing spirit geno points, he could simulate sealing powers to make use of the orb.

The orb was useful, and if monsters were touched by the sealing light, even a super-class Little Star would end up stunned.

“This is good stuff.” Han Sen played around with the orb and came to like it.

It was called the God Orb, but it was not perfect. If Little Star was traveling, the God Orb would not be able to shine on him,for example. The sealing light could also be blocked by objects, such as shields.

But still, even if a shield was deflecting the sealing light, the shield itself would end up getting sealed. This applied to armor, as well. If the armor was sealed, your body would be locked in place.

Han Sen took the God Orb and returned to Divinity’s Bout. The sixth enemy conceded, a move prompted by witnessing Aqua Sun Beast’s merciless execution.

So, Han Sen exited the background and waited for the seventh match. He was curious about the Jade Shura.
