<h2>Red Copper Palace</h2>
<h3>Chapter 1924</h3>

<p>Han Sen tried to simulate the energy flow of the little minks.
He could do this by transforming the Dongxuan Sutra’s power into
the power the little minks possessed.</p>
<p>Han Sen didn’t think it’d be difficult to do, as the little
minks had only just been born. But it actually took Han Sen seven
or eight days to simulate their energy.</p>
<p>Around this time, the little minks got hungry. They came out to
eat again. After every meal, they returned to the red mist orb.
They always tried to enter the red copper palace, but they failed
each time.</p>
<p>Seeing the little minks going back into the red mist orb, Han
Sen finally finished simulating their powers. He then tried to put
the new energy into the red mist orb.</p>
<p>When the power hit the red mist orb, Han Sen felt the red mist
orb respond, as if it had a weird power of its own. It sucked Han
Sen right inside.</p>
<p>Dong!</p>
<p>The red mist orb fell on the floor, and Han Sen had entered it.
He could see a lot of red mist, in addition to the big red copper
palace.</p>
<p>Han Sen walked through the mist and headed straight for that
elusive palace. The seven minks kept on looping around the palace,
unable to find an access point that would grant them entry.</p>
<p>Seeing Han Sen, the seven little minks looked surprised. They
surrounded Han Sen, jumping and screaming. They then ran for the
main door.</p>
<p>They lined up. Some of them used their claws to push, some of
them used their bellies to push, and some of them used their backs
to push. They tried their hardest to push against the door, but it
wouldn’t budge.</p>
<p>Tzi! Tzi!</p>
<p>The little guys pushed so hard to no avail, then turned their
attention to Han Sen to ask for his help.</p>
<p>Han Sen had seen things like this many times before. If the
seven minks wanted to enter that place so badly, there must be
something valuable inside.</p>
<p>He didn’t hesitate. He placed his hand against the door and
pushed with the minks, trying to force it open.</p>
<p>But the door was like stone. Han Sen tried his best to get it to
move, but it wouldn’t budge an inch.</p>
<p>Han Sen looked at the door and found no indication of a lock. He
frowned.</p>
<p>“Tzi! Tzi! Tzi! Tzi!” The little minks kept pointing at
something, trying to tell him something.</p>
<p>“What are you saying?” Han Sen looked at them, but he could not
speak their language. He couldn’t understand them.</p>
<p>Luckily, the Dongxuan Aura could allow him to read minds, at
least a little. The minks kept on running and pointing, and
eventually, he heard a sound. It was a simple sound, but Han Sen
could guess what they meant.</p>
<p>Han Sen tried pushing the door again, but this time, he used the
little minks’ power to do so. He was simulating them, yes, but he
could still use the energy flow far better than the minks
themselves could. When he pushed, the red copper door slowly
opened.</p>
<p>The little minks were delighted. They lined up and helped Han
Sen push.</p>
<p>The door was opening slowly, and when the opening reached one
foot wide, the seven minks could not wait any longer. They
hurriedly shuffled themselves inside. Han Sen couldn’t wait either,
and so he squeezed in through the gap. And on the inside, the
palace really shocked Han Sen.</p>
<p>Han Sen immediately noted how elegant the place had looked from
the outside. It had led him to believe that it was some sort of
ancient relic, but now that he was looking at the interior, the
palace was shining with lights. It looked very scientific. It was
different from what he was expecting.</p>
<p>The seven minks ran inside the palace as Han Sen followed. There
were many strange tools and gizmos, and he felt as if he was
entering the research quarters of some alien base.</p>
<p>Han Sen saw there was a large throne inside the palace, though.
There was a ten-meter-tall machine sitting on it, curiously enough.
It looked like an old model of Alliance warframe. It was so old
that it looked like a medieval knight. It was clad in heavy armor
and everything.</p>
<p>Upon further inspection, Han Sen realized that the knight did
not have any electrical devices attached to it. It was built from
what he assumed to be red copper. It sat on the throne, and it gave
no indication of possessing a life force. Even so, it gave the
threatening feeling that it could get up and fight whenever it
wished to.</p>
<p>The seven little minks raced under its feet, then they climbed
its copper body until they reached the heart. They pushed and
squealed. What they were doing was anyone’s guess.</p>
<p>Boom!</p>
<p>Amidst Han Sen’s confusion and wonder, the knight did indeed
stand up off the throne. It lurched to its feet with a jerking
movement and shook the minks off of its body.</p>
<p>In the knight’s empty eyes, a red light started to gleam. The
light looked like some sort of warning beacon. Near the knight’s
heart, the red light grew stronger. It fired a red light towards
the red minks, and all seven of them disappeared.</p>
<p>And then, Han Sen saw the knight start to move. It was
approaching him quickly. Its red copper body gave off a sense of
foreboding.</p>
<p>And shortly after, it was right next to Han Sen. It reached out
its big hand and tried to pick Han Sen up.</p>
<p>Han Sen frowned, and so he quickly retreated and evaded the
hand’s grip. But the armored knight bent its legs and unleashed a
horrible power. It suddenly accelerated forward and ran before Han
Sen.</p>
<p>Han Sen was shocked. He used the Jadeskin’s godlight to punch
against the knight’s hand. A metal noise rang out following the
collision, but the knight was not hurt. Han Sen’s hand, however,
was left feeling numb.</p>
<p>Han Sen summoned his rabbit shoes and evaded the knight’s hand
that was coming for him again. He thought the armored knight could
not catch up with him.</p>
<p>But the knight’s speed increased again, and it actually revealed
itself to be faster than the rabbit shoes. It caught up with Han
Sen way too quickly, and Han Sen was unable to dodge. It simply
grabbed Han Sen’s body as easily as one would a doll.</p>
<p>Han Sen was shocked, but it was then that he realized the
knight’s hand was not exerting force. It put Han Sen in its palm
and did not hurt him.</p>
<p>The knight’s hand moved near its heart. That was where the
little minks had been sucked into.</p>
<p>Han Sen simulated the power of the little minks and then placed
his hand against the knight’s heart. Quickly, the knight’s heart
lit up again. The light shone on Han Sen, drawing him in.</p>
