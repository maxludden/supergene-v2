<h2>Decision</h2>
<h3>Chapter 2607</h3>

<p>Sky Palace Leader allowed Han Sen to go home and think the
matter over. He could inform the leader once he had come to a
decision.</p>
<p>“If I go, it will save me three years of healing. I will also be
given the support of the Very High. It is a great deal. But I will
risk exposing my true identity. If I don’t go, nothing bad will
happen, but it will take me some time to heal. And while I’m
healing, there won’t be much I can do to further myself. My ability
to practice will be suspended, and I will have to locate my own
resources.” Han Sen was deep in thought the whole way home,
wondering what he should do.</p>
<p>After a while of deliberation, he decided to stay in Sky Palace.
His recovery would only take a short time, anyway. And he could get
his own resources. It would just be a slower process.</p>
<p>But if his identity was exposed, that would be very bad. It
would affect the safety of the entire human race.</p>
<p>When Han Sen returned to the little jade island, Lone Bamboo was
there waiting for him. The man didn’t look to be in poor condition.
There was no sign in his countenance that he had just been released
from prison.</p>
<p>“I’m going to the Very High,” was the first thing Lone Bamboo
said. And that surprised Han Sen.</p>
<p>“Why the sudden change of heart?” Han Sen asked Lone Bamboo with
confusion. Lone Bamboo had been adamant about not going, and he had
claimed that he would rather remain in prison. Now he was free, and
he had changed his mind.</p>
<p>“I don’t want to go, but I can’t make you go in my stead. The
way the situation stands, I have to go,” Lone Bamboo said.</p>
<p>“Sky Palace Leader said he can figure this out. Perhaps there is
a way in which neither of us has to go,” Han Sen said.</p>
<p>Lone Bamboo shook his head. “There is no other way. We have to
send someone, and that person is either you, me, or another Sky
Palace student. So, I have decided that I will be the one to go to
the Very High.”</p>
<p>“Are you going to use Uncle Yu Shanxin’s Extreme Evil Path?” Han
Sen asked with curiosity. Lone Bamboo wasn’t an easy person to
sway. Han Sen was certain that Yu Shanxin would have offered his
protection from the beginning. If Lone Bamboo wanted to choose this
path, he could have from the beginning</p>
<p>Lone Bamboo shook his head again. “Using the Extreme Evil Path
can avoid the prying eyes of the Very High, but it gives the user
an evil mind. Evil will be watching you instead. You will still be
watched, so it makes no difference.”</p>
<p>Now Han Sen understood. Yu Shanxin deliberately left out the
most important part.</p>
<p>“Then what are you planning to do?” Han Sen asked quietly.</p>
<p>Lone Bamboo quietly looked out across the clouds, and he said,
“The Very High can feel everything I feel. So, all I must do is not
think or feel anything. I will only do what they want me to do.
Then, Exquisite will only see what I want her to see.”</p>
<p>“That will be a very difficult thing.” Han Sen knew how hard
that task would be.</p>
<p>There were many ways to control someone, but controlling
yourself was harder. The most dangerous enemy a person had was
always themselves.</p>
<p>So, Han Sen really admired Ning Yue. He had used a parasite
beast soul to watch Ning Yue once before, and Ning Yue spent years
practicing Buddhism. Han Sen was unable to glean any smidgen of
information from Ning Yue. Han Sen didn’t think he had that sort of
patience.</p>
<p>Lone Bamboo was planning the same. He was going to use his power
to control everything about his situation. He wasn’t going to allow
Exquisite to see all of his secrets.</p>
<p>Although Han Sen knew Lone Bamboo was doing this because he
didn’t want Han Sen to be his replacement, there was nothing much
he could say about it.</p>
<p>If he was alone, he would make the same decision as Lone Bamboo.
He wouldn’t mind fighting his inner demons.</p>
<p>But Han Sen had too much on the line. He was responsible for the
countless lives in the sanctuaries. If his mind’s fortitude failed,
Exquisite would learn everything. He wouldn’t only be hurting
himself then. So, Han Sen couldn’t afford to take that chance.</p>
<p>“Before I go, there is something I would like you to do,” Lone
Bamboo said softly. This was the reason he was there.</p>
<p>“What is it?” Han Sen asked.</p>
<p>“Help me take care of a child. Her name is Flower,” Lone Bamboo
said. “Is it a Sky Palace student? Is she related to you?” Han Sen
asked with curiosity.</p>
<p>Lone Bamboo shook his head. He thought for a moment, and then
answered, “Her and Purple-Eye Butterfly exist together. After I
combined with the genes of Purple-Eye Butterfly, she became a part
of me. She keeps wanting to kill me to avenge the death of
Purple-Eye Butterfly. It might be a little annoying. So, after I go
to the Very High, please take care of her.”</p>
<p>“That sounds a bit tricky, but don’t worry. If you want her to
live, I will take care of her.” Han Sen agreed to do this.</p>
<p>“That is great.” Lone Bamboo sighed. It was as if a weight had
been lifted from his shoulders.</p>
<p>To other people, it was hard to imagine why Lone Bamboo would
care so much about someone who wanted to kill him, but Han Sen
could understand. So, he didn’t ask anything more about it.
Instead, he just asked for more information concerning the girl
Flower.</p>
<p>When Lone Bamboo took his leave, Han Sen felt something clench
in his chest. He wished he could be like Lone Bamboo. He wouldn’t
mind going with the Very High, as it was just a battle of the mind.
Ning Yue could do it and Lone Bamboo dared to. Could Han Sen not do
it as well?</p>
<p>But then he thought about all the trouble he could bring down on
the sanctuaries. Han Sen smiled wryly and shook his head to clear
away the errant thoughts.</p>
<p>Han Sen thought that the matter had been resolved, but then
something happened that Han Sen and Lone Bamboo hadn’t
foreseen.</p>
<p>Exquisite now refused to take Lone Bamboo with her. She was only
interested in taking Han Sen, and no other would be considered.</p>
<p>That made Han Sen freeze. When he realized what was going on, he
wanted to slap himself in the face.</p>
<p>“I shouldn’t have gone to that meeting. Even if I went, why did
I have to test my talent for all of them to see? And even if I took
the test, why did I then go on to help the God Spirit Touch evolve?
That was just asking for trouble.” Han Sen cringed at his own
stupidity.</p>
<p>But no one had expected the Very High to be so willing to change
who they wanted. Han Sen should have been an outsider in these
matters, but somehow, he had become the crux of it all.</p>
<p>If Han Sen knew this would happen, he would have stayed home and
played games. He wouldn’t have attended the meeting.“I had it
coming.” Han Sen sighed.</p>
<p>“Han Sen! What do you think?” As Han Sen was going to visit Sky
Palace Leader, a smiling Yu Shanxin appeared next to him.</p>
<p>“I’m going to the Very High,” Han Sen said emotionlessly.</p>
<p>“Do you need me to use Extreme Evil Path?” Yu Shanxin asked with
a smile.</p>
<p>“Uncle Yu, you didn’t tell me that the demon would spy on me, as
well,” Han Sen said with a smile.</p>
<p>“Letting me see things is better than others seeing things. We
are a family. It’s fine, it’s fine…” Yu Shanxin said with a
smile.</p>
<p>Han Sen rolled his eyes and didn’t bother responding. He and Yu
Shanxin were on their way to the office. He had decided to go to
the Very High. If he didn’t, things would likely end poorly.</p>
<p>Plus, Han Sen had found a way to fight against the spying of the
Very High.</p>
