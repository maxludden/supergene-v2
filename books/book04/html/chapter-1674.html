	<p>Lou Jia waited until Han Yufei was gone, and they were at their most relieved. He reached his hand out to Ji
		Yanran, hoping to take Littleflower.</p>

	<p>Stay Up Late frowned and wanted to help, but just as he was going to strike, he stopped. There were two scary
		powers coming out of Ji Yanran.</p>

	<p>One of them was from the baby.</p>

	<p>Luo Jia’s hand was about to touch Littleflower when the baby’s body began to glow with white light. Lou Jia
		couldn’t touch Littleflower, even though he was only three inches away.</p>

	<p>Lou Jia’s eyes opened wide in disbelief. Although he had no geno armor, he had broken through the Fourth God’s
		Sanctuary and become a god. He hadn’t generated a geno armor yet, but his powers were stronger than any demigod,
		and he should have been stronger than a one-year-old child regardless.</p>

	<p>The power Littleflower released was as strong as his own, and he couldn’t believe it.</p>

	<p>“How can… a human child… have this kind of power? Did Han Jinzhi give that stuff to this kid…” Lou Jia was in
		shock. He wanted to take Littleflower even more.</p>

	<p>If Littleflower possessed what they wanted, he would be highly rewarded after taking the baby.</p>

	<p>Power exploded from Lou Jia’s body. He used force to reach further toward Littleflower, but there was a horrible
		power coming out of Ji Yanran, as well.</p>

	<p>There were crystal high heels on Ji Yanran’s feet. They looked like living things, and all of a sudden, they
		wrapped up Ji Yanran’s body in crystal armor.</p>

	<p>Ji Yanran was not good at fighting, but she was still a surpasses And if she had to fight, she could. She lifted
		her leg and started to kick the intruder. This did not require skill, and the crystal legs came firmly up to Lou
		Jia’s head.</p>

	<p>There was a pang sound, and before Lou Jia could react, his head was completely broken. Blood and brain matter
		were scattered all about.</p>

	<p>It was too powerful and it happened too fast. Lou Jia’s body stood there for a while before it crumpled and
		collapsed onto the ground.</p>

	<p>Zero and Lou Lan stood mutely, staring at Ji Yanran and her dead attacker. Then they stared at Ji Yanran’s
		crystal armor.</p>

	<p>Stay Up Late looked at them from afar, seeming very excited. He stared at Littleflower and Ji Yanran, in
		particular.</p>

	<p>“Human children can possess this power? They can evolve to that level? This is unbelievable.” Stay Up Late looked
		at Littleflower in shock.</p>

	<p>But when he looked at the crystal armor, he seemed to confirm something that confused him.</p>

	<p>“That should be impossible.” After looking at them some more, Stay Up Late glanced around. Then he disappeared.
		When he showed up again, he was at the back door of the cafe.</p>

	<p>“Interesting family. It looks like I was right.” Stay Up Late put on his apron, and a strange smile crossed his
		face.</p>

	<p>“Stay Up Late, why were you in the bathroom for so long? Customers are waiting.” The manager looked annoyed as he
		spoke.</p>

	<p>“I am sorry. I had an upset stomach. I will get to work now.” Stay Up Late walked over to the grinding machine.
		“Handsome dude, get me a cup of coffee! I want a freshly-ground one.”</p>

	<p>“Me, too…”</p>

	<p>“Can I have some love, please?”</p>

	<p>A group of rich, middle-aged women were standing outside. They enjoyed teasing Stay Up Late, who had just
		returned.</p>

	<p>“Just a moment, please.” Stay Up Late made the coffee with a smile.</p>

	<hr />

	<p>In Shadow Shelter, Han Sen was in a bad situation. The white donkey was right beside him, and he had to split his
		energy between dealing with Ancient Devil and the donkey too</p>

	<p>His Overbearing Shield had been destroyed, and only the Bulwark Umbrella was available for his protection. It put
		him in a tough spot.</p>

	<p>Split-Blade was held firmly in Han Sen’s hand, but it wasn’t as useful as Overbearing Shield. He was getting
		attacked by a whole group, and he couldn’t fight back much.</p>

	<p>Katcha!</p>

	<p>After he got hit twice, the surface of the umbrella cracked. Han Sen’s heartfelt heavy.</p>

	<p>“It looks like I’ll have to use Destiny’s Tower.” Han Sen had resigned himself to it. The fact was, if he didn’t
		win the fight right now, there would be no afterwards. Exposing his identity did not matter too much if the
		alternative was death.</p>

	<p>But before he used the Blood Legion technique, he felt his Dongxuan Sutra undergo a change.</p>

	<p>His Dongxuan Sutra had one last tier he had thus far been unable to break into. That was why Bulwark Umbrella had
		been unable to level up.</p>

	<p>Han Sen had four geno cores. The Crystal Core connected to the new Jadeskin. There were no more additional levels
		that it could achieve.</p>

	<p>Real Blood connected to the Blood-Pulse Sutra. There was one more skill he could still learn, and it should be
		the skill to level up to the Fifth Sanctuary.</p>

	<p>Dollar connected to his super king spirit body. Han Sen did not have to practice that any longer; when super king
		spirit got stronger, Dollar geno core would follow.</p>

	<p>Bulwark Umbrella connected to the Dongxuan Sutra. There was still one more tier for it to ascend. Aside from the
		part which was linked to leveling up to the Fifth Sanctuary, there was another part created by Dongxuan Zi, the
		man who could break through the vacuum.</p>

	<p>That part was the Dongxuan Sutra’s ability to leave the Alliance. Han Sen took it seriously, and he practiced
		that the most.</p>

	<p>When Dongxuan Zi broke through the vacuum, he accidentally entered the First God’s Sanctuary. The place he had
		wanted to go was the Hero’s Spirit Hall, where those powerful creatures had died. But he ended up going to the
		First God’s Sanctuary instead. Something must have gone wrong.</p>

	<p>That explained why Dongxuan Zi was injured and died. Dongxuan Zi was much stronger than Han Sen, and after he
		broke through the vacuum, he was alive in the First God’s Sanctuary. And he spent time writing the Dongxuan
		Sutra. It was odd that he had just died like that.</p>

	<p>Han Sen only had one explanation for this.</p>

	<p>Dongxuan Zi’s power was stronger than the strength of the five sanctuaries, and that included the Alliance. That
		was why he went to the First God’s Sanctuary. It was the sanctuary above where the gods lived.</p>

	<p>According to the rules of the sanctuary, creatures in a higher tier would ruin their body if they went one
		sanctuary lower. That was why Dongxuan Zi died. He couldn’t recover.</p>

	<p>Han Sen wanted to practice the Dongxuan Sutra, but the Dongxuan Sutra was the slowest of all skills.</p>

	<p>Especially the last step in the fourth tier. He had practiced for so long and had not had a breakthrough. Now the
		umbrella was damaged and the Dongxuan Sutra was exhibiting changes; Han Sen was so happy.</p>
