    <p>
      God&#8217;s Third Hand was a very famous player in the Hand of God
      community circles.
    </p>

    <p>
      Over the past five years, God&#8217;s Third Hand had managed to beat out
      every other professional evolver Hand of God player, coming first place in
      four of the annual Hand of God championships in the process. His talent
      for the game resulted in others referring to him as &#8220;God&#8217;s
      favorite child.&#8221;
    </p>

    <p>
      In addition to his constant practice of the game, his legendary status was
      achieved in a variety of different ways. And aside from being naturally
      talented, he had a special hyper geno art that aided his play.
    </p>

    <p>
      Everyone knew his name in the Hand of God circles, but even he had yet to
      beat super mode. His speed and reactions could not match that of the AI,
      and it had been believed that evolvers were unable to beat the
      master-level AI.
    </p>

    <p>
      But now, all of a sudden, an unknown evolver had managed to beat super
      mode. It was difficult for people to believe, and he did not believe it,
      either.
    </p>

    <p>
      He assumed whoever had won had managed to forge their identity, and thus
      it was most likely a surpasser acting under the guise of an evolver. That
      was how the cheater had managed to do it, he believed.
    </p>

    <p>
      God&#8217;s Third Hand wasted no time in inviting Han Sen to match, and he
      was keen to prove whether or not his theory was correct.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen had spent much time battling the AI to beat the hardest
      difficulty. To keep going was pointless, but now that a real person had
      invited him to play, his interest was reinvigorated. Thinking it might be
      fun, he accepted the invite without hesitation.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Win A Girlfriend and God&#8217;s Third Hand now compete.&#8221; The
      system announced, as a special treatment for those who had achieved the
      title Hand of God.
    </p>

    <p>
      Hearing this news, everyone was shocked. They all quickly scrambled to
      spectate the match.
    </p>

    <p>
      God&#8217;s Third Hand was very famous, and widely recognized as a
      legendary professional with the game. Han Sen, who was unknown and had
      just achieved the title Hand of God, was going to compete with him.
      Intense matches such as this were rare, and only those widely invested in
      the game could truly grasp how monumental an event such as this really
      was.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen did not know his one randomly accepted friend request would result
      in this, and he at first thought God&#8217;s Third Hand was just another
      average, run-of-the-mill player.
    </p>

    <p>
      To be the very first person to send a request, you&#8217;d need to be
      lightning-quick. So perhaps it made sense that God&#8217;s Third Hand had
      gotten in first.
    </p>

    <p>
      But even if Han Sen knew beforehand how strong he was, he wouldn&#8217;t
      have cared too much.
    </p>

    <p>
      The match started, and every eye in the audience turned to view their
      hands. With bated breath, they tensely anticipated the appearance of the
      first light to show.
    </p>

    <p>
      Whoever hit a hundred lightspots first would be deemed the victor. You
      could either grab the lights near you, or the ones belonging to your
      opponent. Each lightspot was worth one point, and one hundred was needed
      to win.
    </p>

    <p>
      God&#8217;s Third Hand watched Han Sen&#8217;s hands intently, eagerly
      waiting to witness his speed. If he was too fast, then God&#8217;s Third
      Hand would know he was just a cheap cheater.
    </p>

    <p>
      Many people thought the same way as God&#8217;s Third Hand, too. After
      all, he had been playing for many years, and not a single evolver had yet
      to reach fifty-percent completion of super mode. And that included
      God&#8217;s Third Hand.
    </p>

    <p>
      Somehow, this previously unknown &#8220;Win A Girlfriend&#8221; entered
      the scene and finished what was believed to be impossible. Few people put
      stock in the validity of the win.
    </p>

    <p>
      The first lightspot appeared, and everyone looked at Han Sen&#8217;s hand.
      Much to the surprise of everyone, the hand moved relatively slowly. The
      speed was remarkably average, when compared to most high-level players. He
      couldn&#8217;t compete well in traditional matchmade games if he genuinely
      played like that.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Did he really beat super mode with such speed?&#8221; Everyone
      thought to themselves.
    </p>

    <p>
      God&#8217;s Third Hand frowned, also thinking Han Sen&#8217;s move was
      slow. But just as he went to reach his own lightspot, he noticed Han Sen
      had already taken it.
    </p>

    <p>1 : 0</p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Whoa!&#8221; Seeing this, many people made a variety of different
      noises indicating surprise.
    </p>

    <p>
      God&#8217;s Third Hand was faster, so how could Win A Girlfriend grab the
      lightspot first? That confused many people.
    </p>

    <p>
      Win A Girlfriend now moved to God&#8217;s Third Hand&#8217;s side, looking
      as if he was about to steal his next lightspot.
    </p>

    <p>
      God&#8217;s Third Hand&#8217;s face looked cold, and he did not believe
      his opponent&#8217;s speed would be enough to beat him.
    </p>

    <p>
      But this was exactly what he wanted. To fight him face to face would
      expose his speed and reveal to everyone how much of a cheater his rival
      was.
    </p>

    <p>
      Over the next minute, however, God&#8217;s Third Hand felt as if he had
      slipped into a sordid nightmare.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen&#8217;s hands were not fast, and they were most certainly slower
      than his own, but God&#8217;s Third Hand had not managed to grab a single
      lightspot. It was so strange, it genuinely made him feel as if he was
      having a bad dream.
    </p>

    <p>
      No matter how hard he tried, no matter how much effort he put into
      increasing his own speed, he couldn&#8217;t hit a single lightspot. The
      audience was entirely quiet, as well, unable to believe what they were
      seeing.
    </p>

    <p>A legendary professional player did not have a single point.</p>

    <p>
      It would have made sense if Han Sen&#8217;s hands were fast, but they
      weren&#8217;t. In fact, he looked very relaxed.
    </p>

    <p>
      But God&#8217;s Third Hand&#8217;s lightspots were all snatched by the
      flimsy, casual hands. It made people feel pretty awkward on God&#8217;s
      Third Hand&#8217;s behalf. And nobody could really understand what was
      going on.
    </p>

    <p>
      The true elites of Hand of God were even more shocked than the rest of the
      audience.
    </p>

    <p>
      They believed God&#8217;s Third Hand&#8217;s movements were seen by Han
      Sen beforehand. It was like Han Sen treated God&#8217;s Third Hand like a
      puppet on a string.
    </p>

    <p>&#8220;This cannot be real!&#8221; Everyone started to think.</p>

    <p>
      At the same time, they realized how scary this thought genuinely was. The
      man was a legendary, professional player who had won numerous contests.
      Yet now, he was getting wrecked by a person they hadn&#8217;t seen before.
      Truly, this new contender was frighteningly strong.
    </p>

    <p>
      No one believed Han Sen was cheating now, either. Even if he was playing
      against the AI, cheating would only enable him to react faster. He
      couldn&#8217;t actively work to block an opponent from grabbing a
      lightspot.
    </p>

    <p>
      AI could not predict the decisions of a human, but even if you did not
      directly compete with the AI, you could still manage to grab lightspots
      for yourself.
    </p>

    <p>
      For that slow speed to prohibit every approach by God&#8217;s Third Hand
      was something not even the AI was able to do.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;It&#8217;s like he can control fate itself. This person is the real
      Hand of God,&#8221; the audience thought to themselves.
