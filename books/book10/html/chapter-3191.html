<p>Before the space tunnel closed for their departure, Rocky Dee turned around and asked Han Sen, “Do you not think breaking the world is awesome? There is strength in between breaking the world, and you just broke the world. Not many elites can kill you, but there are still one or two that might. If I were you, I would let Master Bao’er go with me.”</p>

<p>“I am not going to hand my daughter over to anybody,” Han Sen calmly said. “I will not let anyone hurt her.”</p>

<p>Rocky Dee grunted coldly. He did not turn his head as he left through the space tunnel.</p>

<p>Seeing the space tunnel shut down, Han Sen said to himself, “If this really is how I think it is, then this will all be a great deal of trouble.”</p>

<p>Han Sen entered the top four rounds of fights, and Bao’er joined in too. Their luck wasn’t too shabby either. They were not pitted against each other. They had to fight the others who were also in the top four.</p>

<p>Han Sen was quite surprised by the turnout. In their semi-final matches, neither Han Sen’s nor Bao’er’s opponent showed up. They had given up and quit.</p>

<p>It was the most boring set of semi-finals ever witnessed, and the same was going to hold true for the finale. The semi-finals did not happen, and the finals weren’t going to depict a grand bout either. Bao’er immediately quit, which enabled Han Sen to achieve the No. 1 rank in the god fights.</p>

<p>The other two people were very famous in the geno universe. As for them conceding, people did not say much about it.</p>

<p>Everyone knew that fighting Han Sen was likely futile, so everyone thought they too would quit if they were in their shoes. The same was true for going up against Bao’er. After all, they had even managed to make the God Spirits break the rules. It would have been weird for them to actually consider fighting the pair. No one wanted to risk their lives in a battle with such an unfair environment.</p>

<p>If they entered the space battleground, they might not have been able to make it out alive even if they conceded. If they did not concede, they could not use God Spirit gene races. If they used them, they would be punished by the God Spirits they had pledged their loyalty to. If they did not use them and could not fight Dollar and Ingot, it would have been a fight in which they were practically throwing themselves into the furnace. It was a death wish. Even stupid people knew the best course of action.</p>

<p>Han Sen was the most dishonorable winner in the history of the god fights, but no one questioned his claim to be a victor and the might that secured him the No. 1 position.</p>

<p>Although he had won without fighting, Han Sen felt good about it. He did not have time to waste concerning himself about whether or not it was right to win the god fights without battling. All he cared about were the results.</p>

<p>When Han Sen earned first place in the god fights, a light fired into the space battleground. It landed on Han Sen, making his body disappear.</p>

<p>Han Sen did not fight back. It was a teleportation light. It did not harm him.</p>

<p>Han Sen’s vision constantly flashed. When he was able to see again, he realized he was inside a giant god hall.</p>

<p>The god halls were the most obvious things to recognize. There was a light in the center that was very old and mysterious. The light had small lights. There had to have at least been 10,000 of them.</p>

<p>Han Sen was no stranger to these lanterns. The 10,000 lanterns were race lanterns. Every race lantern had the race’s name on it. The first was still the Very High.</p>

<p>Han Sen carefully looked at the race lanterns. He did not, strangely enough, see a human race lantern. Obviously, the humans had yet to light up their lanterns.</p>

<p>The elusive God was sitting on the god throne of the god hall. Han Sen was very familiar with that bloke. Now, he should have called him God Hall Master, the strongest Reboot God Spirit in the universe.</p>

<p>“It is impossible for humans to light up a lantern for themselves,” God Hall Leader coldly said. “I have already told you that humans should not exist in the geno universe.”</p>

<p>“Their existence makes sense,” Han Sen said with a laugh. “If humans already exist in the geno universe, why can we not light up a lantern?”</p>

<p>“The fact you can’t means you can’t,” God Hall Leader said. “There is no why. You just can’t. If humans really did light up a lantern in the geno universe, let’s not mention the others for a moment, but even God Spirits like me would not ignore such an event. Letting the crystallizers light a lantern is the best we can do.”</p>

<p>“Fine. I don’t really care about humans lighting up lanterns, anyway. The reward for coming first in the god fights should be mine now, shouldn’t it?” Han Sen smiled at God Hall Leader as he spoke.</p>

<p>“Fine.” God Hall Leader did not mention anything about Han Sen breaking the rules again. He agreed with him rather quickly. He lobbed the gene egg at Han Sen. It landed in his hands.</p>

<p>God Hall Leader smiled at Han Sen. He looked at him as he said, “That is a rare gene egg. It is a xuan holy turtle. Are you satisfied now?”</p>

<p>“I thought you said the No. 1 would be able to pick which rare gene egg he wanted? Can I not be given a turtle?” Han Sen looked at the pitch-black thing. It looked very average.</p>

<p>“OK.” God Hall Leader clapped his hands. A wheel of fortune appeared in front of Han Sen.</p>

<p>Han Sen looked at the wheel of fortune as he asked, “How are the slices all so empty? How am I supposed to know what I am going to get?”</p>

<p>God Hall Leader laughed. “You just spin it. No matter which slice you get, I will write down xuan holy turtle.”</p>

<p>“If you do that, then why did you need a wheel of fortune for it?” Han Sen looked at God Hall Leader with an icy expression.</p>

<p>“What is important is that it can make you feel like you are in control. It can satisfy and provide your heart with a bit of a thrill.” God Hall Leader pointed at the wheel and said, “Hurry up and spin the thing.”</p>

<p>“What is the point of spinning? Do you think I am that free?” Han Sen’s eyes twitched as he spoke.</p>

<p>“OK. That will save you some time.” God Hall Leader admired Han Sen’s ability to understand so much. He clapped his hands. The big wheel of fortune disappeared.</p>

<p>“Usually, you do not need to come here to claim your reward,” God Hall Leader said as he smiled at Han Sen. “Today, I asked you to come because there is something that I would like to bend your ear for.”</p>

<p>“I’m busy. I still have my kids to feed. Why don’t we talk about this another time?” He did not believe God Hall Leader was so willing to just invite him in for telling stories.</p>

<p>“That is fine by me,” God Hall Leader said, acting as if he did not care. “I suppose the extinction of humanity is no big deal.”</p>

<p>“What is going on?” Han Sen had to concede.</p>

<p>God Hall Leader asked, “You have been to Outer Sky where the Very High roam, correct? You know what that place is like.”</p>

<p>“I have heard it resides in a zone between the real world and the anti-material world,” Han Sen said. “I never did find out if there was any validity to the claims.”</p>

<p>God Hall Leader nodded. “Yes. Outer Sky really is a buffer zone that resides between the real world and the anti-material world. There should not be any glitches in a buffer zone like that, such as the lake that resides in Outer Sky. It is an outright crack between the real world and anti-material worlds. That is why people can fish up some stuff from that anti-material lake.”</p>

<p>Han Sen had already been able to guess that much. He had always been curious to learn about why a glitch like that existed.</p>

<p>God Hall Leader seemed to see what Han Sen was thinking. He sighed and said, “This has something to do with God Chaos Party and the war against the God Spirits. To put it simply, after a big fight and a reboot, the universe did not totally recover. There are many glitches in it now. That is why people like you and Qin Xiu are allowed to exist. You reincarnate between the real world and the anti-material world. That is why there are spirits like Moon God and Zhou Dong Lai. They carry memories over from a past life.”</p>

<p>“You are not going to make me fix those glitches, are you?” Han Sen quickly asked. “I don’t have the power to do that.”</p>

<p>God Hall Leader rolled his eyes. “I know you don’t have that power. The God Chaos Party is in a buffer zone. They are trying to open a path through the real world and the anti-material world. Although they have not yet succeeded in doing so, it would be best if their antics were put to an end. Therefore…”</p>

<p>After saying that, God Hall Leader smiled and looked at Han Sen.</p>
