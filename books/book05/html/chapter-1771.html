<h2>The Swordmind Is Bursting</h2>
<h3>Chapter 1771</h3>

<p>The wall itself cracked when Hai’er slammed into it. The Pirate
Bone Sword in Hai’er’s hands was knocked out of her grip.</p>
<p>Mister Elephant threw another punch towards Hai’er. But the
girl’s eyes were very round, and she said quietly, “Elephant… you
really dare hurt me?”</p>
<p>Mister Elephant’s punch was like that of an elephant’s trunk,
and a scary power traveled with it. But when the fist came right
before Hai’er, he stopped.</p>
<p>The Zhenyue were strong, and people considered them a higher
race. But he had to hold himself in check.</p>
<p>Abandoned Thief had made them a promise, but there were limits
to the protection that promise offered. If Mister Elephant took the
item from Hai’er, and the Pirates couldn’t say anything.</p>
<p>If he hurt Hai’er, they wouldn’t let things slide so easily.</p>
<p>Abandoned Thief had gone on thieving sprees a lot, back in the
day. The higher races of the geno hall were frightened due to the
frequent robbing. Although Abandoned Thief was long gone, the
Pirates continued his legacy.</p>
<p>Mister Elephant did not know if his actions could be avenged,
but he’d rather not find out. After all, thieves never failed to
keep their promises. Everyone in the universe knew the reputation
of the Pirates.</p>
<p>If Hai’er was important to them, it would risk the entirety of
Zhenyue being ruined. He didn’t want to find out what might happen
if he injured or killed her.</p>
<p>“No…” Mister Elephant’s face was still directly in front of
Hai’er. He started to say something further, but his face suddenly
changed. He roared, lifted his arms again, and spun around.</p>
<p>A horn arrow was racing towards his throat.</p>
<p>Mister Elephant threw his fist towards it, but the horn arrow
suddenly disappeared. When it appeared again, the arrow was
directly in front of his chest. The spinning arrow was going to
pierce through his armor and drill through his flesh.</p>
<p>Roar! Mister Elephant moved his body, and in that moment, he
teleported one foot away. He dodged the evil arrow.</p>
<p>The next second, Mister Elephant’s look of victory was replaced
by fear. Another, more silent arrow, was touching his belly. The
spinning arrow tip managed to pierce through his armor.</p>
<p>Mister Elephant moved his body and tightened his muscles. He
released a burst of power, but it was too late. He couldn’t dodge
the silent arrow.</p>
<p>The horn arrow wasn’t sharp enough to pierce all the way into
his belly. It could, however, break his bones. The powerful
drilling force shredded muscle and bone. After inserting itself
half an inch into his stomach, it stopped swirling.</p>
<p>It was too late to pull it out, though. By the time he had dealt
with those two arrows, Hai’er was attacking from behind. And
although she had dropped the Pirate Bone Sword, she still had a
white-fanged dagger, and she swung it at Mister Elephant’s
back.</p>
<p>Mister Elephant grabbed Hai’er, then tossed her aside.</p>
<p>He still didn’t want to hurt her.</p>
<p>In the corner of his eye, though, he managed to catch a glimpse
of his other attacker.</p>
<p>When he saw the person clearly, Mister Elephant was shocked.
When he saw the arrow at first, twenty names and faces crossed his
mind. The face of his true aggressor, however, hadn’t been on the
list.</p>
<p>The person that fired at him was the creature Hai’er had used as
bait. He was wearing black armor, and although Mister Elephant
couldn’t see his face, he remembered the armor.</p>
<p>Mister Elephant always remembered what he saw, and this was not
a mistake.</p>
<p>He didn’t expect that Hai’er’s bait would still be alive at this
point. And on top of that, the lesser being had come to Old Dragon
Rock Mountain and attacked Mister Elephant twice.</p>
<p>Mister Elephant knew that anyone capable of using those arrows
was not weak. And yet despite that, he knew that this being was
merely a Baron.</p>
<p>It was shocking that a Baron was able to hurt him. If the arrow
had been any stronger, he’d have been killed.</p>
<p>When Mister Elephant threw Hai’er away, Han Sen stepped over to
the wall and picked up the Pirate Bone Sword.</p>
<p>Han Sen had encountered several Viscounts, but Mister Elephant
was far stronger than Nicai and Hawei. He was a greater foe in
every aspect, from strength, to speed, to techniques.</p>
<p>Hai’er was hit hard, and she was still unable to get up.</p>
<p>Mister Elephant was no longer paying attention to her, though.
She was a Pirate, and she was very evil. But she was too weak to
pose a true threat to him.</p>
<p>For some reason, Mister Elephant was starting to feel nervous
with Han Sen there. Han Sen and Hai’er were both Barons, but Han
Sen seemed to be the more frightening of the two. Which was
particularly notable considering that Hai’er was one of the
Pirates.</p>
<p>Mister Elephant stared at Han Sen and said coldly, “I didn’t
expect you to be a son of the Pirates.”</p>
<p>Mister Elephant thought Han Sen was a Pirate, too. Otherwise,
how else could he have achieved such power? His power was not the
sort of power one could expect any Baron to possess.</p>
<p>Even among Barons of the higher races, it was incredibly rare to
see someone of that level.</p>
<p>Han Sen didn’t say anything, though. He was here to kill, and
that was that. He had no interest in talking. And it wouldn’t be a
bad thing if people thought he was a Pirate, either.</p>
<p>If the Zhenyue went after him, he’d be safer that way</p>
<p>Han Sen lifted the sword and ran towards Mister Elephant. He ran
lightly, moving with grace.</p>
<p>Mister Elephant grunted, and he used the powers of an elephant
to tighten and harden his muscles. He could burst with energy like
that for a while. Mister Elephant did not think he would lose, even
to someone of a higher race. Since he was a Viscount, there was no
way he’d lose to a Baron.</p>
<p>But when Han Sen struck, Mister Elephant regretted his
overconfidence.</p>
<p>He had heard that an elite swordsman could gather their
swordmind. They could cast blasts of air without the faintest
movement of their sword.</p>
<p>Mister Elephant had seen this before, but only from Dukes that
were talented with sword skills and possessed powerful sword
minds.</p>
<p>And again, this was just a Baron. But when Han Sen struck,
Mister Elephant felt as if his whole world had been taken by that
sword. The scary swordmind became tangible, and he almost couldn’t
breathe.</p>
<p>Mister Elephant did not believe such a swordmind could be
created by a Baron.</p>
<p>He used to know one swordsman that had become a Duke, but not
even his swordmind was as good as this Baron’s.</p>
