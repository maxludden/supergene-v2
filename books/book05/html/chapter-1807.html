<h3>Chapter 1807</h3>

<p>The light was so small and so fast, and it came at the speed of
light. Han Sen couldn’t dodge it, and when the light pelted them,
they all felt numbed. They were not injured though.</p>
<p>Their armor could not resist the shock of the light, either. Han
Sen tried to use a few of his powers, but none of them worked. They
continued moving ahead, and more of those lights appeared. The
lights struck their bodies again and made them even more numb. They
could barely walk with the constant zaps.</p>
<p>“Mister Vic, if this keeps going, we’ll be paralyzed here. We
will be stuck here, and we will eventually die. You are our
commander, so you should be the one who thinks of something!” Rocks
Fall Duke sounded mocking.</p>
<p>Vic frowned. He hadn’t expected anything like this to happen. He
thought there would be easily-identifiable dangers ahead, and that
was why he had allowed Han Sen and Rocks Fall Duke to go on
ahead.</p>
<p>But instead, no enemies had revealed themselves. And this was
something they all had to endure together. So, the plan he had made
was useless.</p>
<p>“The lights don’t seem to hurt anyone; they just make us numb.
If you don’t want to walk any further, then just go on back,” Vic
said coldly.</p>
<p>Rocks Fall Duke mockingly said, “That’s your idea, huh? Wow. You
are really experienced, you’re so right! Ordinary leaders couldn’t
come up with such a grand plan.”</p>
<p>“What idea do you have, then? How about you tell me?” Vic had a
cold face.</p>
<p>“I’m not the commander. I don’t have any ideas,” Rocks Fall Duke
sneered.</p>
<p>They were arguing, but none of them stopped walking.</p>
<p>Han Sen continued walking forward, but with a frown. The tunnel
was circular, and it was as if they were traveling down a pipeline.
But the whole time, more and more of that lightning came raining
down on them. It was as if they were in a time machine.</p>
<p>The light didn’t hurt anyone, but the more light there was, the
more numb they became. Han Sen was worried about his body losing
all sensation. And if that happened, he might not be able to keep
walking and he would die.</p>
<p>Han Sen felt like the proverbial frog in a pan of water. The
heat was slowly being turned up, and the group had no idea that
they were about to die.</p>
<p>“I can’t do it. My body is so numb. I can’t walk any further. If
I keep walking, I’ll die here,” Hawk Wing said, swinging his legs,
step after step.</p>
<p>Vic felt as if he could not hold on any longer either. “Let’s
fall back and see if there is a different route.”</p>
<p>Rocks Fall Duke gave no response because he himself felt as if
he could no longer hold on. He wasn’t in the mood to mock his
companion, so he agreed that they should walk back.</p>
<p>Not long after, as Han Sen continued to walk, his face changed.
On their return, the lightning did not reduce. It was still gaining
power.</p>
<p>“We have been tricked by the people who designed this! They knew
that we’d think that we could decrease the lightning by turning
around. But the lightning grows stronger no matter which way you
travel.” Rocks Fall Duke looked terrible.</p>
<p>Mister Vic did not say a word. He suddenly stood up straight,
though, and then ran deeper inside the cave.</p>
<p>Now Han Sen understood what Vic had been thinking. It was death
going back the way they came. Now that the lightning had increased,
they’d have to find an exit soon or be rendered unable to move.
Now, they could only go forward, and if they made it past this one
spot, they’d be able to live.</p>
<p>The chance was slim, but that was the only faint hope they could
cling to. After Hawk Wing and Rocks Fall Duke noticed this, they
too ran forward.</p>
<p>Han Sen wished to run, but Yisha pulled him. He looked at
her.</p>
<p>“Running is useless. This passageway is not that simple,” Yisha
said quietly.</p>
<p>“What is this place?” Han Sen asked Yisha.</p>
<p>Yisha laughed and said. “About our co-operation, what do you
think?”</p>
<p>“I said I am willing to co-operate, but you need to tell me
what’s going on,” Han Sen said.</p>
<p>“If we are co-operating, I will tell you things clearly. I can
get you out of this place alive. But if we are co-operating, you
also need to pay me, right?” Yisha smiled.</p>
<p>“What do you want me to pay?” Han Sen asked.</p>
<p>Yisha looked at Han Sen and asked, “The power you used against
me on the lake, how long does it last?”</p>
<p>Yisha did not believe the power Han Sen used would have cost him
nothing.</p>
<p>But the fact of the matter was, Han Sen did not have to pay to
use that power. The only cost of using super god spirit was a vast
amount of energy, and he did not last long with it</p>
<p>“Can I not answer that?” Han Sen said calmly. He was weak now,
and if he used it, it wouldn’t last a second.</p>
<p>“Okay. But there’s a dangerous area near the end of this place.
We’ll need your power to get through it,” Yisha explained. “If we
co-operate, I will bring you to a safe place. You just have to help
me with this. Can you do that?”</p>
<p>“Okay, but you have to tell me what is going on.” Han Sen
nodded.</p>
<p>Yisha went quiet and said, “This is not some monster’s cave. It
is a creature device that was created by the crystallizers.” “Built
by the crystallizers? What is it?” Han Sen asked hastily.</p>
<p>Yisha pointed at the lights and said, “These devices are simple
to use. They make ordinary creatures xenogeneic. They create them.
The lights are testing apparatus to make sure that we have what it
takes to qualify and become xenogeneic. When the light reaches a
certain amount of strength, it will level out. With our strength,
you and I can get through this.”</p>
<p>“Why did the crystallizers create xenogeneics?” Han Sen
asked.</p>
<p>“To be stronger. The crystallizers weren’t strong, but they were
hi-tech. They were most certainly the best in the universe.” Yisha
kept on walking, and went on to say, “The Chaos were the guinea
pigs of the crystallizers. The two elites were fighting for
ownership of this xenogeneic creation machine. They were both
injured eventually, and the sheer power they unleashed broke the
dimensional rules here. The xenogeneic machine was left in space,
missing. No one could get it.”</p>
<p>“Oh. I thought they were fighting for the scabbard and the
knife.” Han Sen patted his waist, wanting to learn anything he
could about that.</p>
<p>Yisha coldly said, “The scabbard is a crystallizer item, but it
is a failure. It did not belong to Demon Grave originally, and
someone must have brought it here.”</p>
