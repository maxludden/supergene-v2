<p>Teleporting so fast through broken space made the scary power
from behind become weaker. When Han Sen exited the broken space
area. He did not see that Annihilation God Spirit follow. Bai King
must have halted its pursuit.</p>
<p>“The spirit weapon the Extreme King made was stronger than the
Holy Kirin. That is surprising.” Han Sen was shocked.</p>
<p>Thinking of how that thing came from the Extreme King alpha, it
must have been handed down generation after generation. It was
unknown how many xenogeneic spirits had been built into it. It was
not impossible for it to possess such wild strength.</p>
<p>It was enough to fight an Annihilation class God Spirit. Han Sen
still thought it was too ridiculous.</p>
<p>“Why does Bai King treat me the way he does?” Han Sen thought.
That was what he wondered about the most.</p>
<p>In the past, Bai King was in a rush to save him in the god
temple. He was so surprised. Now, Bai King was willing to fight an
Annihilation class God Spirit to save him. That made no sense.</p>
<p>“No matter what, let me get out of here first.” Han Sen was
silent. He did not dare return to Space Garden yet. He teleported
to the outskirts of the big barren systems.</p>
<p>He was afraid the God Spirit would trace his retreat into Space
Garden. If it followed him there, he feared things would not go so
well.</p>
<p>Going to the outskirts, Han Sen went into the big barren systems
again. He wanted to use the hidden power inside the big barren
systems so that the God Spirit would not find out where he was. He
would then be able to escape with Han Sen’s identity.</p>
<p>Han Sen had only just entered the big barren systems when he
heard some thunder rage above his head. The space around cracked.
It resulted in it all cracking like a spiderweb. That God Spirit
tore through space and managed to catch up.</p>
<p>“I thought that after a God Spirit was possessed, their powers
were restricted by their bodies. I thought they could only be true
god class at best. This God Spirit’s power is way better than a
true god class.” Han Sen frowned.</p>
<p>Han Sen looked at the God Spirit and asked, “Where is Bai
King?”</p>
<p>“I, Kill Sky God, want to kill. Not even God can stop me, and he
is just a creature in the universe.” Kill Sky God was holding his
god hammer. He was floating in space and coldly looking at Han Sen
as he spoke.</p>
<p>Han Sen heard Kill Sky God’s tone of voice and felt a flush of
relief. It seemed as if Bai King had not been killed by him.</p>
<p>Kill Sky God raised the hammer in his hand. In a voice laden
with disdain, he said, “The slayers of gods should be killed. No
one can save you now.”</p>
<p>Kill Sky God used one hand to hold the giant hammer and swung it
down. It was like the whole of space had become some brittle glass
Beneath the hammer. It just broke with the strike of the
hammer.</p>
<p>Han Sen’s eyes froze. His body was suddenly full of light. He
entered Super God Spirit mode again. The shattering space had not
left any marks on him.</p>
<p>The Sky Vine Radish God Lance brought some cold light forward.
It was thrust toward Kill Sky God. With a look of disdain, Kill Sky
God raised his hammer to attack the Sky Vine Radish God Lance. Han
Sen flashed away holding the lance. He went behind Kill Sky God and
thrust it through the back of his head.</p>
<p>“Super Spank!” Han Sen was still in Super God Spirit mode. He
used Super Spank’s power at max capacity.</p>
<p>Katcha-cha!</p>
<p>The tip of the lance broke behind Kill Sky God. It sounded like
metal shattering. It was like some metal had been sucked into a
blender.</p>
<p>God light and sparks were everywhere. The tip of the Sky Vine
Radish God Lance only went in about five inches before not being
able to proceed further. Super Spank’s power was not enough to
completely destroy Kill Sky God’s substance chain. It only
shattered a few of the substance chains that were outside.</p>
<p>Kill Sky God waved his big hammer as Han Sen had to pull his
lance back. He used Galaxy Teleportation to get away from that
system.</p>
<p>Under the Super God Spirit mode, the broken space layers were
unable to prevent him from using Galaxy Teleportation, but Wan’er
was still inside his Destiny’s Tower. She was burning with gold
light. She canceled Han Sen’s Super God Spirit mode.</p>
<p>Han Sen gnashed his teeth and held on, but he could not keep it
up. His body fell out of Super God Spirit mode, forcing him out of
Galaxy Teleportation.</p>
<p>Although he left Kill Sky God’s broken space, he was still
inside the big barren systems. He had not gone too far.</p>
<p>Without Super God Spirit mode, Galaxy Teleportation could not be
used in the big barren systems because they had magnetic storms and
space vortexes.</p>
<p>Han Sen tried his best to get to the holy palace. There, the
darkness power would at least affect the God Spirit. The God Spirit
would not dare venture near that place. He had the Holy Kirin
spirit, which restricted the darkness from damaging him while he
was in there. That was the best place for Han Sen to use as a
battleground.</p>
<p>Han Sen had not been flying for long when the sound of Kill Sky
God’s big hammer broke space again. The spiderweb-like cracks in
space reappeared and covered the sky to trap Han Sen.</p>
<p>“Wan’er! Wan’er! It is not that I do not want to take care of
you. It is just because this is a critical moment. I need to live
for the future.” Han Sen raised his hand and Destiny’s Tower
appeared in it. Han Sen tossed it out.</p>
<p>Seeing the Destiny’s Tower go further and further, Han Sen felt
Super God Spirit body could be used with his body again. Wan’er’s
effects on him were diminishing.</p>
<p>“Destiny’s Tower? Impossible. You are not a God Spirit! How can
you have Destiny’s Tower?” Kill Sky God saw Han Sen throw Destiny’s
Tower away. He was shocked.</p>
<p>Seeing it twice, Kill Sky God saw something amiss. He looked at
Destiny’s Tower and said, “No, this is not Destiny’s Tower. It is
just a copy of Destiny’s Tower. I think I have seen this copy
someplace else. I know it now. Back then, Sacred Leader wanted to
create Destiny’s Tower. It did not break. It is still here. They
should really die.”</p>
<p>Kill Sky God’s face looked more murderous. He kept clutching his
giant hammer, but he did not attack. A scary power was gathering up
in the big hammer. There were very old and mysterious spells on
each side of the hammer.</p>
<p>Han Sen’s body still had Super God Spirit mode, but he was still
worried. From inside Destiny’s Tower, something was thrown away.
Wan’er’s body shone with a golden light. It looked crazy as she
entered blonde mode. It was just like Han Sen. She adopted a
strange status. Her body kept rapidly increasing.</p>
<p>It was still different from Han Sen. His Super God Spirit mode
was not able to harm him. He just had to get out before it
ended.</p>
<p>Wan’er was different. Her blonde mode cost her significant life
every second. If she was blonde for too long, there was a chance
her life force would end with it.</p>
<p>The scariest thing was that after she turned into blonde mode,
she would not recognize anyone. She would become like the raging
demon lady. There was a chance that she would emerge from Destiny’s
Tower not knowing who was a friend and who was a foe.</p>
<p>“Whatever you are, just go to hell!” The symbols on Kill Sky
God’s hammer were like suns. The weapon was striking toward
space.</p>
<p>The god symbol that was hanging in space suddenly branded space
with a god symbol.</p>
<p>In the next second, the symbol shattered. As the symbol
shattered, everything inside the symbol turned to dust. It did not
matter if it was a planet or sun. Although it did not explode, it
released energy. In just a second it had become a substance.</p>
