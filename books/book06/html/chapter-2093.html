<p>“Mister Lone Bamboo, I’ve heard that you are in a rush to find
me. What is the matter?” Sleepless Duke asked Lone Bamboo.</p>
<p>“Kahn delivered some special goods to you. I would like to know
what they are.” Lone Bamboo told her directly.</p>
<p>Sleepless Duke sighed and said, “I suppose there is no use
hiding anything. The goods Kahn gave me were a bunch of living
creatures.”</p>
<p>“Why would you do that?” Lone Bamboo asked.</p>
<p>“You should both know that after we eat living creatures, our
mental fortitude may develop problems,” Sleepless Duke said
tiredly. “Eating them is indeed a very dangerous thing for us to
do.”</p>
<p>Then why are you buying them?” Han Sen asked.</p>
<p>“It is simple: if I don’t eat living creatures, then I will
never improve. We level up faster that way. Without eating living
creatures, our gain of power is slow. I am a Duke, and if I don’t
eat living creatures, I will not become a King. This is our goal,
is it not? No matter how much treasure I am given, I will never
level up. Eating living creatures is the only way to accomplish
this.” Sleepless Duke spoke with a mournful voice.</p>
<p>“Are you or one of the creatures responsible for the murders?”
Lone Bamboo frowned.</p>
<p>“One of the living ones escaped. I was afraid of Sky Palace
finding out, and so I did not report it.” Sleepless Duke gave a wry
smile. “I never thought things would come to this. I thought that
since this was taking place on Planet Night Ghost, I could find the
foe quickly and kill it. But I have failed to find it, and as a
result, so many innocents have lost their lives.</p>
<p>I cannot hide this any longer.”</p>
<p>“What is the creature that escaped you?” Han Sen asked Sleepless
Duke.</p>
<p>“I do not know.” Sleepless Duke shook her head.</p>
<p>Han Sen’s voice grew hard. “How could you not know? You were the
buyer! How can you not know what you were buying?”</p>
<p>Sleepless Duke’s expression was bitter now. “I needed high-level
creatures. I couldn’t go for something too big, as I would be found
out. There weren’t many that were suitable for purchase, so my
requirements weren’t strict. I asked for anything that was a Duke.
I checked the receipt, and one of them said it was a crystallizer.
It did look like a crystallizer, but how could it be that
powerful?”</p>
<p>“Crystallizer?” Han Sen frowned. He did not expect this would
have something to do with a crystallizer.</p>
<p>Sleepless Duke went on to say, “A crystallizer cannot escape
from its cage and kill so many Night Ghosts without leaving a
trail. I think it must have been a race that merely looked like a
crystallizer. I tried to confirm this with Kahn, but he told me it
was just a Duke crystallizer, and that he did not know anything
further.”</p>
<p>Sleepless Duke started to say something more, then
hesitated.</p>
<p>“Say it,” Lone Bamboo commanded.</p>
<p>Sleepless Duke hesitated again, but she went on to say, “It is
rare to see a crystallizer in the geno universe. I don’t know too
much about them. I have searched for information about them after
the murders began, but there is little to learn. One strange thing,
however, is that crystallizer blood should be red. The crystallizer
that was sent here, however, had blue blood.”</p>
<p>“Blue blood?” Han Sen jumped.</p>
<p>Yes, blue blood. It was injured when it was sent here, and it
was bleeding. It looked as if it had been badly damaged, and that
was why I planned on eating it first. So, I removed the spell that
had been put on him, and I locked him in a room. But when I was
ready to eat and went there to see him, he was gone. Nothing in the
room was damaged or out of place. It was as if he had just
vanished.”</p>
<p>“Take us there,” Han Sen said.</p>
<p>The blueblood crystallizer sounded an awful lot like a Blood
Legion member. They looked just like crystallizers, so anyone in
the geno universe would assume that’s what they were. And
furthermore, blue blood was exclusive to members of Blood Legion.
Crystallizers and humans were supposed to have red blood.</p>
<p>Sleepless Duke brought Han Sen and Lone Bamboo to the prison
cell. Han Sen used his Dongxuan Aura, but he couldn’t catch the
trace of anyone other than Sleepless Duke.</p>
<p>You really locked him in here?” Han Sen looked at Sleepless
Duke. An injured creature must have left a substance behind, and it
would at least be dripping blood.</p>
<p>Yes. He left some blood behind, but I cleaned it up.” Sleepless
Duke brought out a box and showed it to Han Sen and Lone
Bamboo.</p>
<p>Lone Bamboo, when seeing it, frowned. “That is its blood?”</p>
<p>Han Sen’s eyebrows rose. It was just a blue crystal in a box,
and the crystal looked similar to Han Sen’s own crystal blood.</p>
<p>“I feel strange, knowing that its blood turned to crystal. They
are crystallizers, but they aren’t supposed to have this ability.
It’s what has got me thinking that he isn’t actually a
crystallizer,” Sleepless Duke said.</p>
<p>Han Sen picked up the blue crystal from the box. He knew that it
was indeed a blueblood crystal. And just like his own blood, it
left no molecules behind for him to detect. That was why he could
not find a trace.</p>
<p>“It looks like the person Kahn sent was from Blood Legion,” Han
Sen guessed to himself.</p>
<p>“Gentlemen, what I have told you is the truth. If you want to
punish someone, punish me. But this has nothing to do with my
people. Please help them and find the creature responsible. It
cannot be allowed to kill more Night Ghosts,” Sleepless Duke
begged.</p>
<p>You’re coming with us to talk to Kahn. We have to find out where
he got that crystallizer Duke from. If we find out who he is, we
will be able to take action,” Han Sen said to Sleepless Duke.</p>
<p>“Okay, I will follow you.” Sleepless Duke really was eager to
cooperate.</p>
<p>Han Sen went back to the Taurus base, but when they reached it,
the gate had already been smashed open. They ran in, and they found
black water and scattered bits of armor all over the place. The
armor belonged to the Taurus.</p>
<p>They ran in and soon noticed that not a single Taurus had
survived the assault.</p>
<p>Pang! A noise echoed out of a nearby hallway.</p>
<p>“What is that place?” Han Sen asked Sleepless Duke.</p>
<p>“That is their company’s warehouse,” Sleepless Duke said.</p>
<p>The three ventured toward it. After a few turns, they did indeed
reach a very large warehouse. Outside it, Kahn was fighting a
human-looking man.</p>
