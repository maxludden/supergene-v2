<p>The Dukes didn’t look at the blade in the same way Han Sen had.
They all looked at it for less than a minute before handing it back
over to Black-Moon King. The entire thing was done in a few
minutes.</p>
<p>The young ones were not allowed to look at it by themselves.
After they had all seen it, the ceremony came to a close.
Black-Moon King invited a few Kings and Dukes over for tea. Some
accepted and stayed, others declined and left.</p>
<p>Black Steel invited Rebecca and a few of the other young ones to
the garden for a chat, Han Sen included.</p>
<p>So, Han Sen followed Black Steel to the garden. There, he sat
down. Aside from Han Sen, everyone seemed to be acquainted with one
another. So, there was no formal etiquette to follow.</p>
<p>Without Black-Moon King around, they were prone to speaking far
more openly than they ordinarily would. As they began chatting, not
a single person was left out. But with that being said, Han Sen did
not say a word. Han Sen did not know anyone there except for Black
Steel, and so he retreated into his mind to mull over what he had
learned with the knife. He didn’t care for their topics of
conversation.</p>
<p>Du Lishe, noticing that Han Sen wasn’t speaking with them,
hummed and said, “Genius Han, you looked at Narrow Moon Knife for
so long. And you kept saying it was so good, you could obviously
detect something we could not. Why don’t you tell us what you saw,
so that we too can learn it.”</p>
<p>After Du Lishe said that, everyone turned to look at Han Sen.
They were curious whether Han Sen really had learned something, or
if it was all some sort of act.</p>
<p>Han Sen’s eyes were closed, still reviewing what he had learned.
He hadn’t noticed Du Lishe was talking to him. His eyes were shut
tight, and it appeared as if he was ignoring her.</p>
<p>Du Lishe, noticing him ignoring her, looked mad and did not say
anything more.</p>
<p>Du Lishe’s silence did not mean others wouldn’t say anything,
though. She was Moon Wheel King’s second daughter. She was pretty,
and she was talented. She had many admirers.</p>
<p>The young ones that sat there with them were admirers of Rebecca
and Du Lishe. Now that Han Sen had apparently ignored her, someone
could not help but stand up for her.</p>
<p>“Didn’t he tell you what he saw?” a Viscount called Kriman asked
dubiously.</p>
<p>“What did he say?” Du Lishe asked.</p>
<p>Everyone looked at Kriman, but everyone knew he wasn’t going to
say anything nice.</p>
<p>Kriman laughed. “Didn’t you grow ears? Genius Han said it was a
good knife. He said it many times.”</p>
<p>Kriman spoke it in the tone Han Sen had, and Du Lishe laughed.
“Ha!”</p>
<p>Kriman over-enunciated his words, laughing at Han Sen and
pretending to understand, which made many people there laugh. The
elegant ones smiled.</p>
<p>Han Sen sat where he was without emotion. He was deep in
thought. He was afraid that occupying his mind with something else
for a while would make him forget important details. So, he still
did not hear them.</p>
<p>Han Sen continued to ignore the group. Black Steel frowned and
said, “Han Sen has his reasons for viewing the knife the way he
did.”</p>
<p>Black Steel did not know how to participate in that particular
debate, so this was what he said.</p>
<p>Kriman did not respect Black Steel. He only wanted to stand up
for Du Lishe in the hopes of getting closer to her, and so he said,
“Black Steel, you know knives. Similar actions from you might make
sense, but I can’t feel the same for other people. He looked at it
for half an hour, repeating the same two sentences over and over.
If he is not educated, don’t pretend he is. This is the first time
I’ve ever seen someone so dumb.”</p>
<p>“Kriman, mind your tongue.” Black Steel’s face looked grim.</p>
<p>Kriman smiled and said, “I don’t beat around the bush. If I have
said something that is incorrect, then you can have him point out
the mistake. If he can convince everyone, I will earnestly
apologize.”</p>
<p>Sad Night and Night Giant King, who had a grudge with Han Sen,
looked over angrily and said, “Yes! If he saw something, let us
hear what it is that he saw. If it makes sense, then we will
apologize, too. What is the point in just saying that the knife was
good, over and over.”</p>
<p>Black Steel could see Han Sen still sitting where he was, not
saying a word. He touched him and said, “If you are willing to, you
can tell people.”</p>
<p>Black Steel understood Han Sen. He knew Han Sen had seen
something the others hadn’t, and that was why he stared at it for
so long. What Han Sen saw wasn’t anyone else’s business, of course.
Black Steel would not push Han Sen to explain if he wasn’t willing
to.</p>
<p>But now that the people were saying things like this, Black
Steel could not stand by and watch. He was worried for Han Sen. If
Han Sen did not say something, his reputation would suffer. No one
ever let a person’s reputation go.</p>
<p>Outsiders had a tough life in Narrow Moon. Han Sen had built
himself a good reputation. Black Steel thought it would be a shame
if it was destroyed now.</p>
<p>After being touched by Black Steel, Han Sen woke up from his
daze. Han Sen looked confused, hearing what he said. And so, he
asked, “Tell people what?”</p>
<p>He hadn’t heard anything else that had been spoken. All he had
heard was what Black Steel had spoken to him.</p>
<p>But when that went into the ears of Kriman and the others, they
misunderstood. They thought Han Sen was admitting he didn’t know or
see anything. Hence why he had nothing to say.</p>
<p>Kriman laughed and said, “Black Steel, you heard him. I didn’t
misplace my blame. I admire Genius Han for one thing only: his
shamelessness. He didn’t learn anything, despite staring at it for
half an hour. I couldn’t bring myself to do such a thing.”</p>
<p>Sad Night coldly laughed and said, “Because he is a genius,
isn’t that right? He isn’t like us. He is already so smart, he was
able to tell us the shocking fact that it was a good knife. What
more can we expect?”</p>
<p>Han Sen heard that and quickly understood what was going on
without even needing to ask Black Steel.</p>
<p>Seeing Kriman and Sad Night speak, Han Sen coldly said, “I won’t
tell you, but my teacher did teach me something. Instead of using
words, I can perform, and what I perform will make you smile.”</p>
<p>“We would like to see what shocking performance you could do for
us. You are not going to perform the astounding Speech of Good
again, are you?” Kriman spoke strangely.</p>
<p>He thought Han Sen was changing the topic, hence why he was
repeating the same insults. He didn’t want Han Sen to escape
this.</p>
<p>Han Sen smiled. He casually said, “I learned a geno art called
Moon.”</p>
