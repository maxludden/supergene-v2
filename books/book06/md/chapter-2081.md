  After the Turtle light blasted through the flying xenogeneics, scores of them fell to the ground.

Han Sen had shown himself to be a threat, and so a Blue Gold Demon Bug screamed. Many of the xenogeneics under its control turned toward Han Sen. Before Han Sen could fire off another rocket, though, many Duke and Marquise xenogeneics were already in front of him.

Han Sen used a petrifying shockwave to step back and get some distance, turning all the xenogeneics in a five- hundred-meter radius into stone.

Although he couldn’t petrify the stronger ones completely, he slowed them enough to buy some time.

Pang! Pang! Pang! Pang!

Han Sen ran forward, unleashing petrifying shockwaves with every footfall. They didn’t deal that much damage, but they did slow the xenogeneics down. Wherever Han Sen went, things got quiet.

“Follow Han Sen!” Overbearing Teeth Duke shouted, and one hundred Dukes raced after Han Sen. Their knives and their swordlights were shining. They killed many of the temporarily-petrified high-level xenogeneics.

They only killed the ones that were a danger to them, though. They ignored the bulk of the xenogeneic horde, following Han Sen as he made his way to the Blue Gold Demon Bugs.

Screams echoed in the skies as a Blue Gold Demon Bug commanded its xenogeneics to summon more power to stop Han Sen’s advance. The Duke and Marquise xenogeneics under its control released their power in a single, concentrated burst.

Han Sen saw the attack coming, and he knew he couldn’t block it. Overbearing Teeth had seen what was happening, too, and he barked, “Careful!”

Han Sen flapped his dragon wings and disappeared, and that frightening attack cratered the place he had been only moments before. Han Sen reappeared right beside the Blue Gold Demon Bugs. He used another petrifying shockwave, and the nearby Blue Gold Demon Bugs and xenogeneics were turned to stone. Han Sen followed that up by immediately firing a rocket. Turtle symbols appeared on all the bugs and xenogeneics, sending them plummeting to the earth below.

Overbearing Teeth grinned and began killing the bugs that were petrified by the Turtle light. Metallic limbs and gore were strewn everywhere in his wake.

The Blue Gold Demon Bugs were weaker after suffering the petrification and Turtle spell. They could not fight back against the Dukes. The bugs had once been difficult to kill, but now they were slain with ease.

Han Sen teleported back and forth across the battlefield. Every time he appeared, a new shockwave would roll out to petrify all their opponents. He also made frequent use of his rocket launcher.

Many Blue Gold Demon Bugs had to endure the petrification and Turtle effects. Overbearing Teeth Duke followed Han Sen closing, cutting up the enemies he left behind. They killed so many bugs, making their cries drown out the sound of all else.

Now the bugs felt that they were facing a real threat, and they recalled many of the xenogeneics they had sent across the city. The new enemy troops intensified the pressure on Han Sen and the others, but the rest of the city instantly became safer.

Han Sen’s power was at a level where it would still be very difficult for him to kill the high-class bugs. Killing a Duke would not be easy for him.

But he was happy to leave the killing to others. He chose to play smart, focusing on speed, teleportation, petrification shockwave casting, and the rockets that dished out Turtle spells. He flashed around the battlefield, letting Overbearing Teeth Duke and the others finish off the foes he brought down.

Han Sen was guiding a regiment of one hundred Dukes. They were like a weapon of his own—one that could brutally impale the hearts of all the enemies he came across. Many Blue Gold Demon Bugs died by their hands, and there was little chance of the ones remaining having a chance of escape.

Han Sen flowed between the monsters like water. The petrifying shockwaves continued to spread, peppered with the explosions of the rockets he fired. They were the brightest things on the battlefield.

Wherever Han Sen went, the Dukes killed everything in their path. Blood and bodies were everywhere, and the attacks of the bugs were slowing down.

“No wonder Han Sen was able to kill Sharon and Dragon Thirteen! That guy is scary.” said a shocked voice.

Rebecca and Du Lishe were in shock, too. The city was getting quieter, and they saw that the hope of victory was not too far away.

“Kill! Kill! Kill! Kill!”

Han Sen was like the conductor of an orchestra. His entire body was the wild baton used for dictation, and wherever he went, death followed.

Han Sen lost track of how long he had been leading the killing. Many Blue Gold Demon Bugs were slain by the Dukes he led. And before long, the xenogeneics started to run.

The only bad thing about all this was the fact that he had been striking the monsters with rockets all that time, and the only kills he had registered to himself were those of the lower level foes. The Dukes had killed all the high-level enemies. Due to his lack of kills, Han Sen had been robbed of the chance to procure high-class beast souls.

But given how dire the situation had gotten, Han Sen couldn’t be too upset about it. He disabled the Blue Gold Demon Bugs as quickly as he could. Countless numbers of them died every second, and with that focus, he hardly had the time to think, anyway.

The moonlight was bright like snow. He killed creatures without thinking.

The entire planet became a killing hell. Blood was spilled across the place, and limbs were scattered everywhere. The bodies of xenogeneics built up like mountain ranges.

The fights out in space were still going on, too. Han Sen heard a familiar voice come from the cosmos before long, breaking through the atmosphere. It was a voice that sounded like the roaring of an angry monster, and it slammed into a blue light. That blue light fell like a meteor covered in purple air.

Boom!

The ground shook, and nearby hills were leveled. The blue light erupted like a volcano from the mountain.

Yisha’s body sundered the atmosphere before that mountain. Her pretty face had turned to one scored with a lust for murder. She held a long white knife, drenched in purple air. When her hand moved, it was like she was tearing a hole in the universe itself.

Boom!

There was a deafening noise. The ground was scarred with a knifemark that went on for a few hundred miles. That blue light began to crack, but it made some marks that resembled a chrysanthemum.

Yisha’s face looked cold, and her attacks made the skies above her shudder. Onlookers began to worry that she might end up cutting the planet in half.

Katcha!

There was a strange noise, as if something had broken.

Within the haze of dust and debris, Han Sen saw two blue lights falling away from each other. When he looked closer, he saw that the half-deified Blue Gold Demon Bug had been hewn in two by Yisha.

Its body had been riddled with a number of wounds, but the deadliest sliced from its shoulder to its waist. That was the strike that cut the beast in half.
