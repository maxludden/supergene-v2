<p>Han Sen and the others retraced their steps back to the Lost Land. There was not much resistance to slow their return travel. They left the big barren system with ease.</p>

<p>On their way back to the Extreme King, Han Sen had been mulling over this question quite a bit. Tai Yi that was mentioned in the scroll. Was that the Tai Yi that Bao&#8217;er and the others saw?&quot;</p>

<p>When they had been digging in God City, they dug up a strange stone. When Han Sen and the others went into the God City, Bao&#8217;er said a man appeared. He announced his name as Tai Yi. He even told her to say hello to her father.</p>

<p>When Bao&#8217;er told Han Sen about it, he felt weirded out too. According to Bao&#8217;er&#8217;s description of him, Han Sen did not know who Tai Yi fellow could have been. He had heard the name Tai Yi before, but it was the Tai Yi King God in the sanctuaries. It was clearly not the same guy who called himself Tai Yi now.</p>

<p>Back then, Han Sen was still wondering about how Tai Yi knew about Bao&#8217;er&#8217;s history. The father he mentioned should have been Bao&#8217;er&#8217;s true biological father.</p>

<p>Ever since then, he had not heard anything about the person known as Tai Yi again. After a prolonged amount of time, Han Sen had almost completely forgotten about him.</p>

<p>Now, he had been mentioned in Holy Kirin&#8217;s drawing scroll. Han Sen had seen Tai Yi&#8217;s name and the three words &#8220;killing the gods.&#8221; That made Han Sen start guessing more about the nature of Tai Yi&#8217;s identity.</p>

<p>But guesses were little more than guesses. He did not even know if the Tai Yi in the drawing was the same one as the Tai Yi he had heard about. It was difficult for him to confirm anything.</p>

<p>Han Sen followed Second Uncle and the others to the Extreme King. On their way, the deified elites treated Han Sen completely differently. They admired him as if he was a god instead.</p>

<p>This had been the best way for Han Sen to leave the Extreme King, but he had opted to not abandon them just yet. He followed them back to the Extreme King.</p>

<p>Han Sen thought, If I leave now, the Extreme King will talk about me killing a god. I am afraid the scary existences in the geno hall might come after me. If I go back to the Extreme King now, they will think I am a part of them. I do not think they will tell anyone the story about me killing Evil Lotus God. It would just bring trouble to the Extreme King. Plus, the Extreme King has a lot of deified xenogeneics for me to kill. There is no point in me leaving now.</p>

<p>He used to think he was a bit too weak to stay in the Extreme King. Now that he had the perfect Cold Light Sword, he did not have to worry as much.</p>

<p>With Cold Light Sword&#8217;s power, even if he could not fight against true god elites, he could still fight back a little.</p>

<p>Han Sen was playing with the purple evil lotus, thinking of a way in which he might be able to hurt it. It is a shame those two god spirit genes cannot be refined. If I was able to refine one of them, perhaps I could achieve true god power straight away.</p>

<p>After he went back to the Extreme King, he kept munching on his deified genes. Bai King summoned him. He was with Second Uncle and the others. They reported what had occurred in the big barren system.</p>

<p>That was about all that happened. Bai King did not ask why Han Sen had that power, nor did he ask Han Sen to hand over the god&#8217;s personality and the scroll.</p>

<p>Ever since that happened, it was like nothing had changed. Han Sen did not see Bai King again. Only Bao Ying would come to teach him manners every day.</p>

<p>Han Sen thought, What is this Bai King thinking? If I wanted to run, I would have run. I have so many secrets in me, yet he is not showing interest. Even with treasures like the god&#8217;s personality, he hasn&#8217;t asked about it. What is he truly after?</p>

<p>If Bai King had some kind of plan to test him, Han Sen would have felt more convinced. If his opponent was willing to show his cards, he would at least have a way to sort the matter out. But Bai King was not showing his cards, which made Han Sen completely confused. He thought Bai King was a very mysterious character and a difficult person to understand.</p>

<p>After a while, every day for Han Sen was just a day in which he ate and slept and slept and ate. His deified gene tallies were greatly increasing. Before long, it reached a hundred.</p>

<p>It is time to become larva class. I hope that after I become larva class, my body will become normal again. Han Sen was happy, but he did not immediately become larva class.</p>

<p>This place belonged to the Extreme King, and his identity was that of the Holy Baby. If he strove to become larva class and looked like the real Han Sen again, it would have been like feeding a sheep directly into a tiger&#8217;s mouth.</p>

<p>Fortunately, Bai King did not restrict his freedom. Han Sen found an excuse and took a battleship from the Extreme King to leave the kingdom. He found a planet that was owned by the Extreme King but had no one there. While he was there, he started to evolve his battle body.</p>

<p>When the evolution began, Han Sen felt as if his gene messages kept changing. His cells kept splitting and changing.</p>

<p>Slowly, Han Sen&#8217;s body kept getting bigger. It wasn&#8217;t much longer until he returned to his adult self.</p>

<p>Han Sen still kept the xenogeneic battle body mode. His body looked weirdly pretty because he had combined with Spell. It made his face look as soft as a woman&#8217;s.</p>

<p>I finally became an adult again! Han Sen was so happy. He did not have a fetish to be a child, so he was now much more comfortable.</p>

<p>Han Sen had successfully become larva class. He felt as if his power had returned. He enjoyed that powerful power a lot. It was much more powerful than if he relied on using the Sky Star Wolf glyph.</p>

<p>This is the real me. Han Sen felt very cocky. When he tried to cancel his xenogeneic mode, he found out he was unable to.</p>

<p>Do I have to be like this from now on? Han Sen felt kind of depressed, but there was no other way.</p>

<p>Although he looked much prettier now, Han Sen still wanted his old face back.</p>

<p>Right now, I am much more powerful. I wonder if I can open the scroll. Han Sen took out the scroll. He generated power and tried to pull open the scroll again.</p>

<p>The scroll slowly opened. Once again, he saw Tai Yi&#8217;s name. Because Han Sen&#8217;s power was stronger than when he used Sky Star Wolf glyph, the scroll could now be slowly opened.</p>

<p>Here it is&#8230; Here it is&#8230; There is that text again&#8230; As Han Sen looked at the scroll that was being opened, he saw another line of words appear.</p>

<p>&#8220;Purple Fight&#8230; Killing the gods&#8230;&#8221; When Han Sen saw the name, he was shocked.</p>

<p>Tai Yi could have the same name and surname, but Purple Fight would not have the same name. The elites that used that name in the universe would only be the renowned Purple Fight of Sacred&#8217;s 10 generals.</p>

<p>Han Sen had seen Purple Fight before, but Purple Fight was not doing so well now. He was riding the Sea Demon Car in Tianxia System, wandering there forever.</p>

<p>After the woman, who called herself a sacred researcher, left Two Worlds Mountain, Purple Fight was gone too.</p>
