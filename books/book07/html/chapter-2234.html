<h2>I Am Afraid You Will Be Disappointed</h2>
<h3>Chapter 2234</h3>

<p>Han Sen moved his body and summoned both sets of dragon
wings—the ones on his back and the ones behind his ears. He held
Bao’er and evaded Night River King’s black water wheel attack.</p>
<p>Night River King looked crazy, and he roared, “Let’s send them
to hell so they can wait for you.”</p>
<p>The pair of Moon Wheel Blades did not lessen in their strength,
and they kept creating scary black water wheels to send after Ji
Qing and the others.</p>
<p>“I am afraid you will be disappointed.” Han Sen looked at him
mockingly.</p>
<p>Pang!</p>
<p>A gold shield arose from Han Yan. It was the fourth Demon Bug
King Bai Sema. It was not damaged by his attack, as the gold Bai
Sema protected them and prohibited the black water wheels from
reaching them.</p>
<p>Many giant black water wheels came down on the gold Bai Sema,
spinning in a bid to cut through it. But try as they might, they
could not cut through the surface of the new gold Bai Sema.</p>
<p>“Damn it! He still has one more of those treasures?” Night River
King felt so angry. And in addition to that, he felt hopeless and
sad.</p>
<p>He had done everything he could to try and kill Han Sen, but
every attempt had failed. He hadn’t even managed to hurt him in the
least. The presence of the gold Demon Bug King Bai Sema had hurt
his confidence quite a bit. Without the help of the Ancient Warrior
Statue, his power was not enough to break through the shield. His
plan had completely failed. No one expected Han Sen to possess four
of those treasures, and no one expected the tricolored shield to
block a deified’s attack.</p>
<p>But quickly, Night River King did find himself some hope, and
that was because he saw Han Sen coming for him. He hadn’t hidden
himself inside the gold Demon Bug King Bai Sema for protection.</p>
<p>“I don’t think you have a fifth shield treasure.” Night River
King looked ugly as he roared. His body exploded with a burst of
power as black water started popping off in every direction. The
Moon Wheel Blade he was wielding was carrying a black water wheel
toward Han Sen.</p>
<p>Han Sen’s dragon wings flapped. He teleported past the black
water wheel and rushed to Night River King.</p>
<p>Night River King was so angry, and his blade was so fast. The
black water wheels appeared everywhere. They were headed for Han
Sen with an ardent desire to cut him up into pieces.</p>
<p>Han Sen cast his Dongxuan Aura and used the Purple-Eye
Butterfly, and then he teleported again. His speed and power
wouldn’t be up to Night River King’s par.</p>
<p>Dodging Night River King’s attacks were very difficult, of
course. He had to count on his judgment and prediction abilities
and use Break Space Flash to evade each and every black water
wheel. By doing so, Han Sen came nearer and nearer to Night River
King.</p>
<p>Ten thousand meters… five thousand meters… three thousand
meters… two thousand meters… one thousand meters…</p>
<p>Night River King’s mad attacks could not prevent Han Sen from
inching his way forward. Finally, when Han Sen was only five
hundred meters away from Night River King, Han Sen roared. He held
his Ghost Teeth Knife and brought up the demonic knife air. He
slashed toward Night River King.</p>
<p>“You underestimate the power of one who is King class.” Night
River King was incredibly angry from Han Sen’s provocations. The
Moon Wheel Blade slashed toward Han Sen with a black water wheel
spinning like crazy at its tip. It looked as if it were going to
cut the world and Han Sen open.</p>
<p>Night River King did not think Han Sen was an equal opponent.
Without those horrible shields of his, Han Sen was little more than
a cheap ant before him. Now that the ant sought to challenge him,
it made Night River King angry, but it also gave him hope. He could
not hide the fact that he had come to kill Han Sen. Even if he did
kill Han Sen, his teammates would spread word that he had broken
the shield and everything, but if he killed Han Sen and retrieved
the item Edward wanted…</p>
<p>Night River King could discuss striking a deal with Edward and
Ice Blue Knight King. Edward was willing to sacrifice an Ancient
God statue for the item he wished to retrieve, so the item must be
something good enough to keep him alive.</p>
<p>As Han Sen’s knife air came to hit the black water wheel, Han
Sen put away the knife air and teleported. This time, Han Sen
teleported behind Night River King by a distance of about ten
meters.</p>
<p>“Death wish.” Night River King knew exactly where Han Sen had
appeared, and the moment Han Sen did appear, he slashed backwards
toward him.</p>
<p>“It was too close,” Night River King thought. He didn’t believe
Han Sen could teleport away now.</p>
<p>When he slashed, Night River King moved and saw Han Sen exactly
there. He had only just finished teleporting, so it was too late to
avoid the slash.</p>
<p>“Die!” Night River King roared like mad.</p>
<p>“Bao’er!” Han Sen did not move. His red body floated in the air,
and he did not dodge Night River King. He only called Bao’er’s
name.</p>
<p>Bao’er was sitting on Han Sen’s shoulder, and she was clutching
a white jade drum. Her little hand hit the drum.</p>
<p>Night River King acknowledged the jade drum was from Planet Jade
Drum, and it made his face change. He had spent all his power on
the attacks, and he did not have enough reserves to repel the Jade
Drum’s sonic power.</p>
<p>But Night River King did not think a Jade Drum could do much of
anything, because it was only Duke class. It was difficult for one
to ever be King class.</p>
<p>With a King class body, he should have totally been able to
withstand the Jade Drum’s sonic force and then kill Han Sen. It was
okay to allow himself to be hit by the sonic power.</p>
<p>While Night River King was thinking, he saw Bao’er’s hand fall
upon the Jade Drum, but the Jade Drum was different to the ones he
could recall. There was a red scorpion printed on it.</p>
<p>Before Night River King could think again, though, a loud drum
noise sounded inside his head.</p>
<p>Dong!</p>
<p>Night River King felt as if his head had been pierced by a steel
rod all the way from his head right through his entire body. He
felt as if his head were empty, and he could not compose a clear
thought after listening to the noise. He brought his hands up to
clutch his head as he screamed.</p>
<p>While Night River King was broken, the black water wheel that
was about to hit Han Sen faded.</p>
<p>At that close range, a King class elite could not hope to block
the power of a Blood Scorpion Jade Drum, especially without a
defensive effort. Han Sen knew this because he had tested it while
he was on Planet Jade Drum.</p>
<p>“Night River King, our feud really should end here.” Han Sen’s
Ghost Teeth Knife was carrying a scary knife air. It came slashing
at Night River King, who was screaming while he clutched his
head.</p>
<p>Night River King wanted to kill Han Sen, and Han Sen wanted to
kill Night River King.</p>
<p>A scary knife air came across Night River King’s throat. The
power could break a mountain, but on Night River King’s neck, it
only imparted a light knife mark. Blood was drawn by the blade, but
a complete slit of the throat was not achieved.</p>
<p>A King class body was far stronger than a Marquise’s. The slash
could not cut through Night River King’s entire neck; it could only
just hurt him. But the pain brought Night River King a bit of
lucidity.</p>
<p>Dong!</p>
<p>But before Night River King’s head started to run again, another
noise was heard. It made Night River King’s head buzz once more. It
felt like someone had used a hammer to batter his head and then dig
his brain out. He screamed again.</p>
<p>Bao’er’s hand came down on the Blood Scorpion Jade Drum, and she
did not stop there. Her hands alternated to hit the Jade Drum
continuously.</p>
