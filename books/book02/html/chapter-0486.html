    <p>
      After absorbing the red crystal, Han Sen had gained stronger brainpower
      although the ability to move things was not that useful.
    </p>

    <p>
      The countless details of the entire battlefield were clearly projected in
      Han Sen&#8217;s mind, making it easier for him to make a precise judgment.
    </p>

    <p>
      When he made the first step, Han Sen had calculated his route to go
      forward and all the possibilities on the way, including the reactions of
      different creatures.
    </p>

    <p>
      Although it could not be 100% accurate, Han Sen knew it was the best route
      he could have chosen.
    </p>

    <p>
      The evolvers fighting were all paying attention to the figure deep into
      the creature army, wishing for the impossible to happen.
    </p>

    <p>
      At this point, Han Sen&#8217;s performance had just begun. The moment he
      sent himself into the group of creatures, the entire battlefield had
      become a huge chessboard for Han Sen.
    </p>

    <p>
      Every single creature, including the royal spirit herself was pieces on
      the chessboard for Han Sen. And his end goal was to take out the piece
      represented by the royal spirit.
    </p>

    <p>
      Those fierce creatures were attacking Han Sen, but his eyes were extremely
      calm. Moving his legs rapidly, he was going forward according to the route
      he had designed.
    </p>

    <p>
      Tempting, misleading, or killing directly, Han Sen could not be stopped by
      the group of creatures. In the impossible situation, Han Sen made a
      possible route which led to the royal spirit. The scenario was incredible
      in other people&#8217;s eyes. Thousands of creatures were simply a sea of
      heads without even a gap. In others' eyes, unless all the creatures were
      wiped out, it was impossible to approach the royal spirit.
    </p>

    <p>
      However, after Han Sen went there, he moved left and right at an
      incredible speed. Flashing his right hand, one creature after another were
      bleeding heavily and many were beheaded, which was not even the best part.
    </p>

    <p>
      The best part was that initially many creatures were actually in Han
      Sen&#8217;s way, but for some reason, they suddenly moved their bodies to
      let him pass.
    </p>

    <p>
      In the crazy group of beasts, Han Sen was like a butterfly dancing solo.
      Although he was in a terrible situation, the elegance and beauty of his
      figure were not affected.
    </p>

    <p>
      In the most incredible way, thousands of gruesome creatures failed to stop
      Han Sen. Through a huge army, Han Sen managed to go up to the royal
      spirit&#8217;s mount, the dragon snake.
    </p>

    <p>
      Many people were completely dumbstruck. It was like a thrilling magic
      show. The blood and the strange rhythm made one&#8217;s heart leapt with
      the beat.
    </p>

    <p>Boom!</p>

    <p>
      The moment Han Sen was in front of the dragon snake, the silver-haired
      young lady had a cold smile on her face. The rock underneath Han Sen
      suddenly split. A black gargoyle looking like a ghost emerged from
      underground, its cold hands grabbing at Han Sen&#8217;s legs which were
      right in front of its face.
    </p>

    <p>
      Almost at the same time, the giant dragon snake opened its mouth to
      swallow Han Sen.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Dammit, the spirit is so wicked that she hid a sacred-blood
      gargoyle underneath.&#8221;
    </p>

    <p>&#8220;That is the end of it…&#8221;</p>

    <p>
      People who had seen some hope suddenly lost faith. Attacked by the
      sacred-blood gargoyle, snapped by the dragon snake, and surrounded by
      fierce creatures, the person had nowhere to go.
    </p>

    <p>
      Cold light flashed in Han Sen&#8217;s eyes. He suddenly jumped up,
      disregarding the gargoyle and throwing himself into the mouth of the giant
      dragon snake.
    </p>

    <p>
      Evolvers who were watching this scene couldn&#8217;t help feeling sad.
      Their hope was almost all gone. This was a desperate move. However, the
      dragon snake was so big that it could simply swallow the man. The claws
      were so small that they were not enough to threaten this giant creature.
      Even if he could hit the creature, the cut would only be a scratch to its
      gigantic body. Maybe he would not even be able to break the snakeskin.
    </p>

    <p>
      As Han Sen was about to be swallowed by the dragon snake, his body
      suddenly paused in the air and rose a couple of feet. Stepping on the
      snake&#8217;s nose with his right foot, he rose higher at an incredible
      speed to the same height as the royal spirit standing on the head of the
      snake.
    </p>

    <p>
      The royal spirit blinked and moved her staff slightly. Silver light
      covered her whole body, turning her into a warrior covered in silver armor
      and her staff into a slim silver sword.
    </p>

    <p>
      Without any expression, her delicate fingers moved, and the slim silver
      sword was stabbed to Han Sen&#8217;s forehead like a lightning bolt.
    </p>

    <p>
      Fast, incredibly fast. There was no time for him to react. Behind Han Sen,
      the sacred-blood gargoyle appeared like a phantom, its hands grabbing at
      Han Sen&#8217;s legs from behind.
    </p>

    <p>
      The snake also spit out its tongue looking like a trident to hit Han
      Sen&#8217;s waist.
    </p>

    <p>
      In other people&#8217;s eyes, Han Sen was faced with a death trap.
      However, from Han Sen&#8217;s perspective, this was his opportunity.
    </p>

    <p>
      All the planning, the careful design, and the performance were for this
      moment.
    </p>

    <p>
      His heart thumping like thunder, Han Sen used Heresy Mantra to its full.
      Overload made his bones squeak. Read armor appeared on Han Sen&#8217;s
      body as the Ruby crown appeared on his head. His black shorthair became
      blonde and long, dancing in the air like crazy. His eyes which were now
      golden were completely emotionless.
    </p>

    <p>
      As he shapeshifted into the fairy queen, everything became slower in Han
      Sen&#8217;s eyes. The sneak attack of the sacred-blood gargoyle, the
      tongue blade of the snake, the slim silver sword of the royal spirit, and
      the countless creatures throwing themselves at him, all became a
      holographic image in Han Sen&#8217;s brain, even the slightest details of
      which could be learned by him.
    </p>

    <p>
      Without moving away, Han Sen who was now at his best thrust his chest to
      the slim sword of the silver-haired spirit girl without hesitation,
      letting the sword pierce his chest and approaching the spirit at the same
      time.
    </p>

    <p>
      They were so close to each other that Han Sen&#8217;s face was about to
      touch hers.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen smiled, waving his right hand and cutting the three purple claws
      into the pretty head of the spirit girl. With her incredulous look, her
      head was cut into four parts.
    </p>

    <p>Boom!</p>

    <p>
      The figure of the spirit girl became twinkles of lights and disappeared.
      Suddenly, the entire battlefield seemed to freeze. Both humans and
      creatures stopped a beat.
    </p>

    <p>
      All eyes were on the gorgeous figure. The red armor and Ruby crown were
      shining in the sun so bright that people could hardly look at them.
