<p>“Can it fly while carrying heavy items?” Han Sen asked,
examining the bird.</p>
<p>“Yes; it is much stronger than Baron class Jade Night Cranes,
but it has no legs and its wings are damaged,” Yun Suyi repeated.
“It can’t fly any faster than an average Baron. And its fighting
abilities cannot compare with a Viscount mount.”</p>
<p>“I’ll take him.” Han Sen did not plan on letting the mount do
any fighting, so it’d be suitable for simple travel.</p>
<p>A damaged Jade Night Crane was not expensive, and it was just a
little more pricey than basic xenogeneic gene material. Yun Suyi
gave Han Sen a very good deal.</p>
<p>The Jade Night Crane was very tame, and Han Sen was quickly able
to learn how to command it. He could control it in flight
easily.</p>
<p>Because it had no legs, it always landed on its belly. And
because the wings were partially disabled, it never could fly
completely straight. Its speed left much to be desired, as
well.</p>
<p>Fortunately, Han Sen did not have high expectations. So, after
he made the purchase, he rode the crane back to his island.</p>
<p>Jade Night Crane was flying again, and it looked excited to be
doing so. It kept squawking, and with amusing dedication, it
diligently took Han Sen to his desired destination.</p>
<p>“Poor thing. It got hurt because of its master, and then it was
abandoned. And now he is okay and can obey commands. Many creatures
with high intelligence can’t do that.” Han Sen sighed.</p>
<p>Back on his island, Han Sen let the crane land. But before it
touched down, Han Sen jumped off.</p>
<p>The crane’s belly hit the ground as it frantically flapped its
wings. The creature had tried to keep itself level when it landed,
but the attempt didn’t go very well.</p>
<p>Han Sen gave it some food and let it stay on the stone. Then,
Han Sen returned to the house. Before he went to Xuanyuan Cave, he
wanted to come to grips with his powers. He took stock of his
possessions.</p>
<p>Earl class Spell geno armament. Duke beast soul rabbit shoes.
Earl beast soul Red Mist Mink Glove, and King weapon Ghost Teeth
Knife.</p>
<p>With Ghost Teeth Knife there, his Teeth Knife skills would still
be the best to use. Teeth Knife wouldn’t have any breakthroughs,
though, so he planned to focus on a different geno art.</p>
<p>Using the energy flow from the Jade Turtle Spell, the feelings
of Sky Palace, and some parts of Dollar, he planned to make up a
brand new geno art.</p>
<p>“My Dollar focuses on powers that suppress. Why don’t I just
modify Dollar and make it better? But I can only use Dollar, or a
geno art that looks like Dollar, when I’m in my Dollar identity.
Otherwise, people might take notice. So, if I can’t make something
too similar to Dollar, what kind of geno art should I make?” Han
Sen thought about it, and he soon came up with an idea.</p>
<p>Jade Turtle Spell focused on suppressing one’s speed. Once you
got hit with it, you could not fly. Han Sen wanted to use that
aspect as a focus for his new geno art creation. He wanted to merge
elements of Sky Palace and Dollar. As for modifying Dollar, that
was something he could do later.</p>
<p>Han Sen kept testing his ideas in the room and learned a lot.
Combining them wasn’t proving too difficult. He created his new
geno art through repeated testing.</p>
<p>After pulling an all-nighter, he formulated a prototype of his
new geno art. It was something he had no difficulty casting. All he
had to do was improve the minor details of its design.</p>
<p>“Let’s call this geno art Turtle,” Han Sen decided.</p>
<p>Because he could not find a target to use it on, Han Sen didn’t
know exactly how effective Turtle would be.</p>
<p>Han Sen took a break to rest, and when it was daytime, he walked
out the door. The legless crane was resting beneath a tree. Han Sen
fed it again, then rode it to where he was supposed to meet with
Thousand Feather Crane.</p>
<p>Outside of Xuanyuan Cave, Han Sen saw Thousand Feather Crane,
First Day, and the Yun sisters.</p>
<p>Yun Sushang immediately apologized for her sister’s presence.
“Suyi wants to follow us in our exploration. I will be in charge of
her safety, so if something happens, do not worry. Do whatever you
need to.”</p>
<p>Since she had said that, no one objected. They left their mounts
outside and headed into Xuanyuan Cave.</p>
<p>Xuanyuan Island looked like a small volcano. The volcano’s
entrance led them into a gigantic volcano cave world. The cave led
off in a number of different directions, and there were swathes of
xenogeneics inside.</p>
<p>Xuanyuan Cave xenogeneics were very special. The most special
ones among them were called Xuan Jade Spirits. Xuan Jade Spirits
could travel through walls and appear in any comer they chose. They
were difficult to avoid.</p>
<p>So, once people entered the cave system, they had to be careful.
They could be attacked by Xuan Jade Spirits at any time.</p>
<p>At any moment, a mouth or claw could come shooting out of the
rock.</p>
<p>“Brother Han, this is your first time in Xuanyuan Cave. Be
careful. Xuan Jade Spirits can appear without any warning.</p>
<p>We might not be able to help you in time, if they get you,” Yun
Sushang said.</p>
<p>Han Sen nodded, and he opened his Dongxuan Aura. He kept
everything envisioned in his head. Any movement within a radius of
ten meters would not escape his notice.</p>
<p>They walked a mile into the caves without spotting a single
xenogeneic, but Han Sen did not let his guard down. He kept the
Dongxuan Aura running the entire time.</p>
<p>Suddenly, though, Han Sen saw a black jade hand come out from
the ground. It tried to grab Yun Suyi by her legs. The Xuan Jade
Spirit’s nails were black like daggers. If it got hold of Yun Suyi,
it could rip her legs off without much trouble.</p>
<p>Because they hadn’t met Xuan Jade Spirits for a long time, Yun
Suyi had dropped her guard. She was only a Viscount, as well. She
was not strong enough to react with the immediacy required.</p>
<p>Han Sen summoned Spell in front of him and fired her guns. After
the popping noise of gunfire, two of the Xuan Jade’s claws were
broken by the bullets.</p>
<p>Where the bullets hit, symbols were left behind.</p>
<p>The Xuan Jade jerked its injured hands away and retreated into
the stone. It left no sign of its passing. The surface of the stone
was perfect, as if the creature had never been there in the first
place.</p>
<p>Han Sen noticed he was able to feel where the Xuan Jade hands
would come from. There was thick stone and rock all about, but he
felt as if he received a signal from beyond it. Han Sen could feel
exactly where they were.</p>
<p>“Is this a power that Spell possesses?” Han Sen was shocked.
When Spell hit something, it was like she was placing a tracker.
The tracker didn’t deal damage, but it was very useful.</p>
