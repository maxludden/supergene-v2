<p>“Destiny breaks… Blood-Pulse spills… The alpha king’s prophecy has come true…” The priest looked very excited. He let the blood merrily fall on him as he kowtowed before Qin Jing Zhen. “My King, the alpha king’s prophecy appeared. This is a good sign for the prosperity of the Qin Kingdom. Please use the special method for performing a blood sacrifice.”</p>

<p>Qin Jing Zhen looked conflicted. He stared at the blood pool of the Destiny Well without saying a word.</p>

<p>Kings always thought more than the average person. Although this was a prophecy spoken of by the alpha king, Qin Jing Zhen could not be entirely sure this was it. “Will the prophecy happen just like it was recorded? Is this just a pre-established trick?”</p>

<p>As a king and a father, he had to be careful. After all, this all had to do with an alpha king he had never met.</p>

<p>If the prophecy was the truth, it was a lucrative prospect for Qin Jing Zhen to consider.</p>

<p>The prophecy predicted a king that would rule for one thousand years. Upon thinking about that, Qin Jing Zhen felt the blood in his body boil.</p>

<p>“Conquer the universe and become a king for a thousand years… Can I do that?” Qin Jing Zhen clenched his fists. He stared at the Destiny Well, which was spewing blood. His face looked strangely red.</p>

<p>Qin Jing Zhen had always been a smart king. His heart also held great aspirations. If he was able to rule the universe like the prophecy claimed, to him, that was all he wanted.</p>

<p>As a king, Qin Jing Zhen knew he should not do things he was not 100% certain of.</p>

<p>While he was deep in thought, the priest that had been sprayed by the blood started madly shouting. Their bodies glowed with a god light. It was as if they contained a strong power.</p>

<p>“My King, the water of destiny is reinforcing my body!” the priest happily shouted. “I feel as if even if I did not use a gene race and a God Spirit Blood-Pulse power, I could beat many elites!”</p>

<p>Qin Jing Zhen and Qin Bai fell back. Some servants generated power to make a shield of light that would protect them from the blood water.</p>

<p>Upon hearing the priest’s words, Qin Jing Zhen was awfully tempted. He saw the bodies of the main priest and other priests grow stronger. He said to himself, “If this entire prophecy is true, the thing inside Destiny Well can make people holy.” “My King, let’s start the blood sacrifice,” the priest begged. “For this to happen is a rare opportunity.”</p>

<p>If this was like the prophecy said, then the Blood-Pulse spring was just a herald. The treasure inside the Destiny Well required a blood sacrifice to be retrieved. Qin Jing Zhen’s face kept changing. He was a king, but sometimes even he was indecisive.</p>

<p>As a king, it was not wise to take a risk like this. If he missed this opportunity, he might miss the only chance he had to unite the entire universe. Qin Jing Zhen did not want to miss this opportunity, ergo, he did not know what to do.</p>

<p>Seeing Destiny Well’s blood spring become smaller and almost disappear, the priest again pleaded with him. “My King, please do not skip out on this opportunity.” Qin Jing Zhen had yet to make a choice. He gnashed his teeth and bowed to the wall behind the Destiny Well. “What should I do? Please, show me the way.”</p>

<p>Han Sen was shocked. He did not see anyone there.</p>

<p>He looked at the wall. Before this, Han Sen had only been looking at the well. He had not noticed there was something on the wall. When he looked at the wall, he saw a giant painting. There was a blossoming plum tree depicted in the painting. The flowers were opening, and the petals were falling. Underneath the boughs of the plum tree, deer were munching on the petals. Next to the plum tree was an old man in a white robe, who was sitting on the tree roots. The old man had a white beard and white, which complemented his white robe. He was holding a black wooden cane with a top that looked like a wine bottle.</p>

<p>Qin Jing Zhen was consulting with the old man in the painting for guidance on how to proceed.</p>

<p>“I am only in charge of guarding here,” the old man in the painting said in response. “I do not care about anything else. It is up to you if you want to take this chance,” It was like he was a living person.</p>

<p>“If there is any danger, can you please protect me and Bai, my son?” Qin Jing Zhen asked. “I have been in this painting for so long, guarding this place for billions of years. I have watched the rise and fall of the Qin Kingdom with many outsiders and elites reaching this place, yet the god temple was never destroyed.” The old man in the painting, who was sitting near the plum tree, spoke quietly. Even though his voice was quiet, his words were overbearing.</p>

<p>“With you speaking, I will not be afraid.” Qin Jing Zhen’s eyes looked bright as his face turned red.</p>

<p>To be able to rule the universe during his lifetime and become a king for a thousand years was all Qin Jing Zhen wanted.</p>

<p>In his lifetime, he could not see another hope of uniting the universe. Thus, he had to let go and see if there was hope.</p>

<p>Of course, the most important thing about all this was that the old man in the painting was protecting him. That was how Qin Jing Zhen had the courage to try. The old man in the painting had protected the Qin Kingdom for many generations. He had saved the Qin Kingdom from being destroyed through the many crises it had endured. He was the biggest beacon of guidance for the Qin Kingdom. If the old man in the painting wanted the Qin Kingdom to die, then the Qin Kingdom would have died many times over by now. All the kings took their gods seriously. They were even more important than the Qin family getting God Spirit Blood-Pulses. If a guy like that said he would protect them, despite the danger, it would not lead to a catastrophe. “Priest, get ready for the blood sacrifice.” Qin Jing Zhen’s eyes looked bright as he made the command.</p>

<p>The priest was very happy. He kneeled in the blood water and said, “Yes, I will prepare.”</p>

<p>The priests prepared the blood sacrifice. Han Sen stood next to Qin Bai. They kept looking at the Destiny Well and blood water on the floor.</p>

<p>Han Sen could not tell how the blood water had changed the bodies of the priests, but he did not feel safe about the situation.</p>

<p>Han Sen thought, “Qin Xiu was able to do anything for what he wanted. If he tried to trick his people, I would not be surprised.”</p>

<p>Now, he was just posing as Qin Bai’s servant, so he could not speak. Even if he used his identity to advise Qin Jing Zhen not to do it, Qin Jing Zhen would have likely ignored him and had him kicked out.</p>

<p>First, this was the Qin family’s business. Second, Han Sen could not determine the exact nature of the problem he was feeling. If the Qin family’s alpha was not good, it would harm them. Thus, Qin Jing Zhen would not want to do a blood sacrifice. First and foremost, Qin Jing Zhen would probably find people to kill him. The old man in the painting had a mysterious power. Not even Han Sen knew how strong he was. He did not know who he was either. Han Sen had no confidence in beating him in a universe in which he was suppressed. The Qin Kingdom also had many elites, and many of them had God Spirit gene races. The priest preparing the blood sacrifice was not a normal character either. He had to be a God Spirt Blood-Pulse inheritor.</p>

<p>Han Sen thought the blood sacrifice required the Qin family’s Blood-Pulse blood. He soon discovered it was not like that. The priest brought in a girl. The girl was about 13 or 14 years old. She looked terrified. She was obviously not from the Qin family.</p>
