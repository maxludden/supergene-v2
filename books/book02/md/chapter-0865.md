  Silver-Blood Macaque: Shapeshifting Beast Soul

Han Sen had finally received a new shapeshifting beast soul. With these buffs, Han Sen could definitely go up against super creatures, and perhaps things that were even stronger.

Although he couldn't allow Moment Queen to help him out anymore, fearing she might try something else or even self-destruct, the Silver-Blood Macaque would make up for her absence in battle.

Death Knell and Spirit Owl had also finished evolving by now, becoming super pets that could fight. His team would be stronger than ever.

Han Sen now had Little Angel, Death Knell, Spirit Owl, Little Silver, Little Fairy, and Wang Yuhang. With such a team, Han Sen believed it was possible to take down Devil-Blood Shelter.

Big Black, Small Black, and Little White stayed behind to defend Moment Shelter while they were gone.

Without delay, Han Sen brought Wang Yuhang right to the front gate of Devil-Blood Shelter. On this day, they weren't going to spend time trying to lure some of the residents away.

Spirit Owl flew high in the air and summoned an army of rats to assault the shelter. Each rat was sacred-blood in strength, and they ran in like a vermintide for boorish reconnaissance.

And just as Han Sen had deduced, the Devil-Blood King only had six super creatures left in his company. Han Sen and Wang Yuhang entered the shelter with the goal of killing the super creatures, first and foremost. They weren't going to take out the spirit and his spirit stone just yet.

The silver fox and Little Fairy were loosed, while Spirit Owl and Little Angel each picked themselves a target.

Han Sen caught sight of a wolf-like super creature. Han Sen's eyes gleamed with silver, and when they did, Han Sen transformed into a three-meter-tall silver ape. Holding his Flaming Rex Spike, Han Sen spared no time in swinging it down on the wolf's head.

Boom!

The super creature collapsed on the ground after Han Sen's attack. In one swing, its head had been smashed in. The skull had been skinned and half-shattered, exposing a bleeding brain on the inside.

The increase in power Han Sen had received was incredible to behold, and the thrill of unleashing it almost made him scream to the sky in delight. He picked up the Flaming Rex Spike in one hand, and the fallen super creature in the other. He tossed the super creature into the air and, while it was airborne, used his rex spike to beat it repeatedly. The wolf had no chance to fight back against such brutality.

Another super creature then went to fight Han Sen. In response to this, Han Sen pointed his finger and summoned Death Knell. The blue bell became a big bell, and with its bottom like a hungry maw, it set itself down upon the incoming creature. The super creature was then trapped beneath the bell like a spider in a glass.

From inside the bell, the clapper went wild. Amidst the tolls and scraping of nails against its hard interior, the super creature was going mad in its bid to escape. Alas, there was nothing it could do.

Han Sen was no longer affected by the noise, but it did disturb the wolf creature. Grabbing the lifeless body of the wolf by its wretched wounds, he pulled the wolf apart with his massive simian arms.

The Devil-Blood King suddenly popped up from Han Sen's shadow. He tried to strike at Han Sen's back with his claw-like fingernails, but Han Sen was ready. He fought back with Sonic-Thunder Punch, and when his fist collided with the Devil-Blood King, the silver sunlight went supernova. The strike against the Devil-Blood King's talons was tremendous, and it sent the spirit spiralling backwards.

Han Sen was overjoyed at this result, and without reprieve, moved in to perform the same skill again. And then he did it again and again and again without pause. The shelter was washed with a blinding white light from the repeated explosions of Han Sen's silver suns. The shadows all around were either dispersed or made faint, prohibiting the Devil-Blood King from melding into them to travel and escape.

With the vitality boost given to him by the Silver-Blood Macaque, Sonic-Thunder Punch no longer drained his energy as it used to. Without getting weak, he could continue swinging his fist as a Sonic-Thunder Punch without delay, over and over like any average punch. The Devil-Blood King could do little but try to fall back, as lightning crackled and sparked all across him.

Boom!

Han Sen punched his face, and when he did, the Devil-Blood King was thrown into the air. Then he punched his belly, and the Devil-Blood King was sent flying away a few hundred meters, striking the gate wall and making it crumble.

Blood spilled from the Devil-Blood King, and he turned black as charcoal with the lasting electricity.

Ignoring him for now, Han Sen turned his attention elsewhere. He saw the silver fox in a fight of its own, and it had managed to paralyze its opponent. Running over there to help out, he brought down a Sonic-Thunder Punch on the stunned creature's head.

Silver sunlight blasted out of every orifice of the super creature, and a little later, its belly exploded from the heat. Lightning and blood were everywhere, and a second later, it was pronounced dead.

Han Sen felt pretty awesome at this point. The raging silver ape body he now possessed moved fast, and he had managed to effortlessly beat back the Devil-Blood King and slay super creatures.

Han Sen hadn't had a good, easy fight like this in a while. Wang Yuhang, on the other hand, wasn't sure how to compose his thoughts. He was frozen by what he saw. When they first came to this place, Han Sen valued his help and needed it a good deal, especially with pulling creatures away. But now, in a short amount of time, Han Sen had reached a point where he was the one chasing the super creatures.

"This is sickening," Wang Yuhang thought to himself, unable to believe there was nothing he could do to help right now.

The six super creatures were soon killed. Two of them were second-generations, but none of them provided beast souls. That might have been a consequence of Wang Yuhang's presence, however.

The Devil-Blood King screamed as he suffered one last hack from Little Angel's greatsword. When she brought down her sword that one last time, it hewed the head off Devil-Blood King's shoulders and sent him back to his spirit stone.

"Go and look for the Spirit Hall," Han Sen told the Spirit Owl.

Spirit Owl made a noise not unlike a baby. And from below the Spirit Owl, a legion of rats followed and spread out like a tide in search of the hall. Within ten minutes, they had found it.

It was through a small hole, hidden inside a palace. When Han Sen reached the hall, he saw something strange on the spirit stone. He promptly bent to pick it up.

The spirit stone shone black and red, and then blew up in Han Sen's hand into nothing but dust.

"I failed." Han Sen had a wry smile, for this was the first time he ever failed capturing a spirit.

Still, he was now in possession of Devil-Blood Shelter. It was a decent reward, and when factoring in the two second-generation Life Geno Essences he had also obtained, he felt satisfied.

The two essences gave him fourteen super geno points, bringing his total up to ninety-two. He was only one step away from maxing it out.

Han Sen gave a thunder-element Life Geno Essence to the silver fox, and it was happy. The same could not be said for the fairy, however. There were no water-element Life Geno Essences to be obtained, and she was a little grumpy in her disappointment.
