<p>A coin soared through space. It dinged when hit the geno tablet.
It was like it had been drawn to the big block like a magnet. It
stuck to the surface of the geno tablet.</p>
<p>The geno tablet had been like a full-on generator seconds
before. Now, it was as if it had stopped. The reversal of the
universe suddenly came to an end.</p>
<p>The two universes were dead silent. The whole world was covered
in purple light. Countless creatures had a purple light surrounding
them, but they did not keep on reversing as they did before.</p>
<p>All of the creatures were shocked as they looked at Dollar. They
did not quite know what was going on. They did, however, muster a
glimmer of hope, even if they were afraid that renewed hope might
buckle and break any second.</p>
<p>Da-da! Da-da!</p>
<p>In the silent universe, footsteps rang out obscenely loud.
Everyone turned their heads in the direction of those footsteps to
look.</p>
<p>Qin Xiu had been softly staring at Wan’er the whole time. Now,
he was willing to move his vision away from the slumbering Wan’er
and peer into the purple light.</p>
<p>A shadow emerged from the purple light and came close to the
geno tablet. The shadow became clearer as time went by. When the
figure reached the geno tablet, everyone was able to discern his
face.</p>
<p>“Han Sen… San Mu… Dollar… Wealth God…” Suddenly, many people
were screaming aloud these names throughout the universe. The names
were all different, but they were all spoken in shock and exuberant
glee.</p>
<p>Chaos was holding Bao’er while this happened, anticipating the
end of all. She opened her eyes wide and looked at Han Sen with
sheer disbelief.</p>
<p>“I knew Daddy would come…” Because her universe powers had been
taken, Bao’er was like a baby again. Her small face was very
happy.</p>
<p>Han Sen looked at Qin Xiu, and Qin Xiu looked at him. Han Sen
quietly said, “Qin Xiu, give it</p>
<p>up.”</p>
<p>“Are you going to be the hero of this tale and come here to
judge me for my sins?” Qin Xiu clutched Wan’er and looked at Han
Sen disdain.</p>
<p>“I have never claimed to be a hero, and I am not capable of
judging you,” Han Sen said. “If I were in your position, perhaps I
would have sought to do the same thing you are doing.” Qin Xiu’s
eyes lit up with surprise. “But you still stand in front of me
looking to fight me.” Han Sen looked into space. After looking at
Bao’er, Ji Yanran, Han Ling’er, Han Littleflower, and the others,
he looked sad. His expression quickly changed to one of certainty.
When he looked at Qin Xiu again, his face remained unchanging.</p>
<p>“That is because the people I care about are all against you,”
Han Sen said. “You will destroy the universe for Wan’er, so I will
protect this universe for the people I care about. It does not
matter. Making the distinction between what is righteous and what
is evil, right or wrong, is all down to luck. Between you and I,
only one of us can protect that which we want to.”</p>
<p>Qin Xiu laughed. “You are right. We are the same kind of people.
This fight cannot be avoided.”</p>
<p>“Unless you give up the idea of reversing time and space.” Han
Sen asked, “Would you?”</p>
<p>“I will not,” Qin Xiu replied. “Would you?”</p>
<p>“I will not either.” Han Sen’s answer came without a glimpse of
hesitation. “Very good.” Qin Xiu stood up. He put Wan’er down on
his seat softly. He kissed her on the forehead and said, “Wan’er,
wait here for me. Your big brother will save you from this
nightmare very soon.” When he turned around, he was like an angel
turning into a demon.</p>
<p>When Qin Xiu looked at Han Sen, his soft face was totally gone.
His eyes looked certain and impervious to change.</p>
<p>“Although I was controlled by Chaos’s will back then, most of
the time, I was sleeping. I could still feel your existence. It
was, however, a magical feeling. I did not know who you were until
the geno prototype armor’s shell completely melted and my own will
started to assert control. Then, every now and again, I was able to
feel you exist.”</p>
<p>Qin Xiu looked at Han Sen and went on to ramble, “To me, you are
the closest stranger. When I felt you for the very first time, it
was very weird.”</p>
<p>“What feelings were they?” Han Sen asked.</p>
<p>“You and I are too similar,” Qin Xiu coldly said. “If we weren’t
going to become friends, it was obvious we would become
enemies.”</p>
<p>“It looks like your predictions were fairly accurate, but I wish
you were not accurate,” Han Sen said with a sigh.</p>
<p>Qin Xiu looked at Han Sen and said, “You practiced with four
geno arts. One came from Sister Moon’s Cold Sutra. Blood-Pulse
Sutra came from Blood Legion. Dongxuan Sutra came from Xuan Men,
and The Story of Genes hailed from my own first life. If you have
practiced Cold Sutra to the max, and you have taken that step and
purified your genes, the small universe you will create must be
incredible. Blood-Pulse Sutra is not for fighting, but it can make
a small universe. It would be the best out of the four geno arts.
The Dongxuan Sutra is a strong geno art. Perhaps when that reaches
the max, it can renew the universe, but it will not be your small
universe alone.” After saying all of that, Qin Xiu stopped
talking</p>
<p>“You revealed the first three skills, so why don’t you reveal
The Story of Genes?” Han Sen asked.</p>
<p>“Because it is a skill that cannot be practiced. When I woke up
with my past memories, I debated whether or not to practice The
Story of Genes. Ultimately, I gave it up.” After pausing, Qin Xiu
looked at Han Sen and said, “In fact, what helped you to progress
with The Story of Genes was not Chaos. It was me.”</p>
<p>“It was you?” Han Sen looked at Qin Xiu in shock. He seemed to
be surprised by this answer.</p>
<p>Qin Xiu said, “Chaos wanted to help you. After all, she had
studied the Sky people. But it was a shame she was not the one who
created The Story of Genes. She did not understand The Story of
Genes much. If I did not do something when she did it secretly,
even with the geno prototype armor’s help, you would have been
unable to learn The Story of Genes.”</p>
<p>“Why did you decide to do that?” Han Sen asked.</p>
<p>“I wanted to know if The Story of Genes only led to a dead end
or not,” Qin Xiu said with a smile. “Now that you have seen what
you have, I know for certain it is not a dead end. You have walked
its path.” “I do not know if I have walked it or not, or if I am
even on its path at all,” Han Sen said.</p>
<p>“It is a shame that between you and I, only one of us can go
forward,” Qin Xiu said. A purple light started to rise.</p>
<p>The geno tablet’s words, which had been so dim, suddenly started
to shine brightly. The coin that was stuck on the geno tablet
bounced away and returned to Han Sen’s hand.</p>
<p>Time stopped reversing earlier, but now it was starting again.
It was stronger than before too. Time was soaring back. The whole
universe was going back. Countless creatures were fading away.</p>
<p>The spirits that went to the geno hall were going to the geno
tablet. The souls that were in the geno tablet did not reincarnate.
They were absorbed by the geno tablet.</p>
<p>“The whole universe has already combined. I am the universe. The
universe is me. If you seek to defeat me, you will have to destroy
the universe. If you cannot defeat me, the universe will restart
from the point when I was the happiest with Wan’er.” Qin Xiu’s
body’s purple light combined with the geno tablet and the universe.
He was like a sky god that could control the sky and the
ground.</p>
<p>Han Sen looked dim. He looked at the countless planets like they
were countless souls flying. Many planets faded away. Many planets
that did not exist or only existed in ancient times were now
appearing.</p>
<p>His fight against Qin Xiu was not just about one person against
another. It was not that simple. It was about fighting against the
universe.</p>
<p>Han Sen did not know if his decision was good or bad for the
universe, but he knew that if the universe did exist, Ji Yanran and
Bao’er would exist.</p>
<p>“Stop him!” The god temple fell. The geno hall fell.
Annihilation-class God Spirit bodies began to fade. A sky full of
God Spirits screamed together.</p>
<p>It was not just the God Spirits. The God Chaos Party, the
universe of kingdoms, 10,000 race genes, countless creatures, and
many more cried endlessly. They all screamed and cried. Countless
creatures cried and prayed for salvation.</p>
<p>The universe was covered by purple mist. Everything was breaking
to its relentless encroachment.</p>
<p>“Come! Let me see the powers of your little universe. I want to
see if you will be able to stop my will.” Qin Xiu was like a demon
god. His voice echoed through the universe.</p>
<p>“I cannot wake up my little universe.” Han Sen’s body was
covered by purple light, but his voice could be heard by
everyone.</p>
<p>“Has he not woken up a small universe?” Chaos’s face
changed.</p>
<p>Crape Myrtle looked bitter. “Was the evolution wall’s
suppression still not enough to wake up his body?”</p>
<p>“The universe is too big,” Han Sen said. “My heart is not big
enough. I cannot keep that much stuff inside. All I have are my
coins. Now, I will give them to you.” He raised his thumb and fired
a coin at Qin Xiu.</p>
<p>In the purple universe, that coin became a smart and outstanding
showcase. It went through the purple air and kept spinning toward
Qin Xiu with both sides flapping.</p>
<p>Qin Xiu’s eyes froze in place. The whole universe’s purple light
was going to the coin. It was trying to stop the coin’s
advance.</p>
<p>The coin was rapidly spinning, and it was not stopping. Its
front and back were showing, bouncing back the purple light. The
coin was like a gold bolt of lightning that was coursing through
space. It rushed before Qin Xiu without slowing down for a
second.</p>
<p>Qin Xiu frowned. He opened his hand and sought to grab the
coin.</p>
<p>Qin Xiu looked at the coin and asked, “Is that the power of The
Story of Genes? It is very unusual. My universe powers cannot
control it.”</p>
<p>The coin looked old. There was only the number one on its front.
It looked like it was only worth one dollar.</p>
<p>Qin Xiu wanted to flip the coin over and see what was on the
back, but he noticed the coin was stuck in his hand. He was unable
to turn it over.</p>
<p>Han Sen looked at Qin Xiu and said, “No. This is not The Story
of Genes’ power, but you can still say it is.”</p>
<p>“Are you saying that The Story of Genes is a part of you, but
this is not a part of The Story of Genes?” How smart was Qin Xiu?
He immediately understood Han Sen.</p>
<p>“Yes,” Han Sen said.</p>
<p>“That means by destroying it, you will be destroyed too. Isn’t
that right?” Qin Xiu looked weird. His eyes flickered. A purple
mist gathered along his body. It was like there was a demon
covering his body. Qin Xiu clenched his palm tight. A scary power
exploded in his fist. He was going to crush the coin into dust.</p>
<p>In the next second, Qin Xiu’s face changed. He started to look
glum. His fist was shaking. His fingers were moving. Some gold,
rainbow light came out from the gaps in his fingers.</p>
<p>His body’s purple light was going to the coin very quickly.</p>
<p>“This… What kind of power is this?” Qin Xiu’s face changed to
something ghastly. His whole body had been trapped by this coin. It
was getting sucked into the coin.</p>
<p>Qin Xiu used every power he could, but he could not stop his
body from getting sucked into the coin.</p>
<p>Qin Xiu held his arm. His hands were getting slowly sucked into
the coin. Han Sen said to him, “Although I did not wake up a small
universe, I can eat any universe I choose. That includes your small
universe. Maybe I am not a human anymore.”</p>
<p>“How is such a thing even possible?” Qin Xiu’s eyes trembled,
but only for just a moment. In the next moment, Qin Xiu’s other
hand acted like a knife to cut off the arm that had a hand holding
the coin.</p>
<p>“That is useless.” Han Sen shook his head.</p>
<p>Qin Xiu cut off his arm, but his arm was sucked into the coin.
Qin Xiu’s body was still unable to escape the suction of the coin.
He was still getting sucked in. His body was falling into the
coin.</p>
<p>No matter how much power he exploded with, he could not escape
or deny the coin’s force of suction. Suddenly, half of his body had
been sucked very close to the coin. “I did not expect this to
happen… I really did not expect this… The power of The Story of
Genes is so strong… If I had known this sooner… Why would I bother
getting the geno prototype armor… I did not expect this… I will
lose to my own geno art…” Qin Xiu laughed maniacally. His laugh was
a bit strange. It was a bit sad, but it was also a bit happy. One
could not describe what sort of smile he had.</p>
<p>“Yes, you have lost to yourself,” Han Sen said.</p>
<p>“No. I did not lose yet. Even if I die, if Wan’er can assert
happiness, then that is already enough.” Qin Xiu looked at the geno
tablet and Wan’er. He was happy and said, “Wan’er, goodbye. Even if
Big Brother is gone, you must continue to live happily.” “Oh no.”
Crape Myrtle’s face changed. He wanted to remind Han Sen about
something, but it was too late.</p>
<p>Seeing Qin Xiu’s mouth cough up some blood, a purple blood light
was spat at the geno tablet.</p>
<p>Almost at the same time, Qin Xiu’s body was sucked in the coin
completely. That coin showed its back now. There was a purple
shadow behind the coin. It was Qin Xiu’s face. Behind Qin Xiu was a
universe that looked like a star.</p>
<p>“God… One universe coin…”</p>
<p>There was a voice in Han Sen’s brain, but he did not bother
listening to it. The geno tablet absorbed the purple blood light
Qin Xiu spat out. It suddenly started to run madly. The universe’s
time and space collapsed. It was like it was the end of the
world.</p>
<p>“Oh no! The geno tablet is the controller of the universe. Qin
Xiu is dead, but he activated the geno tablet’s self-destruct
command, which was the last resort. The whole universe is going to
be buried alongside Qin Xiu.” Light Goddess’s face looked pale.</p>
<p>“No, Qin Xiu did not want the geno tablet to self-destruct,”
Crape Myrtle said. “He wanted to bring the universe back to
Wan’er’s time.”</p>
<p>Moment God gnashed her teeth and screamed, “Han Sen! Hurry up
and stop the geno tablet! It cannot be allowed to continue!” The
geno hall was breaking</p>
<p>“It is futile,” Crape Myrtle looked said. “Only Qin Xiu can
command the geno tablet. Qin Xiu is dead. No one can command the
geno tablet. If you want to destroy the geno tablet, it means you
destroy the universe. If you do not destroy it, with the geno
tablet controlling the universe now, it will take the universe back
to that time.”</p>
<p>“That means it is game over for everything now.” All of the God
Spirits were very sad.</p>
<p>The whole universe was full of apocalyptic cries. It did not
matter if the people were from the universe of kingdoms or the geno
universe, since several places were falling. Countless spirits
succumbed and died to the disaster. The spirits were like stars
rising above a sea. They all flew to the geno tablet.</p>
<p>“Han Sen, save Bao’er first!” Chaos could tell the universe’s
reversal could not be stopped. She wanted Han Sen to save Bao’er
first and foremost.</p>
<p>“I will save Bao’er, but that which I need to save is not just
Bao’er.” Han Sen reached out his hand and pulled a stone clock out
of his pocket. He knocked the stone clock’s surface and said, “By
Dollar’s name, a sky full of everything will listen to me. Make
everything go back to normal.”</p>
<p>Via Han Sen’s voice, the madly running geno tablet suddenly
stopped. In the next second, the geno tablet that was consuming
everything suddenly spit out the power it had just absorbed.</p>
<p>The universe that had been destroyed by the reversal started to
come alive again.</p>
<p>A sky full of everything and all creatures felt their powers
return. Space was becoming lively again. It was a very joyous
occasion. Everyone raised their heads to the sky and looked at the
shadow of the geno tablet. The shadow was burned into the deepest
part of their brains. They would never forget this.</p>
