      “What’s going on with Han Sen?” Qing Le asked Cheap Sheep, as he walked
      inside.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cheap Sheep looked at the spirit with disdain and answered, “His brain had
      problems. We chased him off, seeing there was no point keeping a simpleton
      around. Having an idiot running the place would be silly.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Yeah! Yeah! He became so dumb! He cannot even tell the difference between
      men and women now. No one would even accept him as a slave,” Green Cow
      added.
    </p>
    <p>“That makes sense. Do you know where he is right now?” Qing Le asked.</p>
    <p>
      “Who knows? I sometimes seem him skulking around the alleyways, munching
      on leftover food. He knows they’re just bones devoid of meat, but he still
      ravenously gnaws away at them.” Cheap Sheep was saying a lot.
    </p>
    <p>
      After Qing Le heard this, he didn’t want to know any more about Han Sen.
      “Who asserted leadership over the shelter, then?”
    </p>
    <p>
      Cheap Sheep and Green Cow played dumb, and just said, “You’re the boss
      now, eh?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Before I arrived, I mean. Who was the boss?” Qing Le stared at the two.
    </p>
    <p>
      “There was a female spirit leading us, called Moment. She left a few days
      ago, but she has yet to return. No one dared ask her where she was off
      to,” Cheap Sheep said.
    </p>
    <p>
      Qing Le asked a few questions regarding Moment, but Cheap Sheep and Green
      Cow kept saying they didn’t know.
    </p>
    <p>
      Qing Le was satisfied, regardless. Cheap Sheep and Green Cow were being
      polite, after all. He walked around Shadow Shelter for a bit and came to
      quite like the place, and after that, he went to wait inside the spirit
      hall. He asked for the two to gather everyone the next morning, so they
      could announce who their new leader was going to be.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cheap Sheep and Green Cow agreed to do this, but eventually, they sneaked
      off into a stone house together. Han Sen, Moment Queen, Bao’er, Little
      Silver, Red Pony, and Galaxy Beast were all there waiting.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Boss, we’ve calmed him down. What do we do now?” Cheap Sheep explained
      what had occurred to Han Sen.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Why don’t we kill him in his sleep?” Green Cow spoke with a hushed voice,
      one that harbored contempt.
    </p>
    <p>
      Han Sen shook his head and said, “Qing Le is from Outer Sky Shelter. We
      don’t have the strength to combat such a place, and killing Qing Le would
      only draw trouble from there. You guys continue the charade for a few more
      days while I figure something out.”
    </p>
    <p>
      Cheap Sheep and Green Cow patted their chests and said, “Don’t worry, we
      are loyal to you. Even if we stand next to Qing Le and look faithful, at
      heart, we are forever yours.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Good. For as long as I breathe, I’ll take care of each of you the best I
      can.” Han Sen’s voice turned cold, and he went on to say, “Go back for
      now. Do as he commands and keep up the act. We can’t afford him growing
      suspicious.”
    </p>
    <p>
      When Cheap Sheep and Green Cow left the house, they began speaking to each
      other.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Cheap Sheep, should we follow the old boss or the new boss?” Green Cow’s
      voice dipped even lower. She was close with the sheep, and she trusted his
      judgment.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cheap Sheep rolled his eyes and said, “We follow the strong one, of
      course!”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Does that mean the new boss? He is from Outer Sky Shelter, after all. He
      must be stronger than Han Sen.” Green Cow made her opinion clear.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cheap Sheep touched Green Cow’s leg and said with a smirk, “You don’t know
      anything. No matter how strong Qing Le is, he is still the slave of
      someone else. There is no use in following a slave. Do you really want to
      become the slave of a slave?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “I thought you said we should follow the strongest?” Green Cow asked for
      clarification.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cheap Sheep sighed and shook his head. “Are you stupid? Are you really not
      able to tell how powerful our boss is? If Qing Le did not already belong
      to Outer Sky Shelter, I guarantee the boss would have killed him by now.”
    </p>
    <p>“The boss is that strong?” Green Cow’s eyes opened wide.</p>
    <p>
      “That is why I called you stupid. For as long as the boss is around, the
      shelter will still belong to us. Of course, if you want to pledge a
      short-lived allegiance to Qing Le, go right ahead. But with your measly
      power, it won’t make a difference once the tables turn.”
    </p>
    <p>
      Green Cow said, “I suppose you are right. You and I lack power, and it was
      very courteous for the boss to let us run and manage the shelter.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Exactly. And the boss has not told us to be hostile. He’s kept things
      friendly and maintained the quo.”
    </p>
    <p>…</p>
    <p>
      Han Sen left the shelter. He was not afraid of his companions being rats.
      Qing Le was merely a royal class spirit with a gemstone geno core.
    </p>
    <p>
      He needed to avoid Outer Sky Shelter’s wrath, above all. If that wasn’t an
      issue, he would have killed the pompous spirit already. Qing Le obeyed
      others, so his spirit stone was inside his body. He couldn’t even revive.
    </p>
    <p>
      Han Sen was determined not to let him get away with this, but he wanted to
      go to the Underworld before he did anything and retrieve his maggots. If
      he pinned the death of Qing Le on those creatures, they wouldn’t think to
      put the blame on Han Sen.
    </p>
    <p>
      Han Sen walked a few miles, but after a while, something white approached
      him. It was a three-meter-tall white ape. Its muscles were like steel, and
      the only places not coated with its lustrous fur were its face, hands, and
      feet.
    </p>
    <p>
      The ape had already reduced its power, but with his Dongxuan Aura, Han Sen
      was able to tell the creature was extremely powerful and far better than
      the maggots he was setting out to retrieve.
    </p>
    <p>
      Han Sen did not want to fight, though. So, he planned to avoid it. But the
      ape already had Han Sen in its sights. It ran towards him like a train,
      sounding furious, and it bellowed, “Are you from Shadow Shelter?”
    </p>
    <p>
      Han Sen eyed the ape up and down and thought to himself, “He must be
      looking for trouble.”
    </p>
    <p>Han Sen quickly answered, “I was there, but I just got kicked out.”</p>
    <p>
      “Good. Take me there and I’ll kill the master. No one will kick you out
      after that,” the ape said coldly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Han Sen felt a chill run down his spine, as he was actually the shelter’s
      master.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Wait, the shelter is owned by Qing Le now,” Han Sen realized. “Do you
      have a grudge with the new master there?”
    </p>
    <p>“It goes far beyond a grudge!” the ape roared.</p>
