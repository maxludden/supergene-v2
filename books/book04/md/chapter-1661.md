After a few days, many creatures and spirits had come to harass the shelter. There hadn’t yet been any elites, though.

Still, with Ancient Sky Mirror there, Han Sen didn’t lose much. The place did not have the power of Moon Spring, but Ancient Sky Mirror had many super elites inside it. When the mirror started to lose energy, Han Sen could refine the souls inside for nourishment. As a result, there was no need for concern with the mirror’s energy.

Of the creatures that were killed, some were eaten and some were absorbed by the mirror. It wasn’t much energy, but it was better than nothing.

Han Sen kept on practicing with the Dongxuan Sutra. He needed his Bulwark Umbrella to become super, and when that was done, he could focus on leveling up to reach the Fifth Sanctuary.

The Fourth God’s Sanctuary could not help him much more, so Han Sen didn’t want to delay his ascension any longer than was necessary. He needed to go to the Fifth Sanctuary so he could get his geno armor. His position until then wouldn’t be ideal, as going up against god class sorts wouldn’t be easy.

A person came to Shadow Shelter, waving and shouting at Sheep who stood atop one of the towers. “Wait! I come in peace!”

Sheep saw the human below, and so he went to tell Han Sen.

Han Sen came out and learned it was God’s Retribution. A long time had passed since they had last seen each other, but the man hadn’t changed much.

“God’s Retribution, what are you doing at Shadow Shelter?” Han Sen stood atop the tower and spoke to the man below him. He didn’t invite him in.

“We are old friends. Are you going to treat me like this? Invite me in so we can have a cup of tea together,” God’s Retribution said with a smile.

“This is bad timing, unfortunately. I can’t invite you in. Say what you have come to say and then leave. Otherwise, the creatures out there might believe you’re one of us. And that won’t bode well for you,” Han Sen said.

“I am here to talk about the prospect of co-operation,” God’s Retribution said.

“Co-operation? In what way?” Han Sen looked surprised.

“How about finding someplace quiet we can discuss this?” God’s Retribution asked.

Han Sen asked someone to invite him in. With the power that God’s Retribution wielded, it’d probably easy for him to break Shadow Shelter’s defense, anyway. He was being polite by not immediately smashing his way in.

“So, what do you mean by co-operation?” Han Sen sat down and asked him in the hall.

God’s Retribution smiled and said, “I am here to talk about Blood Legion. If you are willing to help us, we are willing to help you with your… predicament.”

“What do you guys want?” Han Sen didn’t think God’s Retribution would help him out of the kindness of his heart. He was here for something.

“I love talking to people like you.” God’s Retribution looked right at him and continued by saying, “We want Snake Witch’s geno armor. If we get that armor, Blood Legion will help you through this.”

Han Sen looked confused, and he asked, “Snake Witch? Who is that? I’ve never heard of her.”

God’s Retribution frowned. “Do you have to do this? God’s Organization sent Snake Witch to steal your son, Littleflower. I don’t know if she’s dead or alive, but don’t tell me you didn’t do it.”

Now Han Sen realized who Snake Witch must have been, and he knew she must have been an elite who had geno armor.

“Bao’er did it. She killed an elite with geno armor? Is she really that strong?” Han Sen was surprised.

He thought Bao’er simply killed a high tier demigod. His little baby was scarier than he originally thought, and God’s Organization was stronger than he thought now, too. They had members with geno armor.

“If you give us the geno armor, Blood Legion will help you sort this problem out,” God’s Retribution said.

Han Sen looked at him with amusement and asked, “Aren’t you considered a traitor to Blood Legion? Since when have you begun representing them?”

“Blood Legion is different now. The leader has a few descendants, and I’m okay there with them.” God’s Retribution touched his nose. “Anyway, don’t change the subject! Just tell me if you want to co-operate on this.”

“I would like to co-operate with you guys, but I don’t have the geno armor.” Han Sen shrugged.

“You don’t? How? I thought you killed her.” God’s Retribution shifted his eyes across Han Sen.

“I’m not that powerful.” Han Sen smiled.

God’s Retribution looked at him with disdain and said, “Stop pretending in front of me! I know you already got armor from Tina, and you can already use it. Aside from you, who else might be able to kill Snake Witch?”

“Believe me or not, but I didn’t kill her. And I don’t have her armor.” Han Sen put out his hands.

God’s Retribution looked at Han Sen and said, “I can only suspect you don’t understand how serious these matters are. The people who want to get rid of you are not just the elites in the sanctuary. Both God’s Organization and the New Community want you gone, as well. Without our help, even if you survive what comes immediately next, Shadow Shelter and all your followers will die. Do you really think the mirror can stop the forces of all the Fourth God’s Sanctuary?”

“I really want to co-operate with you, but again, I don’t have the armor. If I did, I’d be giving it to you right now.” Han Sen looked sincere.

Han Sen wasn’t lying, though. He hadn’t seen Snake Witch, and Bao’er said she killed a person who wished to kill her. She said she broke the woman. It didn’t sound like a geno armor was left.

“You should still think about it. God’s Organization has decided to kill you. It does not matter even if you are related to Han Jinzhi; aside from Blood Legion, no one can help you.” God’s Retribution did not believe Han Sen.

Han Sen asked, “What grudge does God’s Organization have with me, anyway? Why do they want to get me? And why do they want my son? Do they just want to use him to threaten me?”

“You might be Han Jinzhi’s heir. And that is a sin. If they had been able to identify you and use you to draw Han Jinzhi out, you’d have been killed a long time ago.” God’s Retribution sighed. “They want Littleflower because he is special. He might be able to prove you are Han Jinzhi’s heir, even if you don’t look like you are. They can use him for confirmation.”

“Special? What is special about him?” Han Sen was shocked. “Did they find out that Littleflower is already stronger than most people?”
