<h2>Can’t Bully People</h2>
<h3>Chapter 1826</h3>

<p>Black Steel didn’t hesitate. He grabbed Han Sen’s hand and
lowered himself down.</p>
<p>Han Sen grabbed the nearest blade and let Black Steel dangle
slowly downwards.</p>
<p>Black Steel’s fingers were so close to the prize he wanted: the
horse knife. His forehead dripped with sweat, knowing that he was
making a risky move. If they did something to detonate the grave,
they would die right then and there.</p>
<p>Black Steel’s hands weren’t shaking, though. He got close to the
horse knife that was still half within the juice. And very
carefully, he drew the knife out.</p>
<p>He moved with precision, bringing the knife out slowly to avoid
creating waves. It took him an entire minute to remove it
fully.</p>
<p>Suddenly, a drop of sweat dripped off of Black Steel’s face. It
fell into the steel juice, and then, shaa! White smoke billowed
up.</p>
<p>The steel juice bubbled. The knives began to rattle and shake.
They were pointing at the pair, freezing them in place.</p>
<p>After a while, the knives and the steel juice settled down
again.</p>
<p>Black Steel put the knife away and nodded up at Han Sen.</p>
<p>Han Sen acknowledged Black Steel’s signal and then slowly pulled
him up. He brought him back to the wall of knives they had come
down from.</p>
<p>Black Steel was now carrying his new knife, which was slung
across his back. He signaled Han Sen, and then they climbed back
out of the volcano. They did so in tandem, as quietly as they
could.</p>
<p>When they both climbed out of the Knife Grave, Black Steel
looked relieved. His clothes were soaking wet. The stunt they had
performed was too dangerous, and he had very nearly been
killed.</p>
<p>Black Steel looked at Han Sen. He noticed Han Sen standing
comfortably beside him, as if he was entirely unshaken. Like he
wasn’t bothered by the risk they had just taken. His forehead was
dry and without sweat, like nothing at all had just happened.</p>
<p>“I don’t know if he is ignorant or arrogant,” Black Steel
thought to himself. Regardless, his view of Han Sen was starting to
change.</p>
<p>“You own half of this knife, so we should talk about how best we
split it.” When they were down off the mountain, Black Steel
pointed at the knife and said this.</p>
<p>“I don’t need it. Consider that my service fee, paid in full.
When I need to identify one for myself later, perhaps you can help
me with that” Han Sen smiled.</p>
<p>“Do you know what knife this is?” Black Steel asked.</p>
<p>Han Sen shook his head. “What is it?”</p>
<p>The weapon lacked an energy signature, and with Han Sen not
being an expert, he could not discern the level of the blade. “This
is an Earl weapon,” Black Steel said.</p>
<p>“An Earl? I thought it might be higher. I need one that is at
least a Duke. You can help me find one like that, okay? With a bit
of luck and a sprinkle of hope, it’ll be a King. It’d be even
better if it was deified.” Han Sen looked grossly dismayed, and he
didn’t seem to think much of an Earl knife.</p>
<p>Black Steel slung the knife back over his shoulder and just
ignored Han Sen. He found a place in the foothills to sit down,
where they could wait for the next round of rain.</p>
<p>It took a long time for it to come, but it looked set to begin
again soon. While they were talking, a loud noise sounded. The
Knife Grave erupted and a pillar was fired into the sky. Then, the
rain of knives began to fall.</p>
<p>Black Steel took out his horse knife and chucked a Baron class
knife to Han Sen. Han Sen’s Baron weapon swiftly rose to knock away
the knives that were falling from the sky.</p>
<p>That round was mainly about using ordinary weapons. So ordinary,
not even Baron weapons were necessary. They got through it with
ease.</p>
<p>“Why don’t we enter the Knife Grave again? Perhaps a high-tier
weapon might now be found,” Han Sen suggested.</p>
<p>Black Steel shook his head and said. “After the second wave,
many of the weapons on the walls are Baron. Their power will be
stronger. If you touch them, they’ll immediately start rioting.
Unless you can fly in and out, you won’t be able to get back down
there.”</p>
<p>Han Sen looked disappointed, and he gave up on the idea of
heading back.</p>
<p>Together, they both endured another two washes of knife rain.
After the fifth storm, Black Steel decided to head to the mountain
and take a look. He looked at the knives in the mountain, and then
returned.</p>
<p>“Little Black, does your family have a deified knife? Does
anyone have deified treasure in Narrow Moon?” Han Sen asked,
curious what the young man would answer.</p>
<p>Black Steel just ignored him. The best way to deal with Han Sen,
he had now figured, was keeping quiet.</p>
<p>After five waves of rain, it would still be difficult to find
another Earl weapon. If their luck wasn’t too poor, they could at
least find a Viscount weapon. Black Steel wanted to find a Viscount
weapon right now.</p>
<p>They walked around for a bit before stumbling across three
others who were also in the pursuit of another weapon. Those three
saw Han Sen and Black Steel, and decided to come over to greet
them.</p>
<p>“Black Steel, why are you with him?” A Rebate with gold ears
looked at Han Sen and then frowned at Black Steel.</p>
<p>“I stand with whoever I choose to,” Black Steel said coldly.</p>
<p>The woman looked a little p*ssed after the rebuttal, and a
Rebate man that was beside her said, “Black Steel, don’t be so
arrogant! You are only the son of Black-Moon King. If you are as
good as you pose yourself to be, how come Knife Queen did not
accept you as a student, instead of this useless outsider?”</p>
<p>A strange-looking outsider laughed and said, “He couldn’t become
Queen’s student, but he can be friends with the student himself!
Ha. Maybe when he gets close, he thinks Queen will soften, and then
accept him as the next student.”</p>
<p>Black Steel pulled out his knife and swung it with rage.</p>
<p>The outsider raised his knife and fought back. But he only had a
Baron weapon, and it was quickly shattered by the horse knife.</p>
<p>To the outsider’s shock, he was then cut in half. His blood
spread across the ground.</p>
<p>“That… is that an Earl’s weapon?” The man and woman trembled.
They looked right at Black Steel’s horse knife.</p>
<p>The man yelled at Black Steel and said, “Black Steel, are you
really killing people here! Do you think you can do anything you
please?”</p>
<p>“Whoever insults Queen will die,” Black Steel said icily, not
even looking at them.</p>
<p>The man and the woman were still reeling from shock. It was
supposed to only have been a bit of chit-chat. If this event went
public, it’d be a death wish. But if people knew it was the
outsider who had insulted Queen, they would think Black Steel had
performed a good kill.</p>
<p>“Huh.” The man hummed and did not say anything. He looked at Han
Sen and said, “The student that Queen accepted must be decent. I
want to learn from you.”</p>
<p>The man no longer dared to provoke Black Steel, who had an Earl
weapon. So, he was going to take out his angst on Han Sen.</p>
<p>“You own half of this knife,” Black Steel said, before tossing
the horse knife to Han Sen.</p>
<p>The man was angered by this, and he said, “Black Steel!
You…”</p>
<p>Han Sen threw the knife back to Black Steel and smiled. “I am
Knife Queen’s student. Using this would be bullying, so instead,
I’ll use this.”</p>
<p>After that, Han Sen picked up a random knife off the ground. It
was ordinary, and didn’t even have a rank.</p>
