<h2>Kingese Sprint</h2>
<h3>Chapter 2381</h3>

<p>All the royal children made their ascent at a speed that was
neither slow nor fast. The crown prince Bai Weijie was leading the
way, but their formation began to change once they reached the
halfway point.</p>
<p>At the middle point of the mountain’s staircase, there was a
stone tablet. Upon it was inscribed, “Travel half the mountain,
thinking like a sword.” Han Sen didn’t know what it meant, but once
they passed by the tablet, everyone started to speed up. Prince
Four and Princess Two went past the crown prince Bai Weijie. Other
royal children started to pull away, as well. The group began to
spread out into ragged clumps of hikers, so it wasn’t as tidy as it
had been before the halfway point.</p>
<p>The King’s Kingdom nobles that had been watching half-heartedly
now looked wide awake. They paid attention to the two deified royal
children, of course, but many of them were just as focused on Han
Sen.</p>
<p>After all, Han Sen had sounded very cocky in the opening
ceremony the day before. If he didn’t perform well now, it would
become an embarrassing joke.</p>
<p>“Brother Sixteen, let us see who can reach the top of the
mountain faster.” Bai Qing Xia moved his feet faster and ran up the
mountain like a sharp sword.</p>
<p>Han Sen agreed to the competition, and he walked a bit faster,
as well. Heavy resistance pushed against him.</p>
<p>Han Sen still didn’t understand, though. Earlier, they had all
been hiking easily up the mountain. Why were they now forcing
themselves to exhaust so much energy to go faster? They hadn’t
reached the hardest section of the path, which meant they couldn’t
be performing at their best.</p>
<p>Regardless of how ridiculous it might seem, since everyone else
was speeding up, Han Sen couldn’t allow himself to be left behind.
He had to take this chance. Otherwise, the boasting he had done
during the opening ceremony would be for nothing.</p>
<p>Han Sen cast his water area power, trying to break the
resistance coming against him and make it easier to move forward.
But the further he went, the more resistance piled on. He had spent
a lot of energy already, and he couldn’t really accelerate beyond
his current speed.</p>
<p>If this continued, he wouldn’t be able to catch up with Prince
Four and Princess Two up ahead. He might even be left behind by the
other half-deified royal children.</p>
<p>Judging from the powers they used, those half-deified royal
children were much stronger than second-tier Kings. Han Sen
couldn’t keep up with them using raw strength alone.</p>
<p>Han Sen thought for a moment and then released his King area. He
let the waterfall-like resistance land atop him. When that power
washed over him, the Kingese in his body flashed gold and surged
through Han Sen’s blood.</p>
<p>Under the buffs of the Kingese, Han Sen felt the resistance get
lighter. Although it was still there, it was substantially
decreased.</p>
<p>If that resistance had previously been like a large river, it
was now like a small stream. It ran no higher than Han Sen’s
ankles, and it was only a trifling problem.</p>
<p>Han Sen didn’t say anything, though. Calling on the power of the
gold Kingese inside him, he rushed forward against the competition.
All of a sudden, he was leaving Bai Qing Xia in the dust.</p>
<p>The princes and princesses ahead were working so hard, but they
were suddenly distracted by a stampede of frantic footsteps coming
up behind them. The sound was so startling that they looked over
their shoulders for the source. There, they saw Han Sen glowing
with gold light, rushing madly forward. He blew right past them.
Comparing Han Sen to the rest of them was like comparing a sports
car to a lawnmower.</p>
<p>The royal children in the back stared at that rapidly
disappearing shadow in disbelief. They were frozen. They almost
forgot that they themselves had to keep moving.</p>
<p>No one had seen anyone run up the Rot Bone path like that
before. Even deified elites struggled against the resistance of
that trail. No one should have been able to reach max speed and
actually sprint up the mountain.</p>
<p>But Han Sen ran like he was uninhibited. His legs pounded like a
wild horse breaking free from his reins.</p>
<p>“Here! Here! Prince Sixteen is going to explode.”</p>
<p>“Holy shit! He’s so strong.”</p>
<p>“Is that the protection of all those Kingese? It looks like they
work against the powers of Rot Bone Mountain. The Rot Bone powers
can’t restrict him.”</p>
<p>“At that speed, if he can keep going… Maybe he really can
overtake the two deifieds ahead and claim first place…”</p>
<p>“Huh. He only got lucky. That isn’t his real power on display.
Even if he manages to run all the way to the top, he will only be
winning first place in this race. The exams have many more trials
and tasks for them. He can’t rely solely on luck. Plus, who knows
if he can even keep up this speed. The section of the trail above
the clouds is the most important part.”</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>Everyone could see Han Sen running forward. He skipped by many
royal children, and they looked excited.</p>
<p>When Han Sen caught up to Bai Ling Shuang, she looked shocked,
as well.</p>
<p>She knew the Kingese would reflect the power of Rot Bone
Mountain. Usually, people with the Kingese symbols Ao and Gu had an
easier time. For some reason, less resistance held them back.</p>
<p>But even the symbols Ao and Gu shouldn’t have been able to
obliterate the mountain’s restrictive power like Han Sen’s Kingese
symbols were. The symbols were only supposed to cause a minor
reduction in the resistance.</p>
<p>“It looks like more symbols than just Ao and Gu are useful in
the hike up Rot Bone Mountain. Other Kingese symbols have also been
activated, but I guess no one has had them before, so there was no
way we could have known,” Bai Ling Shuang thought to herself. She
now had a bit more confidence that she could take advantage of Han
Sen’s power to reach Rot Bone Mountain’s peak.</p>
<p>This might have been a favorable turn of events for Bai Ling
Shuang, but as she watched Han Sen’s sprinting shadow, she couldn’t
help but feel a bit jealous. “Why was he the one who received the
protection of thousands of Kingese? If I had gotten the protection
of a thousand Kingese, perhaps I would have ended up as our new
ruler.”</p>
<p>“He passed him… He passed him, too… He’s caught up with the
crown prince…” The audience was excited.</p>
<p>Han Sen’s body was gleaming with a golden light. He sprinted so
fast that he went right past the crown prince. He was quickly
gaining on Prince Four and Princess Two.</p>
<p>Prince Four and Princess Two felt the pressure coming from
behind them. They turned around to have a look, and there, they saw
Han Sen coming towards them. He was carried forward by a graceful
golden light. They frowned and accelerated as much as they
could.</p>
<p>Han Sen wanted to close the distance between them, but running
wasn’t as easy as it had been previously. Although he didn’t have
as much resistance to compete with, the force pressing against him
hadn’t vanished entirely. He still had to suffer some resistance,
and so he couldn’t go at max speed.</p>
<p>The onlookers were frozen. Three royal children were running
really fast towards the peak, and a big gap had appeared between
them and the others.</p>
<p>“Deified elites are so strong.” Han Sen couldn’t catch up with
Prince Four and Princess Two. The three of them entered the final
part of the trail, vanishing behind the cloud cover. No one would
be able to watch them anymore.</p>
<p>“Prince Four passed into the clouded trail first, so the deified
elites still have a strength advantage. The protection of a
thousand Kingese wasn’t enough.” Someone sighed.</p>
<p>“Who will be the winner?” King Bai, his queen, and the teacher
stared at Rot Bone Mountain’s peak with fervent interest.</p>
<p>Before, there was no excitement in waiting for someone to reach
the top. The deified children always won. But this time, Han Sen
was there, and that made the event interesting again.</p>
