<p>Han Sen’s fist punched the Dragon that was made of a draconic
presence, and it made him into something that was like paste. Han
Sen punched into the being, pulverizing all the fist came into
contact with.</p>
<p>Pang!</p>
<p>When Han Sen’s fist collided with Dragon Thirty-Nine’s fist,
Dragon Thirty-Nine’s face turned crooked.</p>
<p>His fist and arm was twisted, too. Dragon Thirty-Nine’s fist
came against Han Sen’s fist like a ball hitting a sheet of steel.
The finger bones cracked, making his facial expressions distort.
The whole arm was made to twist, shattering the armor as it all
occurred.</p>
<p>Han Sen’s fist was still advancing, as well. It was strong like
a piston-driven pillar, driving itself straight into Dragon
Thirty-Nine’s chest.</p>
<p>Dragon Thirty-Nine’s muscles were no match, and they immediately
buckled to the force and started to cave in. His body was quick to
look like a cooked shrimp. Dragon blood gushed as Han Sen’s foe
went flying backwards.</p>
<p>Pang!</p>
<p>Dragon Thirty-Nine’s body came back down, digging a long trench
through the earth. He eventually hit rocks. The velocity of skid
was so strong, he broke through the rocks, and it was only then
that he came to a stop.</p>
<p>Dragon Nineteen and Dragon Nine were both in shock. Their mouths
were open wide in what best amounted to a fine helping of
disbelief. All they could do was stare at the Dragon dust. They
could not believe their eyes.</p>
<p>With Dragon’s bodies being what they were, it was hard to
comprehend one could be defeated so easily by someone of the same
tier. That punch almost killed Dragon Thirty-Nine with ease.</p>
<p>It wasn’t just the Dragon that were in shock, either. All the
other Marquises that witnessed the fight were flabbergasted,
too.</p>
<p>That was because it was a Dragon. The world’s bravest sorts were
of the Dragon. One of them had been punched, soaring through the
air like a ragdoll. It was quite scary.</p>
<p>“Human… dollar… What is that race… Have you heard of them
before?”</p>
<p>“No… human… sounds so strange…”</p>
<p>“Scary… Even a Dragon’s body was punched that way…”</p>
<p>“The bodies of humans are scary.”</p>
<p>Many creatures began to ravenously discuss the event. Dragon
Thirty-Nine was soaked in his own blood, hopelessly trying to
scramble out from the rubble of the rocks. His chest was still
sunken and he could barely rise to his feet. Dragon blood kept
pouring out of his facial orifices.</p>
<p>“Roar!” Dragon Thirty-Nine roared. His body expanded, and his
Dragon wings possessed a frightening draconic aura. His body was
suddenly overtaken by what looked like real dragon scales. His
Dragon horns were shining more than ever. Overall, he was now
looking like a bonafide dragon, albeit in a humanoid form.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the arm that had been broken by Han Sen was
healed.</p>
<p>Dragon Thirty-Nine had become a xenogeneic. That was the form he
had activated. And with him now firing on all cylinders, he
approached his opponent. His body broke through space to teleport
directly before Han Sen. His scaled fists came forward in a punch
towards Han Sen’s chest.</p>
<p>The fist tore through the air and then exploded. To witness the
pressure, force, and power of that soaring punch, you’d be swift to
think that it could obliterate any mountain.</p>
<p>Another hand appeared then, though. It was one that was clad in
a golden armor. It appeared directly before that newly-scaled fist.
Those long, gold fingers grabbed Dragon Thirty-Nine’s incoming
fist.</p>
<p>That scary punch was brought to a complete standstill. All of
its power and desired impact vanished in less than a second. It
felt as if his punch had all just been pretend, and it was all an
illusion where no strength was actually used.</p>
<p>In everyone’s shocked eyes, the gold-armored hand moved. Dragon
Thirty-Nine was then picked up by it.</p>
<p>Boom! Boom! Boom! Boom!</p>
<p>The strong xenogeneic body of Dragon Thirty-Nine was reduced
into a mere punching bag. Han Sen grabbed it and kept swinging it
up and down to create two giant craters in the ground.</p>
<p>Dragon Thirty-Nine’s mutant Dragon body as totally broken. After
a few hits, the rigidity was lost and it became soft.</p>
<p>“Wa-la!” The noise of a paper being ripped sounded. Dragon
Thirty-Nine’s almost-obliterated body disappeared into thin
air.</p>
<p>“Too crazy. He can even kill a Dragon that brutally… how strong
is that guy’s body…”</p>
<p>“He is not of the same level, surely. Dragon Thirty-Nine was
quick to rip his paper, but I don’t blame him. A few more hits like
that and he was bound to blow up.”</p>
<p>“They were both Marquise, and that guy beat the Dragon. Why are
the bodies of humans so scary.”</p>
<p>“I wonder why I haven’t heard of this race before?”</p>
