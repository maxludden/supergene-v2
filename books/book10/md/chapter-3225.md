The Super God Spirit mode was invincible. It had never broken like this before. Although Han Sen was shocked, he had no choice but to keep ongoing

It felt like his body was being ripped apart. It was hard to accept. It would have made ordinary people feel as if they wanted to commit suicide.

Han Sen’s willpower was too strong. Even if his body was thrown into a vat of burning oil, he would not have wanted to die. His will to survive was very strong.

No matter how strong his will was, the pain was still excruciating to endure. Han Sen’s face was a twisted expression of that pain he was enduring through.

The pain he felt came from the main and reverse Dongxuan Sutra. He was able to control the other powers inside him. It was only this raging main and reverse Dongxuan Sutra power Han Sen was unable to control.

His other powers were affected by the restrictions imposed by the realm of Dusk Sky and were weak. Even his Super God Spirit mode had been weakened a lot.

When combined, the power of the main and reverse Dongxuan Sutra did not seem to be restrained by the Dusk Sky’s powers of restraint. It almost seemed as if they were becoming stronger. “It is just as I thought. The main and reverse Dongxuan Sutra can indeed restrain the powers of Dusk Sky. But this power is a little much. Even I am unable to fend it off. Even the Super God Spirit mode, which is Xenogeneic, is being broken by it.” Han Sen knew the only thing he could do was hold on and stay strong

The two reverse powers started to combine. If his body could completely combine two powers, it meant he would be able to live. If he was unable to hold it at bay, his body would be destroyed by the main and reverse versions of the Dongxuan Sutra power.

If this was an ordinary time, Han Sen would have managed to stay alive. Because of the Dusk Sky weakening his other powers, he was not sure if he could hold on until it was over.

Many cracks were forming on his burning white body. They made him look like a beautiful porcelain vase that had been shattered but taped back together. The cracks were very shocking.

The main and reverse versions of Dongxuan Sutra were coming to a very critical moment. They were quickly melting and becoming stronger. In a situation like this, the damage to one’s body was only going to become worse. Han Sen felt as if his body was no longer going to be able to endure things. The power the main and reverse Dongxuan Sutra created was far scarier than he believed it to be.

Han Sen gnashed his teeth to hold strong against it, but his body was like a porcelain statue that could break at any given second. He did not know when it was going to crack.

Bao’er’ saw the crisis Han Sen was in. She took out the little gold gourd and placed it atop Han Sen’s head.

The gourd’s gold light descended like a river of gold spring water to cleanse him. It moisturized his skin and made his bones, organs, and flesh better.

His body, which was going to explode, was improved by that power. Needless to say, Han Sen felt much better. His cells felt as if they had been glued back to a much better state and were all much tougher.

“Bao’er!” Han Sen was shocked and happy at the same time.

In the God Chaos Party headquarters, Qin Xiu sat atop Bury Path God’s throne. Bury Path God had his hands lowered. He emotionlessly looked like a statue.

Another God Chaos Party member looked at Qin Xiu strangely. While the God Chaos Party only obeyed elites, it did not mean any old creature could claim and sit upon the prior leader’s throne.

Any creature there was an elite in some capacity. They all had personalities. If it was about being more powerful than the other to get opponents to obey, it wasn’t so easy. But Qin Xiu’s power was so strong that it made them a little bit scared. Although they did not like it, no one dared say anything to object.

Qin Xiu had flipped his hands and suppressed Bury Path God. He had very simply forced Bury Path God to obey. Although they did not agree with this turn of events, they had no choice but to suck it up.

Qin Xiu looked down at the scary creatures and coldly said, “When I left the 33 skies, 11 skies were broken. It has been a billion years, and you guys have only made it to the 19th sky. At this rate, which year or month will we finally be able to breach the 33rd sky?”

“The 33 skies are not so easily broken,” a grumpy God Chaos Party elder said. “Every sky has a special function, and we will have different difficulties in each place. Every sky we break costs a lot of resources and power. You have no idea how much we have given up.”

Many scary creatures looked at Qin Xiu, wanting to see what he would do to that elder.

If he used force to join God Chaos Party, he would not let a person who had objected in such a way off the hook so easily. “Three years.” Surprisingly, Qin Xiu was no longer angry. He calmly spat out those two words.

“What does that mean?” the elder asked with his eyebrows raised.

“If I become the leader of the God Chaos Party, I will only need three years to break the 33 skies,” Qin Xiu coldly said.

“Do you really only need three years to break the remaining 14 skies left out of the 33 skies?” the elder asked with a curl of his lips. “I admit you have strong power, and you are almost as great as our leader, but you surely cannot believe the 33 skies will be broken through sheer force.”

“Force will not work, but I can do it,” Qin Xiu’s voice said quietly. He looked very confident. “If within three years I have failed to break through the 33 skies, I will return this leadership seat. Then, I, Qin Xiu, will never again set foot in any of the 33 skies.”

“Fine,” the elder said with a cold laugh. “This is your decision. We did not force you to do this. Just don’t break your own promise.”

“I, Qin Xiu, never break promises I have made,” Qin Xiu said. “If anyone tries to trouble me within these three years, no matter who they are in this party, I will destroy their bodies and temples.” He sounded vicious.

“We will wait three years,” a few elders said after looking at each other and nodding.

“Where is the warehouse of the party?” Qin Xiu asked after standing up. “Take me there.”

Bury Path God, who still looked devoid of emotion, said, “The information of this party is taken care of by Minister Five. I will ask Minister Five to take you to the warehouse.”

Minister Five hurried to lead Qin Xiu out of there. All the scary creatures rapidly spoke to Bury Path God. “Leader, are you really going to let Qin Xiu take over God Chaos Party?”

“With all of our power combined, we might stand a chance.”

Bury Path God shook his head coldly. “You guys do not need to rush this. Qin Xiu is strong, but he is only one human. He must have a flaw. We will do something when we find out what that flaw is.”

Bury Path God walked in front of a scary creature and passed him something. He used a tone of voice only Hate Ghost could hear and said, “Take this item to Dust Sky. You will have one hour of no pressure from Dust Sky. Kill Han Sen and do not be discovered.”

“Mister Leader, what is the point of us killing Han Sen now?” Hate Ghost asked.

“Just do as you are told,” Bury Path God said. He looked a bit weird. “I have my reasons.”
