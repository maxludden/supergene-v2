<p>Han Sen’s body moved. His movement was not visible, but he was
already coming before Qin Xiu. He grabbed Qin Xiu’s head and pushed
downward.</p>
<p>Pang!</p>
<p>Qin Xiu’s head was pushed onto the stone floor by Han Sen’s
hands. His head hit the geno hall, making the very heavy god stone
floor fracture. Qin Xiu’s whole head was inside the undying, hot
stones that were broken.</p>
<p>Qin Xiu’s eyes opened wide. His pupils looked as if they had
lost their focus. He looked to be in total disbelief. Wan’er, who
was in his hands, flew away and fell across the floor.</p>
<p>Han Sen’s hands were pressed upon Qin Xiu’s forehead, and he
continued to push him. Qin Xiu was unable to raise his head. His
body had bloody flames wildly dancing. His hands gripped the ground
to get up, but Han Sen was still pushing him. He was unable to get
up. His eyes looked to be in disbelief at what was happening. He
said to Han Sen, “Impossible… How can Wan’er not affect you?”</p>
<p>“You discovered The Story of Genes,” Han Sen coldly said.
“Didn’t you know that it has Forever Power? It cannot be affected
by any power.”</p>
<p>The Story of Genes power was waving through his cells. In the
past, Han Sen was unable to make The Story of Genes power be the
best it could be. After he understood what it meant to become
absolutely still, he understood what forever really meant. It was
enough to control the body for real. Not even Wan’er could affect
him now.</p>
<p>“No… Impossible… The Story of Genes cannot work. You must have
the super gene to practice The Story of Genes. If you have super
gene, then you do not have to practice The Story of Genes. This is
a cycle that cannot work. It is impossible for it to work…” After
Qin Xiu spoke, the bloody fire madly exploded. He was going to send
Han Sen flying.</p>
<p>He only managed to raise his head one inch before Han Sen’s hand
pressed him down again. He was squashed against the rocks deeper
than last time. His entire upper body was being pressed.</p>
<p>Scary, bloody fire whipped around Han Sen’s body, but it was
unable to bring him a speck of harm. The reversed blood power that
could downgrade a God Spirit did not affect Han Sen.</p>
<p>“Qin Xiu, it is time for you to pay the price.” Han Sen pressed
on Qin Xiu’s body. His eyes flickered with a strange light. Qin
Xiu’s bloody fires were raging. He was like a volcano erupting.
Although he could not get up, he laughed and said, “I did not
expect a geno art that could not be successful like The Story of
Genes was actually made successful by you. So what? Can you kill
me? If I die, Littleflower dies with me. You cannot kill me.”</p>
<p>“Really?” Han Sen’s face did not change. The light in his eyes
started to look weird.</p>
<p>The Dongxuan Sutra’s power was quietly floating through Han
Sen’s body. In Han Sen’s eyes, the whole universe was split. It
turned into the smallest substance that was completely
primitive.</p>
<p>Han Sen held Qin Xiu’s forehead. His transparent hands were like
nothing as they went straight into the helmet. It went through
Littleflower’s body.</p>
<p>A blood-red shadow was pushed out from Littleflower’s body by
Han Sen’s hands. He threw it on the floor.</p>
<p>Littleflower’s body flew away. The god stone floor was like a
spiderweb cracking in all directions. It created a giant stone
hole. A red shadow was in the center of hole. That red shadow’s
face was like Qin Xiu’s statue.</p>
<p>Littleflower’s body fell on the floor. He woke up. He coughed
and climbed up off the ground. He looked at Han Sen in shock.
“Father…”</p>
<p>Han Sen was holding Qin Xiu as he asked, “Are you OK?”</p>
<p>“I am fine,” Littleflower said with a shake of his head.</p>
<p>“I am glad you are OK,” Han Sen said as he stared at Qin Xiu.
“You should leave. Someone will collect you and take you to Space
Garden. I still need to deal with this guy.”</p>
<p>“Please be careful, Father.” Littleflower knew staying would
only hamper Han Sen. After saying that, he flew away from the geno
hall. Han Sen said, “Qin Xiu, you are right. We are the same. We
will do anything for something that we care about. Therefore, you
must die.” The power in his hands suddenly increased. Super Spank
power was going to turn Qin Xiu’s spirit body into dust.</p>
<p>Under the power of Super Spank, Qin Xiu’s red spirit body kept
turning into red dust as he faded. Qin Xiu’s was still smiling.
“Yes. We are the same. I understand you, and you understand me.”
After that, Qin Xiu’s eyes turned. He looked at Wan’er, who was
lying down nearby. “I, Qin Xiu, have never asked anybody anything,
but may I ask you one thing?”</p>
<p>“Speak,” Han Sen said. The power in his hands increased to crush
Qin Xiu’s body. His spirit body was rapidly breaking.</p>
<p>“If I win, you do not have to do it,” Qin Xiu said. “If I lose,
please could you take care of Wan’er? All this crime is my doing.
Wan’er should not suffer from my sins since she never did anything
wrong. She should not come to harm. Please take care of her.”</p>
<p>“As long as she does not hurt anybody, for as long as I live, I
will not allow any harm to come to her,” Han Sen said.</p>
<p>“Thank you very much.” Qin Xiu’s eyebrows raised. His body was
changing. He looked weird as he went on to say, “To me, this world
is like hell, but this is Wan’er’s world. She has family and
friends here. She does not want to see this world destroyed. I do
not want to watch her die.”</p>
<p>“I really can’t do it.” Qin Xiu closed his eyes. A weird sun
arose in his red spirit body.</p>
<p>Boom!</p>
<p>When the power in Qin Xiu’s body was released, the cracks
underneath his body spread. It created a giant space crack. This
space crack was different from ordinary space cracks. This space
crack had a grey presence. It was weird. It made Han Sen feel like
he was in danger.</p>
<p>In Qin Xiu’s presence, it was like a fish in water. The red fire
was becoming stronger.</p>
<p>Upon seeing this, God’s expression changed. He looked at Han Sen
and hurriedly said, “Hurry up and kill him. We cannot allow him to
open the path of reverse.”</p>
<p>Han Sen realized how bad this was. Even though scary space power
was consumed, the undying god stone melted like snow. In that
space, the scary presence grew stronger. It was like a demon
presence from a demon land.</p>
<p>Han Sen was familiar with this power. When he was fishing in
Outer Sky Lake, he had felt a similar presence. It was the presence
of the antimaterial world.</p>
<p>Qin Xiu suddenly let out a weird laugh. “Han Sen, come and enjoy
the view of hell together.”</p>
<p>Qin Xiu’s hands suddenly grabbed Han Sen and pulled him into the
space crack.</p>
