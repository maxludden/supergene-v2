<p>Western Gran City’s elites were all drawn to that bottomless
hole. Even xenogeneics were lured there. Han Sen and Mister Tiger
were starting to feel some relief. Mister Tiger had called Han Sen,
and although he did not dare say much, they chatted about
run-of-the-mill subjects. Mister Tiger did mention that their cover
story had not been exposed, though.</p>
<p>Han Sen had nothing to do for the time being, and when there was
no one around at night, he often found himself returning to the
sanctuary. There he had melted down the blue crystal tentacle and
cooked it</p>
<p>The tentacle was a few hundred kilograms heavy. If Han Sen was
to eat it alone, it’d take forever. So, he called over his family
to help him eat it</p>
<p>After Little Angel, Golden Growler, and Xie Qing King ate it,
they all had weird reactions to it. Their genes were slowly
starting to evolve.</p>
<p>Han Yufei had a slice and almost generated geno armor.
Fortunately, he was able to suppress it. Otherwise, he’d have been
forced out of the sanctuary.</p>
<p>“It looks like this is great for people who don’t have geno
armor. It seems like I will have to get more if I want Little Angel
to grow. In time, I’d like to bring them all to Planet Kate,” Han
Sen thought to himself.</p>
<p>Han Sen could take Han Yufei to Planet Kate to generate his geno
armor, and save him from the risk of the Big Silence system.</p>
<p>But when Han Sen mentioned this, Han Yufei said that he hadn’t
spent enough time with Luo Lan. Because of this, he did not want to
generate his geno armor yet. He only wanted to spend time with her,
and he cared little about gaining power now.</p>
<p>Han Sen ate some of the tentacle, but his xenogeneic gene tally
did not increase. He’d have to eat a whole lot of the stuff, just
to gain a small amount.</p>
<p>So, Han Sen decided that if he did ever get massive ingredients
like this again, he’d bring them back for his companions to eat. If
they grew up and became Nobles with him, that’d be pretty
great.</p>
<p>Han Sen saved some of the tentacle for Little Silver, who was
still in the Fourth God’s Sanctuary. After he ate some of it, he
almost went to the Alliance.</p>
<p>“This is pretty good. I wonder how I can get some more?” Han Sen
wondered.</p>
<p>Han Sen made a bone soup out of the gold bone. He earned one
Baron gene after drinking it.</p>
<p>During the day, Han Sen was on Planet Kate with little to do
except practice. While he was browsing the news one day, though,
his phone rang.</p>
<p>“Mister Tiger?” Han Sen was surprised. Mister Tiger had been
very cautious since that day, so Han Sen guessed that something
important must have happened for the man to contact him so soon.
“Han Sen? Yeah, the Third Master would like to see you. Do you have
the time to pay a visit?” Mister Tiger’s tone was complicated to
discern.</p>
<p>“Third Master? What Third Master?” Han Sen was confused.</p>
<p>“The Black Gold Group’s Chairman’s third son. Everyone just
refers to him as Third Master. He wants to extend an invitation for
you to join Black Gold Group.” Mister Tiger then took a long pause.
After, he said, “I think this is a good thing. Third Master must be
willing to pay you a lot, as he seems to think that you are of
great importance. I know you don’t really care about the money, but
with Black Gold Group backing you, I think things will be easier
for you.”</p>
<p>Mister Tiger tried to convince Han Sen to join because he knew
of Third Master’s temper. He wouldn’t relent until Han Sen joined
the company.</p>
<p>But Mister Tiger also knew that Han Sen was not someone to take
lightly. He had just witnessed Han Sen slay the Feathers, after
all. If Third Master pissed him off, who knew what sort of
Armageddon he’d bring? So, Mister Tiger was quite nervous just
asking him.</p>
<p>Han Sen could guess what Mister Tiger was really thinking. He
smiled and told him, “I am happy in Wizard. I don’t plan to switch
groups. Please tell Third Master that I am not against making new
friends, though.”</p>
<p>“Okay, I will go and tell him that.” Mister Tiger gave him a wry
smile. He didn’t think that would be enough to please Third
Master.</p>
<p>Mister Tiger was now nervously making his way to meet with Third
Master. Awkwardly, he told him what Han Sen had said.</p>
<p>Third Master wasn’t made mad. He smiled slightly and said, “If
he doesn’t want to join, I will not force him. It is good to make
friends, and I will meet him on the morrow.”</p>
<p>That was not the response that Mister Tiger had expected, and he
ha If-expected that the other shoe would soon drop. Still, it was a
good sign that Third Master did not lose his composure.</p>
<p>Han Sen also explained the matter to Qiao. She did not need to
worry about Han Sen potentially leaving her.</p>
<p>The next day, a very luxurious vehicle parked itself in front of
Qiao’s house. Han Sen got in and found a man sitting inside waiting
for him.</p>
<p>Third Master was a pure Kate, with black cat ears and a black
cat tail. Aside from that, though, he looked like a human. He was
dressed in a black suit, and he looked quite fancy.</p>
<p>“Make yourself comfortable, there is no need for you to be so
formal. If we’re going to be friends, you should treat me as one.”
Third Master laughed.</p>
<p>Mister Tiger, who was driving, was rather shocked by Third
Master’s attitude. Third Master didn’t behave like this with any
Noble.</p>
<p>“Thank you very much.” Han Sen settled into one of the
comfortable seats.</p>
<p>Third Master poured Han Sen some wine. Han Sen had a sip and
thought it tasted rather lovely.</p>
<p>“If we are friends, then I’ll cut the crap, too. I am here
hoping you can be my teacher,” Third Master said.</p>
<p>“Black Gold Group has a great deal of elites and Barons. I only
have geno armor, so surely, you must be joking,” Han Sen said.</p>
<p>Third Master looked upset and said, “Han Sen, I am treating you
like a friend. Please do not talk to me like that. I can tell the
power you hold. If you can teach me, I am willing to do whatever
you please.”</p>
<p>“What would you like to learn?” Han Sen asked quietly.</p>
<p>“Everything. I want to learn everything from you.” Third Master
was looking directly into Han Sen’s eyes.</p>
<p>“I need to work with Wizard, though. I do not have much free
time,” Han Sen said.</p>
<p>“That’s fine. Just tell me when you have time, and I will work
around your schedule. It would be best if you could join us,
though. If you did that, you wouldn’t have to do anything, and
you’d be showered with money,” Third Master said.</p>
<p>“I have no intention of leaving Wizard, but I do have some time.
I will set things up later.” Han Sen looked out the window,
frowned, and asked, “Where are we going?”</p>
<p>“The bottomless hole in the western side of the city.” Third
Master laughed.</p>
<p>“The Feathers said I cannot leave the city.” Han Sen shrugged
his shoulders.</p>
<p>“This still counts as part of the city. You aren’t leaving, and
even if you did leave, Xina couldn’t do anything with me here.”
Third Master looked confident in that.</p>
