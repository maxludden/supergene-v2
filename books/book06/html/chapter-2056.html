<h3>Chapter 2056</h3>

<p>Xius and the Dragon lady did not lower their voices, so Han Sen
could hear everything they said clearly.</p>
<p>“Trying to take me as a mount? How dare you! Even if I was
willing to, wouldn’t you need legs?” Han Sen wondered how he might
get out of this particular predicament.</p>
<p>The Dragon lady looked as if she was Marquise class. The rest of
the crew looked to be no less than Dukes. With a battleship at
their disposal, making an escape did not seem like a viable
option.</p>
<p>The main problem, however, was that if Han Sen exposed himself,
the entire Return Ruin Sea would be going after him. The exit would
be heavily guarded from that point on, and running would become
impossible.</p>
<p>“No, I can’t expose myself,” Han Sen kept thinking, as he tried
to finish off the rocky shark.</p>
<p>“Xenogeneic Marquise hunted. Rock Shark: xenogeneic gene found.
Obtained Rock Shark beast soul.”</p>
<p>Han Sen ripped apart the Rock Shark’s body and bit into a bone
that was the xenogeneic gene. He acted like nothing had happened
and started to casually swim off.</p>
<p>Xius wasn’t going to let Han Sen get away, though. She moved her
snake tail and blocked Han Sen’s passage with a holy light.</p>
<p>Han Sen moo’d at Xius to show that he was a cow. Xius smiled,
then waved her hand. A holy light halo then flew towards him.</p>
<p>Han Sen tried to chomp on the light with his teeth. He wanted to
see if he could break it without exposing himself. The ring hit his
head and then grew larger. It slipped over Han Sen’s head and
tightened around his neck.</p>
<p>The halo tightened around the Stone Cow’s neck, feeling as if it
was going to choke him.</p>
<p>Han Sen shook his head and tried to get rid of it, but that
light was so tough. Even with the Stone Cow’s powerful body, he
could not break it. It must have been a special geno art belonging
to the Gana.</p>
<p>As Han Sen wondered whether or not he should use his own powers
to break it, he heard a strange noise come from Xius.</p>
<p>Han Sen had never heard this before. It was not a specific
language, but he knew what it meant. It was a comforting tone,
compelling him to obey her. It also had an undercurrent of
threat.</p>
<p>It was complicated, but somehow, Han Sen was able to hear and
understand it.</p>
<p>“The geno arts of the Gana are creepy. It is a shame that
Purgatory Heaven is in Planet Eclipse. Otherwise, I could ask the
Guna sisters,” Han Sen thought. “Since I cannot run now, let’s
pretend that I have been captured. With Xius’ status, perhaps she
can take me out of Return Ruin Sea. Maybe then I can expose
myself.”</p>
<p>Xius kept making those sounds, and the halo continued to
tighten. He felt as if his neck would snap.</p>
<p>Han Sen could get rid of the halo, but instead, he just widened
his cow eyes and looked tamed. He moo’d to Xius and did not look
angry. He tried to seem as harmless as possible.</p>
<p>“Will you follow me?” Xius asked, seeing the Stone Cow behave
that way.</p>
<p>Moo! Han Sen pretended his best to be gentle. He walked up next
to her and rubbed against her body.</p>
<p>Han Sen kept rubbing against her, recalling the behavior of
Little Silver and Little Star. He thought about them for tips on
how a creature should behave if it wanted to be cute.</p>
<p>Xius was happy with Han Sen’s performance. She stroked the cow’s
head and smiled. “Follow me from now on, and you will benefit
greatly.”</p>
<p>Moo! The Stone Cow moo’d again, showing that it understood.</p>
<p>“Sister Xius is so powerful. I have learned a lot today,” Dragon
Nineteen complimented.</p>
<p>“It was just luck. This Stone Cow’s intelligence isn’t too bad,
and its personality is very gentle. That’s why this process was so
smooth,” Xius said.</p>
<p>The halo around Han Sen’s neck loosened. It was not gone, but it
was still hanging around him.</p>
<p>“This geno art is quite interesting. I would like to learn it.
It’d be far easier to catch xenogeneics with it,” Han Sen thought
to himself.</p>
<p>Xius brought Han Sen back aboard the battleship with her. Han
Sen pretended to follow her, and he did his best to behave
nicely.</p>
<p>Han Sen was very good at acting cute because many of his pets
were. All he had to do was copy some of their actions, and it made
Xius and the others so happy. They were all very fond of him.</p>
<p>“Sister Xius, this Stone Cow is too cute. If you don’t want it,
you can give it to me. I will trade it for a Duke golem mount,”
Dragon Nineteen said, holding the cow’s neck and stroking it.</p>
<p>Han Sen felt as if his head was resting on something very soft.
His eyes looked very innocent.</p>
<p>“Who are you kidding? It is just a Stone Cow, and it came from
your Return Ruin Sea. I’ll just grab another for you later. I don’t
know if I’ll have the chance to come back around these parts again,
though.” Xius smiled.</p>
<p>Dragon Nineteen, hearing her say this, did not push the subject.
She stroked the Stone Cow’s head again.</p>
<p>Sister Nineteen, are there any other places we have not been
to?” Xius changed the subject.</p>
<p>“I have searched thousands of miles, and I think Han Sen really
did escape Return Ruin Sea. If he hadn’t, I would have found him by
now,” Dragon Nineteen said.</p>
<p>Since they were talking about him, Han Sen sat right next to
Xius. He leaned against her, making sure he caught all they were
saying.</p>
<p>Xius frowned and said, “How did he get out of Return Ruin
Sea?”</p>
<p>“Maybe he has space powers or a treasure of some kind.
Otherwise, how could he have come here in the first place?” Dragon
Nineteen shrugged. “Han Sen is strong. He killed Sharon and Sister
Thirteen, and he managed to escape from Brother Fifteen and Long
Ying. I am afraid only our big brother might be able to take him
down.”</p>
<p>Xius frowned. “I have been investigating Han Sen a good deal. He
fought Lone Bamboo in Sky Palace to a stalemate. He is a genius.
Not many of the same level are capable of beating him.”</p>
<p>“Ha. He is just lucky he hasn’t encountered my big brother yet,”
Dragon Nineteen scoffed angrily.</p>
<p>“Dragon One is the best of the Dragon. He is the leader of the
Dragon, so of course he is very strong,” Xius said.</p>
<p>“But Han Sen is gone. If my brother had been here to fight him,
he’d have been killed.” Speaking of Dragon One, Dragon Nineteen
looked very enthused. She seemed to really admire him.</p>
<p>Xius and Dragon Nineteen did not plan on leaving Return Ruin Sea
just yet. They continued searching for a while with their
battleship.</p>
<p>Xius thought Han Sen was still around someplace. If it was
Dragon Nineteen in command, they’d have left a long time ago.</p>
