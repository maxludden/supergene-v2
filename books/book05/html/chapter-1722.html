<p>Han Sen recognized what he was seeing. Judging from its appearance, it was a Kate.</p>

<p>It looked like a human, but it had cat ears and a cat tail, too. That meant it was a Kate.</p>

<p>But it was different from the other Kate people that Han Sen had seen. It had no geno armor, and its nails were half a foot long. They were like swords, and they shone with a fluorescent blue color. The eyes of the creature were glowing red, as well.</p>

<p>The xenogeneic did not stop after rushing past Han Sen and Suo Tu, and it went straight for Long. Its hands, each bearing five dagger-like nails, flashed toward Long’s head.</p>

<p>It was too fast, and Long didn’t have time to dodge the strike. He shouted, lifted his shield, and blocked the attack.</p>

<p>Katcha!</p>

<p>The sharp nails obliterated the shield and pierced straight into his geno armor and skin, leaving him with five lacerations that bled profusely. Fortunately, the shield had absorbed most of the damage, and the hits he had taken were not half as bad as what they could have been.</p>

<p>Immediately after, the xenogeneic went right for another soldier. That soldier had been in too much shock and had forgotten to dodge. His legs trembled as the xenogeneic approached, right until the moment the creature annihilated his head and painted the surroundings with his brain.</p>

<p>“Fall back! Fall back!” The leader fired his gun at the xenogeneic.</p>

<p>When the bullets hit the foe, they crackled against him like fireworks. They didn’t even break the skin, though.</p>

<p>“Report! Xenogeneic discovered in the south-west” The leader barked his report into his phone, all the while shooting at the enemy.</p>

<p>The xenogeneic didn’t even seem to notice the bullets. He just jumped back towards Long, who had only just gotten back on his feet.</p>

<p>Long’s face turned white. It was too late for him to dodge, and he had no shield. He lifted his sword and brought it down toward the xenogeneic’s hand.</p>

<p>The xenogeneic’s hand grabbed the sword. The creature gently pressed on it, and it shattered. The creature’s other hand was moving forward to grab Long’s head, though.</p>

<p>There was nowhere Long could run, and he abandoned all hope. He fell back, wanting to escape, but he was far slower than the xenogeneic. Dodging was a futile endeavor.</p>

<p>Just as the hand was coming down to plant itself on Long’s face, a fist wrapped in black armor appeared above him. It punched the xenogeneic right on its temple, knocking the creature away.</p>

<p>The punch did not hurt the xenogeneic, but it freed Long. And when he turned to look at the savior-fist, he noticed it was the doing of none other than Han Sen.</p>

<p>Long looked at Han Sen with a complicated expression.</p>

<p>Han Sen was surprised by what he had done, too. He had gathered up all the strength of his Spell geno armor to deliver that punch. He punched the xenogeneic’s head, but all it had done was knock the creature off-balance for a few steps. The geno armor wasn’t comparable to the xenogeneic.</p>

<p>The xenogeneic looked at Han Sen and then jumped towards him. It was so fast, it was like a shadow.</p>

<p>“Run!” Suo Tu picked up Long and shouted at Han Sen. Han Sen could not outrun their foe, though.</p>

<p>Not that Han Sen planned on running. He was very calm and confident, and his steps were as gentle as the slithering of a snake. He lowered himself into a beautiful fighting form.</p>

<p>The xenogeneic’s power was stronger than Han Sen’s, but that did not mean he could not rival it.</p>

<p>Han Sen’s power and speed were nothing compared to what could be achieved in the geno universe, but his combat skills were the best.</p>

<p>Han Sen pushed his movement to the max, making his body bob and weave, left and right. No one could predict where he was going.</p>

<p>The xenogeneic tried to jump and catch Han Sen, but it couldn’t lay a finger on him.</p>

<p>Suo Tu and the team were frozen in shock at the spectacle. Although the creature was only a step behind Han Sen, he was not at all frightened. Each of his movements was made with absolute composure and calm, and he managed to avoid the xenogeneic’s attacks each and every time. It was rather difficult to believe.</p>

<p>Han Sen’s speed was not too far off Suo Tu’s, but it was still quite slow compared to the xenogeneic. But he could dodge the xenogeneic’s attack all the same, and the xenogeneic couldn’t even scrape his armor. It was very surprising.</p>

<p>Han Sen used his abilities of prediction and judgment to lead the enemy north.</p>

<p>Han Sen wouldn’t be able to kill the vile thing with his own power, so he wanted to draw it to Mister Tiger. Perhaps the Noble could get rid of it.</p>

<p>The soldiers had cameras, and when Han Sen’s group was attacked, those at CIC could view the situation.</p>

<p>“Damn! There are two xenogeneics. What do we do? Mister Tiger is already dealing with one, and we can’t deal with the other. We should have invited Mister Allan.” Commander Guris’ forehead was sweating.</p>

<p>“Wait a minute. There’s a soldier leading the xenogeneic at eleven o’clock,” a moderator shouted.</p>

<p>The commander could not believe that “No way! How can an ordinary soldier do that?”</p>

<p>When he saw it clearly, he was shocked. The soldier’s body was moving left and right, and you could see that he was not scared. He was intimidating to watch.</p>

<p>The xenogeneic was chasing the man, unable to hurt him. The soldier was evidently leading it in a particular direction.</p>

<p>“Who is that soldier?” Commander Guris was frozen in awe. Han Sen was like an artist. He had never before seen someone move with such grace and dexterity.</p>

<p>“Sir, his name is Han Sen. He is the outsider Hardman brought in,” the moderator said.</p>

<p>“The outsider that was able to make the flowers chime but failed to become a Noble?” Commander Guris mumbled to himself. Then, his face changed. He grabbed the phone and said, “Don’t draw the xenogeneic to eleven o’ clock, do you hear me? Answer me!”</p>

<p>Mister Tiger was already fighting a xenogeneic, and if another one joined the fight, he’d be in danger. If that occurred, the operation would be over.</p>
