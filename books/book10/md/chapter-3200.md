“Looking back and smiling, Bai Meisheng, the sixth palace has no color…”

It was such a beautiful poem. The scene made people’s hearts jump.

Now, Thousand Mile Reach had an old face. With his white beard and hair, the expression he had made him appear exceptionally pretty when he looked back.

They could see the corners of his eyes fly. His eyes looked as if they were hooking onto someone. They were so sensual but with an evil undertone.

Han Sen, Qin Bai, and the other people were given a chill. They all strangely watched the scene in front of them. That was especially true of Qin Bai. His impression of Thousand Mile Reach was that he was a little cold but a very righteous person. He was like an old bookworm. Qin Bai never dreamed he might have a face that could display emotions like this. It drove him insane.

Seeing Thousand Mile Reach’s intoxicated eyes follow the twist of his body as he turned around, he looked horny and slutty. That horniness was cheaply displayed. It was like a stereotypical example of whore.

Han Sen, Bao’er, Qin Bai, and Jia Shi Zhen stood together. With their mouths agape, they watched Thousand Mile Reach twist his ridiculous body. It appeared he was dancing.

If the dance was performed by a beautiful woman, everyone would have enjoyed it or had some thoughts that could not be described. But this was an old man twisting his hips as he danced. He was doing all kinds of sexy and seductive movements. He even put his legs out to stroke them. It was the sort of scene that made people freeze in place. A chill ran down Jia Shi Zhen’s spine. Her stomach churned. She now understood why Jian Bu Gu looked so strange whenever he talked about the sword. “Teacher Jian said he was beaten by this sword. Did he…” As Jia Shi Zhen thought about this weird scene, it made her shiver.

Han Sen was thinking the same thing. He wanted to know what it would be like if it was Jian Bu Gu dancing this way.

In the next second, something even more shocking happened. Thousand Mile Reach kept dancing but started taking off his robes. He was like some stripper trying to tease the audience. He threw his robes at them.

Han Sen and the others almost felt their jaws drop. They started to duck and dive. No one wanted to touch those robes.

Qin Bai looked very weird. He wanted to laugh, but he did not dare do so. His face was red. He was on the cusp of shouting, “Take it off!”

He was shocked and surprised. It was hard to remember that Thousand Mile Reach was the man who had been teaching him ever since he was a child. Now, he had been reduced to behaving like this.

As he watched, Qin Bai looked delighted. “How is Thousand Mile Reach going to act all high and mighty toward me in the future?” Jia Shi Zhen forced herself not to laugh and looked at Han Sen. “Mister Han, what do we do now? Should we control Thousand Mile Reach first?”

Han Sen looked at Thousand Mile Reach, who was dancing and taking his clothes off. He was silent a moment before replying, “This sword is not mysterious or evil. It is like Mister Jian said. It is not dangerous. I suppose we shouldn’t do anything. We should not invoke the anger of that sword. If we do that, things might get worse.”

Jia Shi Zhen looked weird as she nodded. “Yes, I supposed Mister Jian was right. I just don’t know how we are supposed to return Thousand Mile Reach to normal.”

While the two of them were talking, Thousand Mile Reach had already taken off all his clothes except for his white underwear. He had revealed his leathery, dried skin.

He looked at Han Sen and the others. He put his foot on a stone and winked at his audience. He stroked his old legs seductively. It was a scene that made Han Sen and the others almost throw up.

Suddenly, Thousand Mile Reach looked as if he was having a stroke. He instantly stopped where he was and did not move. His eyes made it look like he had been possessed. It was like the off switch had been flipped.

Thousand Mile Reach’s eyes looked bright. He looked at Han Sen and the others for a few seconds. He then let out a sob that could shock the sky. When they heard it, that crying made others want to cry. If a crying baby heard in the middle of the night, it would stop crying.

A little while later, Thousand Mile Reach put his clothes back on. His old face still kept turning green and white. He just stood there. It was like he had received many hits to the face.

Han Sen and Jia Shi Zhen knew now was not the best time to talk to Thousand Mile Reach, so they did not even attempt to comfort him. If they comforted him now, it would be like throwing gasoline on an open bonfire.

“Cough. Cough. Teacher Jia, why don’t you try and take the sword too?” Han Sen suggested.

Qin Bai agreed. “Yes! Yes! Yes! Teacher Jia is so smart, you might gain the approval of the sword.”

Jia Shi Zhen looked at them both, trying to feign innocence. When she thought about doing the same things Thousand Mile Reach did, it made her blush.

“These two men are so evil.” Jia Shi Zhen knew what the pair were thinking, but she didn’t openly air her grievances. She pretended nothing happened. She looked at Han Sen and said, “I and Thousand Mile Reach are too similar. If Thousand Mile Reach cannot succeed, then I cannot succeed either. But Mister Han, you can teach Mister Crown Prince a sword mind in just two days. Your sword-mind level must be the highest here. I earnestly believe you have what it takes to claim the sword.”

“Yes! Yes! Yes!” Qin Bai squealed in support. “I think only you can claim that sword.”

Han Sen felt conflicted. The sword was old. If he had seen it correctly, that sword had already broken the world. Otherwise, it would not have been able to affect Thousand Mile Reach so effectively and make him lose control of his body.

He believed it would be great to have a sword like that. If he wanted to conquer a sword like that, he knew it was not going to be easy.

Han Sen thought, “Since I am here, I might as well give it a shot. Plus, there is no suppression in this part of the universe. No matter how strong it is, I should not end up losing control of myself. He nodded and said, “OK, I will give it a go.”

“Mister Han, be wary of the power the sword holds,” Thousand Mile Reach said as he stood tall, frosty, and stiff. “Ordinary material power does not work on it.”

“Thank you, Teacher Thousand Mile Reach.” Han Sen was grateful for the reminder. Being able to shirk his shame and remind Han Sen of that showed just how much of an honorable elder Thousand Mile Reach was.

Han Sen thought about the way Thousand Mile Reach had acted. The image he had built was quick to cave in on itself. He had to force his face not to crack.

“One-inch thinking, then one-inch grey. Was that poem born with the sword, or was it added to the sword later?” Han Sen walked in front of the sword and thought about it.

Soldier Knife Sky’s weapons were made of two things. They were all half weapon and half gene race. It was normal for them to have words. They had seen many carvings and symbols across many of the weapons in that land.

But those few words did not seem to match the feelings of the sword itself. It led Han Sen to think maybe someone had engraved the words onto it.
