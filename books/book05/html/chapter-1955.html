<p>Han Sen initially didn’t want Little Seven to participate in the
battle body races, but when he heard what they could win if Little
Seven achieved first place, he changed his mind. It was a battle
body fluid synthesized by the Meka themselves.</p>
<p>Battle body fluid could level Little Seven up. It could turn
Baron battle bodies into Viscounts. For the Meka, this was
great.</p>
<p>Mach offered Han Sen a very good deal, and Little Seven showed
interest in giving it a shot. So, Han Sen agreed to
participate.</p>
<p>He signed a contract with Mach. If Little Seven achieved a good
result, he could even gain shares in Mach’s company. The better
Little Seven did, the more shares Han Sen would receive.</p>
<p>If he earned first place in the Baron team, they could gain a
forty percent share of the business.</p>
<p>Mach helped Little Seven sign up. He got the permit to join very
quickly, and Han Sen took Little Seven to take part in a few of the
early matches.</p>
<p>The other young Meka Barons could not compete with Little Seven.
He kept winning over and over, which made him ecstatic. He began to
draw the attention of important members of the audience.</p>
<p>Inside a Meka King’s palace, Clear Sea King and a Meka King were
watching the Baron battle body races.</p>
<p>“Amitabha! Making this trade will require a lot of effort on
your part,” Clear Sea King said to the Meka King.</p>
<p>That King looked like a giant bear. And while it munched on
food, it responded, “It’s fine. If you have enough Galaxy Sand, we
can give you as many babies as you want.”</p>
<p>Clear Sea King watched the match without expression. “Galaxy
Sand is not a problem, but I need some good Meka children. There
are a few babies here I really like, so please help me acquire
them.”</p>
<p>“Some of the young ones who have joined the matches are from big
families. I can try to get some of the other ones, but the prices?”
Battle King stopped talking, but his meaning was obvious.</p>
<p>“I will give you ten times as much Galaxy Sand as we discussed.
What do you think?” Clear Sea King said calmly, pointing out the
competitors that he wanted.</p>
<p>“The ones you have chosen are very talented Meka babies. If you
are not famous, you can’t…” Battle King looked glum.</p>
<p>“I will give you twenty times the Galaxy Sand. This is a serious
offer,” Clear Sea King said simply.</p>
<p>“Okay, good. Then it is a deal.” Battle King agreed.</p>
<p>“Hopefully we can conclude this trade quickly and take those
babies back to the Buddha,” Clear Sea King said. He looked at the
Meka babies in the match, paying particular focus to Little Seven,
who was ravenously chowing down on some fruit.</p>
<p>Little Seven was doing very well in the Baron tier. He had
managed to reach the top ten. Other Baron Meka’s didn’t stand a
chance against him.</p>
<p>Little Seven kept winning and winning, and his renown soon
started to spread. He quickly became a Meka superstar.</p>
<p>He ate a geno fruit every time he competed, which was something
others soon came to notice, as well.</p>
<p>Shortly after, the sales in Mach’s shop started to rise. It
delighted him.</p>
<p>But many people came to Mach’s store to simply ask about Little
Seven, too. He was worried about this, and so he told Han Sen about
it. But even without Mach mentioning it, Han Sen could feel things
going that way.</p>
<p>There were eyes all over him and Little Seven. It seemed
reasonable given the fame that Little Seven had gained, but Han Sen
still felt that something was amiss. There were people watching him
24/7, and their methods of observation were too secretive. They
were not low-class Nobles, either; they had to be Earls, at
least.</p>
<p>If Han Sen did not have his powerful Dongxuan Sutra, he’d have
never noticed that they were observing him.</p>
<p>“Who are these guys?” Han Sen wondered, but then an idea crossed
his mind.</p>
<p>At night, Han Sen took to the streets. He disappeared in the
mall.</p>
<p>After a while, a Meka walked around and around in the mall. He
looked terrible.</p>
<p>“Weird. I thought he was here. How did he just disappear?” the
Meka said to himself. He then reported what had happened through a
communicator. He walked around the mall again, to confirm that Han
Sen and Little Seven were nowhere to be found. Then, he left the
mall.</p>
<p>Han Sen came out from a corner, wearing his Dongxuan Armor. Even
his energy had changed.</p>
<p>He followed the Meka to a giant building, then watched the Meka
enter.</p>
<p>“Isn’t that the building that Clear Sea King went into? Are they
involved? Have they discovered my true identity?” Han Sen thought
to himself.</p>
<p>But that would have been impossible. If Clear Sea King had
discovered that Little Seven’s owner was Han Sen, he would have
attacked already. There would have been no need for him to
wait.</p>
<p>It seemed obvious to Han Sen that their target was Little
Seven.</p>
<p>Han Sen couldn’t go in, but he could sneakily send in Little
Invisible. If Little Invisible could snoop around inside, he would
work like an invisible camera. The only downside was his inability
to record voices.</p>
<p>Han Sen spoke to Little Invisible and placed him on the floor.
The colors on its body changed to mimic the ground underfoot. Then,
it vanished.</p>
<p>Little Invisible’s camouflage was strong. Not even King class
people would notice he was around. Han Sen still worried, of
course, so he waited outside the building. If something happened,
Han Sen would use Red Mist King to go save him.</p>
<p>Luckily, these fears didn’t come to fruition. After a few hours
of waiting, something landed on his shoulder. It was Little
Invisible.</p>
<p>Han Sen brought Little Invisible back to Mach’s shop. He went to
his room and sat down with Little Invisible.</p>
<p>“Little Invisible, what did you see?” Han Sen asked.</p>
<p>Little Invisible’s color started to change. It was like watching
a show. It displayed the palace. After Han Sen watched was
revealed, his face got all gloomy. Now he knew why they had their
eyes on Little Seven.</p>
<p>Little Invisible had shown Han Sen many imprisoned Meka babies.
Some of them had done quite well in the races.</p>
<p>“Meka have a complicated blood lineage. Sometimes, they sell out
their own. But I cannot believe a King class elite would merrily
sell off their own kind like that. Clear Sea King is here to buy
them, but for what purpose?” Han Sen wondered.</p>
