    <p>
      After finishing his task on the warship, Han Sen had some free time again
      to enter God’s Sanctuary.
    </p>

    <p>
      Yang Manli had finished recruiting. 80 to 90% of the people living in that
      area joined Goddess Gang that Han Sen had formed and signed formal
      contracts.
    </p>

    <p>
      Although Han Sen needed to provide some meat at low costs, it was nothing
      compared to what he had gained. When he was ready to conquer the spirit
      shelter, all these people needed to play a part. Yang Manli told Han Sen
      that the recruitment did not go well initially. Because Uncle Qing was the
      first to join the gang, everyone else followed.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen nodded and did not speak. The Nings were expressing kindness to
      him, but Han Sen did not dare to treat them as friends. He still knew too
      little about things in the past, so he could not decide whether the Nings
      were friends or enemies.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Now that Goddess Gang is formed, what’s your next move?&#8221; Yang
      Manli asked Han Sen. She was quite reluctant to call the gang Goddess
      Gang, because there were less than ten women in the entire gang, and none
      of them could be called a goddess.
    </p>

    <p>
      However, Han Sen insisted on the name. Since it was just a name, Yang
      Manli did not care.
    </p>

    <p>
      She did not know that in Han Sen’s eyes, the gang members recruited at
      this point were all just the help. The Goddess Gang he was going to
      formulate was a group of spirit beauties.
    </p>

    <p>
      Wherever he appeared in the future, three thousand spirit beauties would
      clear the way for him, which would be a dream coming true.
    </p>

    <p>
      Of course, the condition was that his super body king spirit could make
      spirits give their allegiance to him. Otherwise, his dream would just be a
      dream. Not to mention a group, he would not even be able to get a few
      spirits working for him.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Let them gobble up the meat first, and then we will train them and
      select the best of them to form the backbone of Goddess Gang. Then, we’ll
      go conquer the spirit shelter.&#8221; Han Sen was waiting for zero to come
      and take her to smash the spirit shelter, so he would spend the time to
      train these people.
    </p>

    <p>
      These people did not really take much training, because those who had
      entered Second God’s Sanctuary were either veterans who had gone through
      the military service or current soldiers who were still serving. With some
      light training, they could cooperate pretty well.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen asked Yang Manli to pick a team which he will lead to hunt, so
      that he could check out if there were any talented people among them.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Young master, if you want to hunt, I know exactly the place that
      suits the team,&#8221; suggested Uncle Qing when he heard Han Sen was
      going to do that.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen heeded his advice and asked him to lead the way. The team marched
      toward the glaciers uncle Qing was talking about.
    </p>

    <p>
      Although it was an area of glaciers, avalanche or accidents rarely
      happened. Han Sen did not worry about that. All they had run into on the
      way was a few ice-armored beasts, so Han Sen did not bother to move.
      Riding on the back of the golden growler, Han Sen was reading as he ate
      the jerked bird leg of the evil-blooded condor while watching the team
      hunt.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen looked through the database on Daphne for information about beast
      soul glyphs and indeed found something.
    </p>

    <p>
      No one had ever discovered beast soul glyphs in First God’s Sanctuary, but
      the beast soul type started to come up in Second God’s Sanctuary and
      above. In addition, only mutant or sacred-blood creatures would produce
      beast soul glyphs.
    </p>

    <p>
      The functions of beast soul glyphs were very complicated. Each one had its
      own unique function. In conclusion, a beast soul glyph would give its user
      a certain ability.
    </p>

    <p>
      For example, there was a kind of bear glyph that could enhance one’s
      strength, and there was a wind beast glyph that would increase the user’s
      speed.
    </p>

    <p>
      Since no one had hunted an evil-blooded condor before, Han Sen was not
      sure what kind of ability he would get. He had been observing for days and
      did not discover anything different when using the beast soul.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;So, what is the function of the evil-blooded condor glyph?&#8221;
      Han Sen could not figure it out and had to put it aside.
    </p>

    <p>
      At this point, Han Sen finally understood how great it was to be a gang
      leader. Watching his subordinates killing creatures bravely, Han Sen knew
      that he would eventually gain the better half of their labor.
    </p>

    <p>
      There were not a lot of members in the gang at the moment. In the future,
      if the Goddess Gang had thousands or tens of thousands of members, he
      would be able to receive a significant amount of income from his cut of
      everyday hunting.
    </p>

    <p>
      It was equally beneficial to the gang members. Compared to hunting alone,
      it was much easier to hunt in a gang. At the same time, the income was
      equally good or even better. Their safety was also enhanced.
    </p>

    <p>
      Of course, because it was a tough area, and most places were unknown to
      man, it was still dangerous to hunt even in the group. Without a master
      fighter in the gang, everyone would die once they encountered strong
      mutant creatures or sacred-blood creatures.
    </p>

    <p>
      They were not used to hunting blatantly like this for fear that there
      might be a group of creatures attacking them. Following Han Sen, however,
      they could quit sneaking around. Although they felt anxious, they felt
      much better than before.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Young master, let’s stay in this area. If we move further, there
      might be mutant creatures.&#8221; Uncle Qing stopped and said to Han Sen.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Let’s continue. Mutant creatures are even better,&#8221; Han Sen
      commanded the team to go forward, because he was not that interested in
      hunting primitive creatures.
    </p>

    <p>
      Although they were following Han Sen’s order, many people started to feel
      worried, looking left and right for fear that there might really be mutant
      creatures.
    </p>

    <p>
      The only person able to fight a mutant creature in this place was Uncle
      Qing. If others encountered mutant creatures, they were likely to become a
      meal of the creatures.
    </p>

    <p>
      Although Yang Manli wanted to talk Han Sen out of it, she knew it would
      not serve any purpose, because Han Sen would not listen to her at all.
      Yang Manli ended up saying nothing.
    </p>

    <p>
      Uncle Qing did not argue either, continuing to lead the way. It was as if
      as long as Han Sen gave his words, Uncle Qing would do anything for Han
      Sen.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen continued to read his ancient language textbook. As long as he had
      time, Han Sen would still learn the ancient language, hoping to understand
      Dongxuan Sutra as soon as possible.
    </p>

    <p>
      However, Dongxuan Sutra was so archaic that Han Sen was only able to
      understand a small part of it at this point, and that was not even the
      important part.
    </p>

    <p>
      All of a sudden, they heard loud hoof beat and beast roar. A giant
      elephant with white fur rushed toward them from afar, leaving one huge
      footprint after another. All the glaciers seemed to be shaking. Snowflakes
      were flowing everywhere.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;White mammoth!&#8221; Someone suddenly exclaimed. The entire group
      scattered like a mob.
