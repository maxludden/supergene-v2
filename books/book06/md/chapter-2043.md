  The giant Spiky Turtle was swimming deep into the sea. Han Sen hung onto to creature, using its large body to avoid the scary shockwaves as they went. When he reached an area outside of the effective radius of the shockwaves, he let go of the turtle. He looked over his shoulder and saw many Spiky Turtles swimming deep into the sea around them.

Han Sen was afraid he might have swum too deep. He didn’t want to escape from the shockwave, only to become food for the xenogeneics that lurked in the depths of the sea. So, he didn’t dive any further.

While Han Sen floated in the sea, he saw a familiar face approach. It was Xius,

the Gana.

She was different from the Gana sisters that Han Sen knew. Xius wasn’t one of the Gana nobility, and she was strong.

Han Sen frowned, but he did not abandon his place. Going upwards would take him back to where the dual-wielding turtle and the Dragon God fought. Waiting here seemed like his best option.

Your name is San Mu?” Xius asked, coming next to Han Sen. “Not bad. Is there something you need?” Han Sen watched Xius carefully.

Xius smiled. “It is rare to see crystallizers here. It is even rarer to find an Earl like you. I have heard Knife Queen has a crystallizer student. He goes by the name of Han Sen. Do you know him?”

The sudden question caught Han Sen off guard, but he kept his expression from changing. “I don’t know every other crystallizer out there, but I am familiar with Han Sen. He is our pride and joy, but I’m afraid he does not know me.”

Xius sighed and looked at Han Sen. “Han Sen is indeed someone to be proud of. He killed Dragon Thirteen and Sharon. That is an extraordinarily rare feat for an Earl. Unfortunately, he disappeared in the Ancient God space. I would like to see him. Do you know where he might be found?”

“I am afraid I will have to disappoint you, as I am just an ordinary crystallizer. I do not know Han Sen personally enough to know where he might be,” Han Sen said casually

Han Sen remained outwardly calm, but his stomach was churning. It looked like the deaths of Dragon Thirteen and Sharon had become rather well-known. That meant if the Dragon found out who he really was, they’d be inclined to kill him.

When Xius opened her mouth to say something else, a shadow approached. Dragon Fifteen and Long Ying were coming.

They moved in front of Han Sen and Xius like the dragons they were.

Dragon Fifteen looked at Han Sen, and his expression was unreadable. Then, he spoke to Xius, “Xius, this place is dangerous. Why don’t I let Long Ying take you

somewhere safe?”

“A fight like this is a rare sight. Danger is a price worth paying.” Xius smiled. She had no intention of leaving.

Instead of responding, Dragon Fifteen punched Han Sen

He gathered a lot of power in that punch, and his fist slipped through the water like a needle. The water resistance didn’t even slow it down, and it came right for

Han Sen.

Dragon Fifteen wanted to kill Han Sen before the two monsters were done fighting. Han Sen was familiar with this power, though. He wouldn’t soon forget the Evilbreaker power of the Dragon. When Dragon Fifteen used Evilbreaker power, Han Sen dove deeper into the sea.

Dragon Fifteen was surprised by how swift Han Sen was. “That crystallizer is very strong in the water. He is no worse than a Dragon… He might even be better.”

“Such an evil person! Long Ying, get rid of him.” Dragon Fifteen looked grim. He finally realized that Han Sen had only been pretending to be poorly suited to the water.

“Yes,” Long Ying answered. She flapped her wings like a raptor, sending powerful gusts of water behind her as she shot off after Han Sen into the deep

sea.

Han Sen saw the speed with which she was approaching, and he knew he would lose if he did not do something soon. He kept swimming down for the moment, though. Long Ying closed on him. Her lance split the water hungrily, thrusting towards Han Sen.

Han Sen moved, evading the Evilbreaker Lance. Long Ying hummed, and then her lance underwent a transformation. A dragon appeared on it, and its speed increased. It disappeared, only to reappear and pierce through Han Sen’s head.

Pang! Han Sen’s body exploded like a water balloon, but there was no blood.

“A clone of Moon?” Long Ying frowned. The clone looked so real, it had even tricked her. That pissed her off.

She looked around, and she realized that Han Sen was gone.

She released her Dragon presence to find Han Sen, but she could not detect him at all. He was outside the radius of a thousand meters. Long Ying frowned.

Han Sen was clinging to the bottom of a blue shark like a barnacle. He used his Dongxuan Aura to mask his presence, before allowing the shark to take him deep into the sea.

Once he reached the bottom, Han Sen looked around. There was a lot of coral nearby, growing together like a section of forest. He didn’t enter there, though. Instead, he dropped to the sand and started to dig into it.

Not long after, Long Ying reached the bottom of the sea. She looked around and swung her Dragon lance. A sharp lance light swept across the coral like a scythe cutting hay. The coral broke, and many of the xenogeneics within were killed. The sea was dyed red.

“This guy is good at running off.” Long Ying frowned. She looked around, then headed off in a different direction.

Han Sen did not move an inch beneath the sand, and he had no intention of leaving. A few minutes later, Long Ying returned.

“Strange. Where did he go?” Long Ying searched around again, then left the sea bed and returned to Dragon Fifteen. Han Sen felt relieved. He emerged from the sand and hid himself inside a seashell.

The shells were two meters tall, and they had been living in the coral. They had died to Long Ying”s lance. After hiding himself on their remains, Han Sen summoned Spell in her sniper rifle form. He wanted to see if the long range scope would work beneath the sea.

It worked. Han Sen hid inside the shell, but from down there, he could see Dragon Fifteen, Long Ying, and Xius a few thousand meters away. He could not hear what they were saying, but he was pretty good at reading lips.
