  Xie Qing King was not as optimistic about this as Han Yufei was. He worriedly said, “If there is an elite out there who can break the barrier between worlds to enter our universe, it could very well be a grave disaster for us all.”

Han Yufei shook her head and said, “You think too much. If they break the world and come, then the rules of our universe will restrict them. It will be just like Qin Xiu back then. No matter how strong he was or how many God Spirits he was able to kill when he came to our universe, he was unable to defeat the true elites. He could not fight for long.”

“Qin Xiu traveled here solo, but this time the path between worlds is opened. There is a difference between these two events.” Xie Qing King did not agree with Han Yufei.

Han Yufei did not want to argue with him. She coldly said, “If there is danger, we cannot do anything to stop it. If you are going to bleed your worries over everything this early, why not be more productive and figure out how to level up to protect yourself?” “You are right,” Xie Qing King said with a laugh. “What you are saying, Sister Yufei, is the best course of action.” He was trying to lick her boots.

Xie Qing King was very overbearing. He was not afraid of the sky, and he was not afraid of the earth. He was not afraid of Han Yufei. Since Han Yufei had conducted some research in Space Garden, the creatures of Space Garden had leveled up a lot. He was one of them, so Xie Qing King admired her.

Of course, Han Yufei was always a prankster. She always did some tests that seemed like they were unnecessary and weird. It made Xie Qing King suffer. He felt weird whenever he thought about them.

“Breaking through a path between the two worlds is great,” Tang Zhenliu said. “We can search for Han Sen in the antimaterial world. He cannot be allowed to become famous alone.”

“Right,” Han Yufei quietly said.

Xie Qing King suggested that if there was a way to break through the Mirror Lake and get the path to be opened sooner, that would have been best.

People from the sanctuaries were all very powerful. Most people agreed with that. Very High Leader was shocked, so he sought to stop them from attempting that.

In the end, Han Menger helped be a voice for the Very High. She made them hold off on their idea.

Han Menger was there representing Sky Palace. The changes that were happening in Mirror Lake could affect the entire geno universe. Sky Palace would not sit idly by without letting their voices be heard.

Han Yufei walked to the kitchen to make tea. Han Menger went with her and said, “If I had Break World powers, I could go to the next world and find father.”

Han Yufei touched Han Menger’s head. Only she could do this to Han Menger, who always looked so cold.

“Of course not. The Break World powers are special powers that combine main and reverse world powers. Having a Break World power does not mean you actually break worlds. Your body needs to be strong, so you can be strong enough to break the barrier between worlds.” Han Yufei paused to think a moment before saying, “Back then, Qin Xiu’s Break World power was strong, but he was unable to use his own power to break it. He had a gap between the universes and built a path from there. That is how he went into our geno universe. When he came to us, he was bound by the restrictions of the universe. He was separate from his gene race, which reduced his effectiveness in the geno universe.”

“In that way, the rules of the universe clamped down on him to make him weak. He lost the power to break worlds. Everything had to be started again, and he had to get used to the geno universe from scratch. He had to learn our geno universe powers. I have to admit that Qin Xiu was a genius who was very talented. Although he had to learn the geno universe’s powers again, he grew up fast and became nearly invincible before the end.”

Han Menger quietly listened to Han Yufei and asked, “Where did Qin Xiu come from?”

“He came from Mirror Lake,” Han Yufei said with a smile. She quickly added, “But World King God’s power is a world power, and Qin Xiu’s God Spirit Blood-Pulse power is a time and space element. When combined, the two create the Break World power. It enabled a power to travel between worlds. That was how he was able to use a glitch and enter the geno universe. Otherwise, if someone did not have the same power he did, people could not come here alone.”

Han Menger sounded disappointed. “Aside from breaking Mirror Lake, does that mean there are no other means to reach the other world?”

“It is not that there is absolutely no way. We used to research and create god temples. We could then use those god temples to travel through space and reach the other world. These tests came so close to success, but there was a god fight and Sacred broke. Our created god temples were destroyed. The information and data were lost. To get the information again and create a manmade god temple is not something that can be done in a short amount of time.” Han Yufei patted Han Menger on the head and said, “Do not worry. No matter where he has ended up, a man like Han Sen is likely doing just fine.” Han Sen really was fine. In the Feng family’s castle, he was like a king. He had people serving him around the clock, all the while he wined, dined, sipped, and sucked on the nicest food and drinks one could receive.

“Han Sen, are you really coming with me to join the sacrificial ceremony?” Qin Bai felt rather worried about it.

Although he would have two servants joining the ceremony, they were servants. They were the ones who reminded Qin Bai what he would need to do in the ceremonies.

The sacrificial ceremony was very complicated. Ordinary people could not remember all the procedures of the ritual. That was why there were servants.

If he swapped Han Sen with one of them and something went wrong, Qin Jingzhen would not let that go.

“Do not worry,” Han Sen said to comfort him. “I can see through the hearts of people. I can just read a servant’s memory and remember the entire procedure without missing a beat. It won’t go awry.” “Two? I thought you were going alone.” Qin Bai’s eyes opened wide.

Han Sen smiled. He pointed at Bao’er. “Bao’er and I will disguise ourselves as servants and go with you.”

Qin Bai shook his head. “You can disguise as a servant, but Bao’er is too small. How can she not be discovered?”

Bao’er rolled her eyes at Qin Bai. She used her sunglasses. Qin Bai froze at the sight of what she became. She looked just like Qin Bai.

“Not just a servant, but I can even disguise myself as you if you want,” Bao’er said. Her speech mannerisms were just like Qin Bai too.

Qin Bai was not shocked. Instead, he was happy. “Bao’er, you have such amazing powers. Why don’t you just pretend to be me? I don’t want to go to those boring ceremonies anyway.” Han Sen shook his head. “No. This is the Qin family’s Blood-Pulse sacrifice ceremony. Even though Bao’er can look like you, she does not have the king’s blood. If something happens, we cannot lie our way out of it. The officers will never forgive you. It is likely the king never would either.”

Qin Bai looked sad. “All right. Tomorrow, you guys come to the palace. The two servants will teach me the procedure. Then, you will replace them. In two days, we can go to the alpha’s temple and participate in the ceremony.”

Qin Bai thought having Bao’er and Han Sen around would not be so boring.
