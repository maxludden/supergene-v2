    <p>
      Every media outlet reported on the event, how a man in his twenties
      effortlessly beat a royal shura. To humanity, this was a tremendously
      exciting affair.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen, furthermore, was the future son-in-law of the president. Due to
      his prestige, all the citizens of the Alliance developed a keen interest
      in him. They wanted to learn every detail they could about him, large and
      small. Many people even questioned the manners and etiquette he employed
      when visiting the bathroom.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen had been born into an ordinary family, but his father died while
      he was still young. Therefore, he was raised primarily by his mother. He
      initially went to a public school, but after much struggle, managed to
      enter a high-class military school. That was where he met the
      president&#8217;s daughter, from which they ignited a spark and kindled a
      romance. From a middling, lowly heritage to one of great renown, his life
      was the perfect example of a classic success story. Onwards and upwards,
      his life and prestige did not seem to slow down.
    </p>

    <p>
      Lin Feng went to visit Huang Xiao numerous times, and when he came this
      time, he brought with him a demigod healer to aid in his restoration. Over
      a short amount of time, his wounds sealed and the previous damages
      weren&#8217;t very visible.
    </p>

    <p>
      The Alliance did everything they could to reduce the damages he suffered,
      but not all their efforts were successful. His brain had received a cruel
      amount of damage, and many parts of it had been utterly destroyed, beyond
      healing or repair. Neither technology nor skills could help. Because of
      this, Huang Xiao&#8217;s body suffered a number of problems.
    </p>

    <p>
      However, the efforts of the Alliance that were focused on minimizing his
      lasting disabilities were mostly a success. The biggest problem that
      remained was his movement. While most of his body functioned correctly,
      there were occasional issues with his movement that could not be solved or
      overcome. For example, when he wanted to reach into his pockets, he had
      trouble guiding his hands into the entrance of his pockets accurately.
    </p>

    <p>To a fighter of such caliber, this was disastrous.</p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Do not worry for my future well-being. While my body may remain
      permanently damaged, my mind and my consciousness are the same as they
      always have been. Even if I can&#8217;t fight anymore, I can put this
      battered brain to use elsewhere.&#8221; Huang Xiao was more optimistic
      than was expected. He hadn&#8217;t been emotionally crushed by what had
      transpired, and when he spoke, a fire was still alight in his eyes. They
      told everyone that what he was saying was most earnest and true.
    </p>

    <p>…&#8230;</p>

    <p>
      After the fight, Han Sen had indeed become rather famous. His feat made
      others acknowledge his true fitness level, and people now knew it had to
      be at least over two hundred. But people also knew that it was impossible
      for evolvers to go that high, unless he had somehow managed to absorb Life
      Geno Essences and had earned himself super geno points.
    </p>

    <p>
      People frequently discussed all sorts of topics relating to Han Sen.
      Officers, on the other hand, were only thinking and whispering of a way in
      which they might get him to reveal his secret to absorbing Life Geno
      Essences.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen&#8217;s communicator hadn&#8217;t stopped ringing since the night
      of the fight, so he turned it off.
    </p>

    <p>
      But when he refused to allow his communicator to keep ringing, the same
      could not be said for others of the Ji family. The rest of the family was
      pestered by people who wanted Han Sen&#8217;s knowledge.
    </p>

    <p>
      The reason Ji Ruozhen became president was not his own power. He had ties
      and alliances to many factions, families, and organizations in high
      places. As a result, he could not deny their requests.
    </p>

    <p>
      Ji Ruozhen went to talk with Han Sen and asked him about it. Regardless of
      whether or not he had absorbed Life Geno Essences, he had to appease the
      Alliance with an answer. He couldn&#8217;t ignore their inquisitiveness
      forever.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen did not hesitate or lie in his response. Quickly and
      affirmatively, he said, &#8220;I have obtained super geno points,
      yes.&#8221;
    </p>

    <p>
      When Han Sen went to fight Yu Qielan, he deliberated the consequences of
      revealing so much. Ji Ruozhen&#8217;s question did not come as a surprise,
      and so Han Sen&#8217;s response was prepared.
    </p>

    <p>Ji Ruozhen fell silent upon hearing Han Sen&#8217;s confirmation.</p>

    <p>
      After a certain amount of time elapsed, he said to Han Sen, &#8220;Tell me
      what you can.&#8221;
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen smiled and said, &#8220;There is no secret. It is easy to obtain
      super geno points; you simply need to find the eggs of a super creature.
      One that is semi-composed inside its shell. Eat it and you will receive
      super geno points. That is where I get mine from.&#8221;
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Really?&#8221; Ji Ruozhen asked, shocked. He did not expect the
      answer to be so simple.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;On my own life, I pledge to you that this is not incorrect,&#8221;
      Han Sen said.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Good. This is an important discovery, and one that means a lot to
      the future progression of humanity.&#8221; Ji Ruozhen did not stop there,
      and he continued by saying, &#8220;Do not worry any further. The Ji family
      will handle all the matters pertaining to this revelation. And the
      benefits you will receive for this discovery will not disappoint
      you.&#8221;
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen hadn&#8217;t planned on receiving any rewards. Particularly so
      since he didn&#8217;t admit the entire truth. And what&#8217;s more,
      obtaining the eggs of a super creature was a good deal harder than killing
      a super creature outright.
    </p>

    <p>
      Super creatures were not difficult to locate in the Second God&#8217;s
      Sanctuary, but eggs most certainly were. If people wanted to spend their
      time searching for them, Han Sen didn&#8217;t believe their efforts would
      get in his way too much.
    </p>

    <p>
      The chances were extremely low that someone would be lucky enough to find
      such an egg, and further yet manage to kill the super creature that was
      guarding it. And maxing out super geno points by going for eggs alone
      seemed impossible.
    </p>

    <p>
      Back in the sanctuary, Han Sen made plans to leave Moment Shelter. He
      wanted to look for another human shelter so he could finish his deal with
      Tang Zhenliu, by selling him the Life Geno Essence.
    </p>

    <p>
      After leaving the mountain ranges, it wasn&#8217;t too long before he
      found a human shelter where he could finish the transaction. The Tang
      family gifted him ownership of a whole rare metal mine.
    </p>

    <p>
      It was not Z-steel, but the Z-alloy you could get from the mine was quite
      important to have. It was expensive, and people were still figuring out
      the qualities and properties of the alloy. As such, the price was still on
      the rise.
    </p>

    <p>
      Inside the Angel Gene office, Zhao Seventh spoke to someone. In the image
      on-screen stood the royal shura that had tried to attack Han Sen after the
      bout.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Mister Zhao, to complete our contract we had to sacrifice one of
      our royal members. Shouldn&#8217;t you do something about this?&#8221; the
      royal shura said to Zhao Seventh.
    </p>

    <p>
      Zhao Seventh coldly responded, &#8220;Preventing the establishment of
      peace is our ultimate goal, and that is not just because of me.
      Furthermore, Yu Qielan&#8217;s death was a result of his own recklessness.
      That is no responsibility of mine.&#8221;
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Mister Zhao, our friend cannot have been slain in vain. Think on it
      some more, because if you don&#8217;t make the right decision, we may have
      to end our cooperative venture,&#8221; the royal shura said firmly.
    </p>

    <p>
      Zhao Seventh frowned, and a look of anger and scorn consumed his face. It
      was only for a moment, and then it left as quickly as it came. He smiled
      and said, &#8220;General Sha Heng, what is it that you want?&#8221;
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;I don&#8217;t care how it is achieved, but the person that slew one
      of ours has to pay. Han Sen must die.&#8221; Sha Heng&#8217;s face
      grimaced with the ugly look of murder.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;No problem. That can be arranged without difficulty. Give me a
      month, and by the end of that timeframe, Han Sen will be gone from the
      face of this world. As for the latest package, please have it delivered on
      time,&#8221; Zhao Seventh said.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;I will await your good news. Until then, consider our deal of
      cooperation terminated,&#8221; Sha Heng said.
    </p>

    <p>&#8220;Fine.&#8221; Zhao Seventh smiled.</p>

    <p>
      After their communication, Zhao Seventh smiled. He called up Zhao Lian and
      coldly told him, &#8220;Take our people to Planet Dong Long, rob their
      supplies, and kill the shura there.&#8221;
    </p>

    <p>
      Zhao Lian was shocked at the sudden order and asked, &#8220;Chairman,
      doesn&#8217;t that mean we will end up as their enemies? What will happen
      to our supplies in the future?&#8221;
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;They are not the only royal shura there. If our arrangement with
      them comes to an end, I am sure another family will be eager to take their
      place.&#8221; Zhao Seventh coldly smiled.
