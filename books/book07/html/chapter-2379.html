<p>Over the next few days, Han Sen didn’t go anywhere. He discussed
Bai Yi with the Siren Virgin for hours on end, trying to memorize
all the important details about the man that he could.</p>
<p>When the exams began, every single person of the Extreme King
would be watching. And of course, King Bai was going to be there.
The chance of his identity being exposed would be the greatest it
had ever been.</p>
<p>“Your personality and Bai Yi’s are way too different. It doesn’t
matter how much you pretend; you two cannot be exactly the same. It
is fortunate that King Bai never loved Bai Yi. Just take care not
to expose yourself, and take solace in the fact that it would be
hard for him to recognize Bai Yi, anyway. And no matter what
happens, you need to stick your guns and tell people you are Bai
Yi. No matter how suspicious others become, they cannot kill you
without solid evidence proving that you are not him.” Siren Virgin
explained things to Han Sen as clearly as she could.</p>
<p>When Han Sen heard what she told him, he felt relieved. It was
just as Siren Virgin said. King Bai had no way of verifying Han
Sen’s identity. If there was a remote chance that Han Sen was his
son, he would not kill him. If he did, King Bai would be known as
the man who murdered his own child. Even if he didn’t mind the
damage his reputation would incur, it would be bad news for the
Extreme King.</p>
<p>The Siren Virgin had addressed Han Sen’s greatest fears, and in
so doing, she had relieved a lot of his anxiety.</p>
<p>“This woman is good! No wonder she handled the Siren Elder so
easily. The old woman died without even realizing what had really
happened,” Han Sen thought in admiration.</p>
<p>He tried to put some power into the Siren Bottle, but it was
like the power was sinking into a bottomless sea. None of his
attempts seemed to work. There wasn’t even a single metaphorical
wave.</p>
<p>After that, Han Sen didn’t dare to test the bottle any further.
He didn’t want to invoke the ire of the Siren Virgin. The Siren
Bottle couldn’t have been any weaker than the Undying Bird’s Nest.
Attempting to use it by force would be difficult, and probably
foolhardy.</p>
<p>On the day of the exam, Han Sen brought the blood kirin, Lilly,
Bao’er, and Lan Haixin with him. It was a whole family outing.</p>
<p>Han Sen hadn’t planned on bringing Lan Haixin, since her
presence could complicate things. But the exams were not just
exams. They were a very important festival for the entire Extreme
King society. All of the royal families had to attend. If Han Sen
didn’t bring Lan Haixin with him, others would find it very
suspicious.</p>
<p>The Extreme King became very festive around the exams. When Han
Sen and Lan Haixin arrived at the exam site, it was already really
crowded. Many of the Extreme King nobles had come there to watch
the royal children.</p>
<p>That day was the opening ceremony, so there were many
traditional events taking place. One of them featured the royal
children going up on stage to show-off. Once they were on the
stage, every royal child had to properly announce themselves to the
rest of the Extreme King.</p>
<p>Of course, the introduction was nothing special. You just had to
declare your name and title. If you added flair to the
introductions, though, that was one way to stand out and make
yourself memorable.</p>
<p>Because of this, all the royal children would be utilizing their
creativity to try to attract the attention of the audience.</p>
<p>After all, the entire geno universe was divided into ranks of
one sort or another. And this was truer than ever when it came to
the hierarchy of the Extreme King. The elites were those who were
known and obeyed, and so the royal children wouldn’t miss out on
this opportunity to make an impression.</p>
<p>After the opening ceremony, it was time for the royal children
to show-off. The first that came out on stage was the crown prince,
Bai Wanjie.</p>
<p>Bai Wanjie was the crown prince, but he was only half-deified.
He wasn’t one of the two deified royals who were attending.</p>
<p>The curtains of the stage pulled back, revealing Bai Wanjie. He
was clad in golden armor, and his gold King area covered the whole
of the Extreme King’s plaza. He was shining so brightly, like a
gold warrior walking down a gold path.</p>
<p>“My name is Bai Wanjie. I am the crown prince.” Bai Wanjie’s
introduction was a simple one, and then he departed the platform of
the Extreme King.</p>
<p>After Bai Wanjie left, a sword light appeared above, tearing
through the sky. The sword light was blindingly bright, and it made
people’s skin feel cold. It seemed to exert pressure on them from
above.</p>
<p>All the princes and princesses came out, and because each one of
them was impressive, none of them were very surprising.</p>
<p>Han Sen looked closer and sighed. There were many elites in the
Extreme King. Many of those royal children could wipe out a lower
race.</p>
<p>The crowd was mostly focused on the two deified children. One of
them was a prince, whereas the other one was a princess. After
those two, the crowd was probably most interested in Bai Ling
Shuang. She was widely considered to be the prettiest woman of the
Extreme King.</p>
<p>But in a discussion of beauty, Han Sen would have leaned toward
Bai Wei. She was just as striking as Bai Ling Shuang. In truth, all
of the royal children looked special, but Bai Ling Shuang was
simply stronger and had more of a reputation.</p>
<p>Soon, it was Han Sen’s—Prince Sixteen’s—time to show off. Han
Sen, when he heard his name get called, had to get up and go to the
door that led out onto the stage.</p>
<p>Many nobles, commoners, and even deified elites were interested
in seeing Bai Yi, known as Prince Sixteen. After all, his two most
recent accomplishments were amazing, if completely unexpected.</p>
<p>Claiming the alpha statue and obtaining the protection of
thousands of Kingese. Either of these acts would have made Bai Yi’s
name a very famous one.</p>
<p>Because of this, people watched Bai Yi expectantly. They were
more focused on him than on the two deified children.</p>
<p>After all, the deified royal children were there every year. But
Bai Yi had been only a cliff note in the past, and his sudden rise
had gotten people curious.</p>
<p>Under the eyes of all, Han Sen slowly walked through the door.
He hadn’t activated an overwhelming King area, and he wasn’t
producing any knife lights or sword lights.</p>
<p>Han Sen, wearing a simple green robe, quietly walked to the
center of the Extreme King’s stage.</p>
<p>“Bai Yi, Extreme King’s sixteenth prince. The number one in this
exam.” After saying this, Han Sen turned around and exited the
stage.</p>
<p>“Blergh!” Prince Nineteen, who had just taken a swig of tea,
spat it out. His eyes opened wide as he watched Han Sen step down
from the Extreme King stage.</p>
<p>The plaza was deathly quiet. No one seemed to know how to
react.</p>
<p>“Old Sixteen is getting crazier and crazier…” Bai Canglang had a
wry smile.</p>
<p>“Every time I think I have a handle on him, this guy does
something even more insane!” Bai Ling Shuang tried to keep her face
expressionless as she wondered if she had signed her own death
sentence by making an alliance with Bai Yi.</p>
<p>“Haha! I like this introduction. It’s aggressive. I have seen so
many of the royal children’s introductions, but this one has to be
the strongest of the lot!”</p>
<p>“Strong? That was stupid. Even if he is a match for most of his
siblings, there are two deified royal children here. How can he
predict he will reach first place?”</p>
<p>“That was pretty dumb, but I liked it.”</p>
<p>“This Prince Sixteen is very interesting.”</p>
<p>The whole of King’s Kingdom was in shock. They were all intently
discussing Prince Sixteen Bai Yi and his controversial
introduction.</p>
<p>Even King Bai, his wife, Ancient Abyss, and the other officials
were all looking at Han Sen.</p>
<p>Han Sen acted as if nothing had happened. He returned to his
seat.</p>
<p>This was what Siren Virgin had helped him understand. He
couldn’t act exactly like Bai Yi, but any action he took had to
drip with certainty. He had to assure others that he was Bai Yi,
and he couldn’t take a single step back. He had to show absolute
confidence.</p>
