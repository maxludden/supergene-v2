<p>“Ha! Ha! Little Sen Sen, you look so much better than how you
used to be,” Xie Qing King said while patting Han Sen on the
head.</p>
<p>“Go to hell. You go to the Flower God Leader and see if they
have finished the geno fluid that was made by the queen flower. I
need it now.” Han Sen pushed Xie Qing King’s hand away. He was
terribly upset by what had become of him.</p>
<p>Xie Qing King was very happy. He patted Han Sen’s head and said,
“You just wait here Little Sen Sen. Big Brother Xie Qing will help
you.”</p>
<p>“Do not tell me about my body’s problems,” Han Sen said. He did
not want this to cause any more trouble.</p>
<p>Xie Qing King agreed and went to the Flower God Leader. He
brought the geno fluid formulated by the queen flower. It was only
a big, hand-sized bottle. It had purple fluid inside it.</p>
<p>Han Sen opened the bottle and had a sip. He soon heard an
announcement.</p>
<p>“Deified gene +1… deified gene +1…”</p>
<p>Han Sen drank it and earned two deified genes. There was still a
lot left inside the bottle.</p>
<p>“That is the right way for a person to increase their deified
genes. I used to keep eating meat that ravaged my bowels for a
measly increase in gene points.” Han Sen sighed.</p>
<p>He thought, If I can increase my deified genes with this, that
means my body is OK. It is leveling up normally, but why do I look
like this? And, why can I not use my powers?</p>
<p>Han Sen was a bit depressed. He drank all of the geno fluid. It
increased his tally of deified genes by seven, but Han Sen’s body
did not recover because of it. He was still unable to feel the
power inside him.</p>
<p>If I can’t keep recovering, I will have to collect 100 deified
genes and see if I can become larvae class. Maybe, just maybe, I
might be able to recover. Han Sen tried to comfort himself.</p>
<p>He had now encountered a very troublesome thing. Han Sen used to
be able to control the red-robed child. He was able to take the
red-robed child with him to kill the plant xenogeneics without any
resistance.</p>
<p>Now, Han Sen was unable to use his powers. He did not dare
consult the red-robed child anymore. It would have been way too
difficult for him to kill the deified plant xenogeneics as
well.</p>
<p>The Flower Gods did not have deified elites in their midst, and
Xie Qing King was only King class. No one there had the ability to
take out a deified xenogeneic.</p>
<p>I have to wait for Bao’er and the little red bird to get here to
hunt deified xenogeneics. Han Sen tried to quell his impatience to
endure the awful time. After Xie Qing King left the Space Garden to
pick up Bao’er, Han Sen practiced his geno arts there to see if he
could somehow trigger something that would return him to how he
used to be.</p>
<p>Because his body was not injured, even if he used his super god
spirit body, he still looked like a child. He was unable to become
normal again.</p>
<p>One day, Han Sen was in his garden practicing his geno arts.
Unfortunately, no progress on returning to his old self had been
made. While he was feeling depressed, someone pushed the gate and
entered his garden.</p>
<p>“Xie Qing King is back that soon?” Han Sen was shocked. Aside
from Xie Qing King, the Flower God people did not randomly choose
to enter his private garden.</p>
<p>With Han Sen’s guess, he also knew Xie Qing King should not have
returned so soon. After a closer inspection, he noticed the entrant
was not Xie Qing King. He was an old man clad in black clothing.
His hair and beard were grey. Honestly, he looked a bit
disgusting.</p>
<p>Han Sen’s heart felt a sudden chill. He did not recall seeing
someone like that inside the Space Garden before. If the old man
was not from the Flower God, he questioned how he was able to gain
access to the Space Garden in the first place.</p>
<p>The old man pushed the gate open and saw Han Sen. His eyes
looked at Han Sen like the eyes of a dead fish. He mumbled, “It is
a xenogeneic that is 6 years old, but he is not wearing red
clothes. He is not bald, either. Is this the one?”</p>
<p>Han Sen heard him and was shocked. The things the old man was
describing had to be about the red-robed child.</p>
<p>This old man has come for the red-robed child, but how did he
gain access to the Space Garden? Han Sen thought. He was in a hurry
now too.</p>
<p>With his body’s condition being what it was, he could not use
power or negotiate with the man.</p>
<p>The old man ignored Han Sen. His eyes had two god lights in
them. He scanned the area around and spoke to himself. “The whole
of the flower city only has one xenogeneic that looks like this.
Clothes can change and hair can grow. This most likely is the one I
am looking for.”</p>
<p>When Han Sen heard that, he developed black lines across his
head. That old man was making the mistake of believing he was the
red-robed child. Han Sen wanted to explain he was not the red-robed
child, but the old man waved his hand to cast a weird power. Han
Sen ended up flying into his sleeves.</p>
<p>Very powerful skill! Han Sen could see that inside the sleeves
was just darkness. He had no idea where he was. It was like its own
independent realm.</p>
<p>How unlucky. Why at this time must a creepy old man be coming
for me? Han Sen was depressed. He was trapped in that dark place
and could not leave. There was nothing he could do.</p>
<p>After the weird old man kidnapped Han Sen, he departed Space
Garden. There were many plant xenogeneics in Space Garden, but Holy
Pirate did not think those low-level plant xenogeneics were
important. He just nabbed Han Sen and made a hasty escape.</p>
<p>The powerful Space Garden was not able to stop the man from
leaving.</p>
<p>The two kept traveling through space. In a few days, that weird
old man was back to where he lived.</p>
<p>Right, Bai Wanjie wanted him alive. I can’t kill him. The weird
old man had thought about Han Sen trapped inside his treasure
sleeve for a few days now. Not wanting him to die, he waved his
sleeves to let Han Sen out.</p>
<p>The weird old man was the Holy Pirate who Bai Wanjie hired. He
was going to steal the red-robed child but had accidentally
kidnapped Han Sen by mistake.</p>
<p>Han Sen had been trapped in the treasury sleeve for a while now.
It was all black in there. He did not know where he was or what
time it was until the old man let him out. He was thrown out onto
his backside.</p>
<p>The first thing he saw was the weird old man. He quickly looked
around. He was in a valley with lots of weird flowers and grass.
There was also a blue, babbling stream. Many animals were hanging
around there.</p>
<p>“You should eat this.” The strange old man collected two pieces
of fruit off a tree and tossed them to Han Sen. He accepted the
fruit and stared at the old man with a complex look. He did not
know if he should explain matters or not. After all, he did not
know what the old man wanted from the red-robed child. If he said
he was not the right person and the old man thought he was useless,
he could end up killing him. That would have been a poor
result.</p>
<p>Han Sen wasn’t going to explain. Instead, he asked, “Why did you
bring me here?”</p>
<p>“I captured you for treasure.” Holy Pirate was in a good mood.
He brought out the sky silk picture. He stared at it like he was
drunk.</p>
<p>“What treasure did you want?” Han Sen asked.</p>
<p>“This is the treasure,” Holy Pirate said as he looked at the
picture.</p>
<p>Han Sen looked at what he was referring to. He noticed it was a
painting. In the picture, there was a fairy with her clothes
floating. She was flying to cloud nine.</p>
