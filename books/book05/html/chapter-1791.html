<p>“Demon Grave?” Han Sen frowned and looked at Mister Ji.</p>
<p>Mister Ji nodded and said, “Yes, Demon Grave. It was an ordinary
xenogeneic space, but a battle once transpired there. Something
went awry. Anyone who enters there now has their powers suppressed
to the level of an ordinary bumpkin in geno armor. Even a King
would be like a commoner there, and the same applies to any
weaponry that enters.”</p>
<p>“There’s a place like that? What happened there?” Han Sen
asked.</p>
<p>“You have seen how powerful that Kong Fei is, yes? The one of
No,” Mister Ji inquired.</p>
<p>Han Sen had a front row seat for that particular show. He nodded
and said, “Yes, I have.”</p>
<p>“Demon Grave is the result of two elites like Kong Fei having a
brawl,” Mister Ji said. “It is useless to try and resist the
suppression of that zone. Your strength won’t mean squat there. You
will be a commoner when you enter. The strongest people that opt to
reside there are ones like you. It is true skill that sets them
apart. When you are there, you might find yourself able to kill a
King.”</p>
<p>“Why am I going to that place with you?” Han Sen frowned.</p>
<p>A place like that did indeed seem to be good for him, but Han
Sen didn’t think he was invincible enough to march in blindly.</p>
<p>The geno universe, in one way or another, had the Falsified-Sky
Sutra. Demon was not the strongest race, though, and that meant
there were powers out there that were even greater than it. Han Sen
did not think Mister Ji would be invincible if he went to this
place.</p>
<p>Furthermore, his power would be greatly suppressed. Death would
find him easier there, so that wasn’t good.</p>
<p>“The legends say two god elites fought for a treasure in
xenogeneic space, and that was how the place became Demon Grave. I
am unsure which of them might have managed to take this treasure,
but after their battle, there were many xenogeneic plants. The
fruit they bear is very mystic, and I will need just one of them. I
am hoping you will be able to go with me to retrieve it. If you aid
me in this venture, you will be highly rewarded,” Mister Ji said
seriously.</p>
<p>“If these fruits can provide such a big benefit, and they are
still there for the taking, this place must be quite dangerous,”
Han Sen said.</p>
<p>Mister Ji did not want to hide these facts. He picked up some
notes and then laid out everything he had gathered. “Demon Grave
has a lot of xenogeneic plants, but there are no xenogeneic
creatures there. Don’t worry. But inside the place, there is an
indigenous race. They are the lesser sort of race that can only
wear geno armor. None of them can become Nobles. Growing up there,
however, allows them to munch on as much of the xenogeneic fruit as
they want. They cannot become proper Barons, but their raw strength
is higher than the average soldier’s. They are roughly the equal of
an average Baron.”</p>
<p>Mister Ji went on to say, “If they are outside that place, it
matters little how strong they are. They are, for all intents and
purposes, rubbish. Inside Demon Grave, however, even a King might
lose to them. They are our biggest enemy to fear.”</p>
<p>Han Sen surveyed the information in front of him, and he found
that most of the papers were drawings that had been done by hand.
There weren’t any actual videos or surveillance photos.</p>
<p>“You cannot use tools in there. This is all we have, so take a
look,” Mister Ji explained.</p>
<p>Han Sen kept on looking at the pictures that had been drawn,
though, and he admired the artistic qualities.</p>
<p>The bodies of this race looked human-like, but they possessed
butterfly wings. Their hair grew upwards like fire, and their
bodies were like those of a human. They wore silver geno armor, and
they looked really nice.</p>
<p>The documents said they were called Chaos. They were not Nobles,
and nor were they xenogeneics. But their power could definitely be
compared to that of a Baron.</p>
<p>They were nothing when they were out in the world, but they were
scary inside their territory.</p>
<p>Chaos ate the xenogeneic fruit. While many others had ventured
there, hoping to collect some—even Dukes—they were mostly
killed.</p>
<p>But when Han Sen read the effects of those fruits, he was
tempted.</p>
<p>Han Sen had eighty-six Baron geno points, and that was because
he consistently ate the materials and weapons he found. He hadn’t
cooked the horn arrows or the Pirate Bone Sword. He did eat the
Toxic Fang Dagger, though. And after everything he’d consumed, he
was still a while away from one hundred.</p>
<p>He killed Greataxe Viscount, but there were no materials for him
to retrieve. He couldn’t get the dozen Baron geno points he
needed.</p>
<p>After seeing the description of the xenogeneic fruit, Han Sen
thought that maybe he’d be able to increase his own genes. If he
could, he’d become a Viscount.</p>
<p>But still, it depended on the fruit itself. And fruit aside,
there was already a fairly good motive that could prompt him to go
on this venture. If he was able to get a few of the fruits, he
could at least swap them for materials, too.</p>
<p>“Aside from the one I need, you can keep any others you collect.
If I get the fruit I want, I will give you a Viscount armor that
was forged from xenogeneic material. The defense of the gear is as
good as it gets.” When Mister Ji said this, Han Sen was
unbelievably tempted to join him.</p>
<p>Not only was it the prospect of Viscount armor, but being able
to keep collected fruit was wondrous, too. Han Sen really wanted to
go.</p>
<p>Mister Ji, seeing Han Sen not saying a word, still looked
hesitant. So, he took out his phone and showed Han Sen a visual of
the armor.</p>
<p>The armor was blue and made of scales. It looked like a
fish-scale armorset.</p>
<p>Mister Ji smiled and said, “This Viscount Armor is called
Aqua-Scale Armor. It is made from the scales of Viscount Aqua-
Scale Snakes. Each snake only has one scale, so it took 265 to make
this set.”</p>
<p>“If you think I’m worth all this, then sure. I will come with
you.” Han Sen smiled and agreed to the trip. He looked calm and
composed, but inwardly, he was drooling over the potential
rewards.</p>
<p>Two hundred and sixty-five Viscount materials was incredible.
Seeing the armor, Han Sen didn’t want to wear it. He wanted to eat
it That set of armor could take him from Baron to Viscount, and
from Viscount to Earl. That was not an armorset. That was a
recovery soup.</p>
