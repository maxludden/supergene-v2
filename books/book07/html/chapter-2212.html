<h2>Mutant Galactic Shrimp</h2>
<h3>Chapter 2212</h3>

<p>Night River King’s power wasn’t impressive when compared to
other Kings. That skill he was using now was very powerful, though.
As he fought, even the King class Galactic Lobsters were hurt by
the attacks he hurled. Sections of their shells were shattered by
the force, and the revealed flesh began to rot away
immediately.</p>
<p>“Night River King sure has some skill,” Han Sen thought to
himself. He kept moving around the battlefield, waiting for his
best chance to strike.</p>
<p>Due to Night River King not having explosive powers, Han Sen had
every chance to secure a final hit if he got the timing right. If
Han Sen had been following around another king, one that had
explosive powers, he wouldn’t have stood a chance. Explosive
attacks of King level would tear the lobster apart too quickly for
Han Sen to slip in a final blow.</p>
<p>“Xenogeneic Marquise Galactic Shrimp killed. Xenogeneic gene
found. Obtained Galactic Shrimp beast soul.”</p>
<p>Han Sen was relieved to have finally gotten a beast soul. “After
killing so many Galactic Shrimps, at least one was willing to yield
me something.”</p>
<p>Han Sen didn’t have the time to inspect the beast soul at that
moment, though. He had to focus his attention on the fight. He
didn’t want to stumble into danger while he was distracted.</p>
<p>He didn’t want to make use of his Demon Bug Bai Sema unless it
was necessary. His Ghost Teeth Knife was glowing a dark shade of
purple. Its knife airs, when unleashed, killed large numbers of
Galactic Shrimp. There were hordes of xenogeneics occupying that
parcel of space, though, so he wouldn’t be able to kill them
all.</p>
<p>While Han Sen watched things unfold, a Duke class Ice Blue
Knight was fighting a Galactic Shrimp. That Galactic Shrimp looked
a little stranger than the usual variety.</p>
<p>It definitely wasn’t a King class Galactic Lobster, but it was
bigger than a normal Galatic Shrimp, and it had a translucent blue
body. That soft blue glowed with the light of stars.</p>
<p>“A mutant xenogeneic?” Han Sen immediately focused on that
fight.</p>
<p>The Ice Blue Knight was strong. Every individual knight there
was powerful, but the one that was engaged with the mutant Galactic
Shrimp was one of the best Dukes there was. As he began fighting
the mutant Galactic Shrimp, he was able to get in a few early
hits.</p>
<p>But then the tables turned, and he was having a hard time
fighting the mutant Galactic Shrimp. It was plain to see that he
wasn’t winning the engagement.</p>
<p>Han Sen took a closer look at what was going on, and he noticed
that the Ice Blue Knight had abandoned the standard knight
formation in order to block the passage of the mutant Galactic
Shrimp. But he had done that specifically to draw the attention of
the mutant Galactic Shrimp, so its arrival wouldn’t ruin his entire
team’s formation.</p>
<p>The mutant Galactic Shrimp was strong, and its body carried a
galactic light. It was incredibly fast, and each of its strikes was
like a hammer blow. The Ice Blue Knight couldn’t evade its strikes.
He tried to use his shield to block the mutant Galactic Shrimp’s
attacks, but the shield was sundered by a single hit. The shrimp’s
spikes did not relent there, either, for after the cloven shield
was bypassed, it pierced through the Duke’s armor. Blood oozed out
of the point of entry.</p>
<p>The Ice Blue Knight let out a roar. He ignored his wounds as his
fists lit up with fires like a sun. They slammed down into the head
of the mutant Galactic Shrimp.</p>
<p>Katcha!</p>
<p>The Galactic Shrimp’s eye was punched inwards. The shell of the
creature was dented all over, which sent more of that glowing blue
blood squirting out of the punctures.</p>
<p>But it wasn’t dead just yet. It gathered itself and summoned a
green light, then flew at the Ice Blue Duke in a blur.</p>
<p>Blergh!</p>
<p>Ice Blue Duke coughed out blood. The armor on his chest was
shattered. The shrimp’s spike had rammed straight through his
chest, leaving him impaled.</p>
<p>Suddenly, a dark purple knife air appeared near the mutant
Galactic Shrimp. The knife air moved with the ferocity of a dragon,
drilling into the Galactic Shrimp’s already-wounded head. The
creature squealed in pain.</p>
<p>Han Sen pushed the Ice Blue Knight off of the wretched spike and
used his Ghost Teeth Knife to produce knife silks. He guided the
silks to begin killing all the Marquise Galactic Shrimp that were
closing in on them.</p>
<p>“I’m fine.” The Ice Blue Knight struggled to straighten himself
back up. His chest and back were bleeding, and more blood began to
drip from the corner of his mouth. But even so, he was already back
up and wading into the fight.</p>
<p>His body was on fire, and his fists were like suns. He threw
more punches at the mutant Galactic Shrimp.</p>
<p>“Crap! You’re badly injured, and you still want to fight it?”
Han Sen didn’t dare slow down as he mused, though. He kept swinging
his Ghost Teeth Knife, determined to get the last hit no matter
what.</p>
<p>That Ice Blue Knight looked like a red bear. He was
three-meters-tall, and he possessed a disturbing amount of
strength. The power he summoned looked like a raging fire, and each
punch was like an entire sun exploding. His attacks really did
leave Han Sen speechless.</p>
<p>If he hadn’t punched open the mutant Galactic Shrimp’s shell
already, Han Sen wouldn’t have been able to pierce through it like
he had.</p>
<p>The fiery Ice Blue Knight was back to fighting the mutant
Galactic Shrimp, though. Han Sen was fast, and he kept circling and
attacking at the same time. He could slow their foe down and make
the Ice Blue Knight’s fight a bit easier for him.</p>
<p>Pang! Pang!</p>
<p>Han Sen hovered in the air, casting his petrification shockwave.
It petrified all the lesser Galactic Shrimp in the area, but it
didn’t do very much to the mutant one. The attempted petrification
only slowed it down a bit.</p>
<p>Han Sen was clutching his Ghost Teeth Knife, and he summoned his
Spell rocket launcher. He fired a rocket that hit the mutant
Galactic Shrimp, resulting in a mushroom cloud explosion. The
Galactic Shrimp was marked with the symbol of a turtle, too. That
definitely slowed the beast down.</p>
<p>But in that universe, Turtle didn’t do much to a creature that
was flying.</p>
<p>Even so, Han Sen’s petrification and Turtle rocket attacks made
the fight a lot easier for the Duke. The Ice Blue Knight was no
longer struggling beneath the pressure as he had been earlier, and
that was because the mutant Galactic Shrimp had become discernibly
slower.</p>
<p>The fiery Ice Blue Knight roared and threw another punch, which
hit the creature’s largest wound like an atom bomb. It blew half of
the mutant Galactic Shrimp’s head clean off. The blue flesh below
was scorched and smoldering with a red, ravaging flame.</p>
<p>“Please don’t die! Save your last breath for me,” Han Sen
prayed. He was afraid that the Ice Blue Knight would finish the
shrimp off. He flew forward, intentionally crossing the Ice Blue
Knight’s path to block him. Then he fired a rocket at the mutant
Galactic Shrimp.</p>
<p>It carried the Break Six Skies powers, delivering them directly
to the exposed brain of the severely-wounded head. The rocket
exploded and dealt heavy damage to the foe.</p>
<p>But the next second, the mutant Galactic Shrimp glowed green.
Its body began to swell, expanding like a supernova. Its green
light covered everything within a radius of one mile and destroyed
everything within that distance.</p>
<p>Fortunately, Han Sen and the Ice Blue Knight were far away from
that self-exploding mutant Galactic Shrimp. They had fled as
quickly as they could, and thereby avoided the harm dealt by that
explosion.</p>
