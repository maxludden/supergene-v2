<p>“I am finally back! Home is good.” Han Sen returned home. He
took a deep breath and accepted the heartwarming fragrance of
home.</p>
<p>“Dad!” Upon seeing Han Sen, Ling’er ran over to him in search of
a hug.</p>
<p>“Ling’er. Good Ling’er. Let Dad kiss you.” Han Sen picked up
Ling’er and kissed her on the head. He rubbed her face and
commented on how spongey her cheeks felt.</p>
<p>“You remembered to come back. If you were not yet back, Ling’er
was going to forget what you looked like.” Ji Yanran rolled her
eyes at Han Sen.</p>
<p>Han Sen picked up Ling’er. He used his nose to rub hers as he
said, “Ling’er would not forget Dad. Isn’t that right?”</p>
<p>Ling’er’s eyes were wide open as she replied, “Ling’er would
never forget Dad, and Dad would never forget Ling’er. Right?” Han
Sen held Ling’er and said, “Of course not. Ling’er is daddy’s baby.
Daddy can forget everyone except for Ling’er,” Ling’er was holding
Han Sen’s neck. With a squeaky voice, she asked, “Ling’er and Daddy
will be together forever, right?”</p>
<p>“Of course.” Han Sen nodded.</p>
<p>“Kindergarten is on a break. Mother said Ling’er can go play.”
Ling’er blinked and asked, “Can you take me to the big universe to
play?”</p>
<p>“What?” Han Sen was surprised. It was now revealed that she was
being so nice solely for the reason of Han Sen taking her out.</p>
<p>Han Sen sighed. If this was before, he would have hesitated and
outright refused to take Ling’er to the big universe. It was too
dangerous.</p>
<p>Now, Han Sen had the power to protect himself, so he had the
option to consider it.</p>
<p>“If there is no danger, you should take her,” said Ji Yanran,
who was nearby. “The teacher gave her a lot of homework that
requires the assistance of a parent. You never spend time with her.
Take this as a trip to finish the homework.”</p>
<p>“Why not? Out there, I have a place to stay. Bao’er and Little
Red Bird are there. I bet they miss Ling’er a lot.” Han Sen nodded.
He looked at Ji Yanran and asked, “Are you coming with</p>
<p>us?!</p>
<p>“I am not going,” Ji Yanran said. “Recently, I have been
researching Xuanmen skills. I have discovered something
interesting. I want to achieve something with the Xuanmen skills
first, then I will take Ling’er to the universe. I will be living
there from now on.”</p>
<p>Han Sen was surprised. Xuanmen skills were a bit complicated and
more than a bit boring. It was difficult for ordinary people to
learn, and the results were never obvious. It was a skill that took
a long time to learn. He was surprised to hear that Ji Yanran was
interested in learning a Xuanmen skill.</p>
<p>The next morning, Han Sen took Ling’er with him on his
teleportation back to the universe. He said goodbye to Kong Fei and
used Galaxy Teleportation to return to Space Garden.</p>
<p>Ling’er was very good at adjusting. The universe’s powerful
pressure did not affect her. She was able to adjust to its
environment pretty quickly. It was surprising. “How powerful is
Ling’er’s body? When I just leveled up and came here, it took me a
while to adjust to the pressure of this universe.” Han Sen looked
at Ling’er with a strange expression. She was merrily jumping
around. Her two pigtails were swinging.</p>
<p>Han Sen was feeling cocky and said, “I cannot blame her. After
all, her daddy is the one-and-only Han Sen.”</p>
<p>The Holy Baby was released by Han Sen again. With a look of
depression, he waddled over to sit next to him.</p>
<p>There were not many changes in Space Garden, but there were many
changes in the people there. Bao’er, Little Red Bird, Little Angel,
Zero, Huangfu Jing, Qin Xuan, Tang Zhenliu, and Wang Yuhang were
all there.</p>
<p>Most importantly, many people had already used the resources of
Space Garden to become deified class. Aside from the few that
showed up on the geno god list, Moment Queen and Little Star Star
were deified too.</p>
<p>“This is all because of Little Red Bird,” Wang Yuhang excitedly
said. “If it was not for him, we would not be able to start hunting
plant xenogeneics so fast. We would not have as much geno fluid to
use. By the way, this is such a great place. Deified xenogeneic
plants are all over the place.”</p>
<p>Bao’er pulled Ling’er away to play elsewhere. Little Red Bird
shook its butt and followed from behind. After following them for a
bit, it went back. It flapped its wings and flew around Han Sen. It
circled him a few times. It kept looking at him. It seemed as if he
was searching for something.</p>
<p>“Are you looking for this?” Han Sen’s heart jumped. He brought
out the metal egg that Tai Yi had given to him.</p>
<p>Little Red Bird was excited and screamed. It flew over to Han
Sen and opened its mouth, obviously wanting to eat the metal
egg.</p>
<p>“I cannot give this to you yet.” Han Sen smiled and put the egg
back. Little Red Bird was disappointed.</p>
<p>He was not going to allow Little Red Bird to gobble it up before
he figured out what the little metal egg did.</p>
<p>Space Garden was not very big right. They were mostly human
creatures and spirits there. Their powers were not bad.</p>
<p>Han Sen thought, “It looks like we can bring more interesting
guys here. Space Garden has so many resources now. I can bring a
few hundred more people and we’ll still be fine.”</p>
<p>The next place Han Sen planned on going to was the realm of the
Buddha. He was still hesitant about choosing whether or not to
challenge the Buddha and knock them down from being one of the
higher races or just going to their lands and stealing the knife
back.</p>
<p>Taking down the Buddha was the best choice, but Han Sen did not
want to do it as a human. If he used his crystallizer’s name, he
did not know if humans would benefit from the act.</p>
<p>Ordinarily, after a race’s lantern was lit, the creatures of the
same race would receive a buff via the lantern. The genes in their
bodies increased.</p>
<p>Han Sen and the others were not pure crystallizers. If he used
the name of the crystallizers to light up a lantern, he did not
know what the outcome might be.</p>
<p>“So far, the name of the crystallizers to light up the lantern
might yield better results,” Wang Yuhang said. “Things about humans
should not be too obvious. Plus, the ranking of the Buddha is low.
It is not worth risking humans to take.”</p>
<p>Everyone thought using the name of the crystallizers to fight
the Buddha was better. After seeing the geno god list, they knew
their powers were much weaker than others in the universe. It was
not enough for them to keep a grip on their throne. “Alright.” Han
Sen nodded. He planned on using Dollar’s identity for humans to
light up a lantern. To do that, he was not going to select a
low-tier race to target. He was going to make sure that when the
humans were ready to make themselves known to the universe, they
would immediately get into the top five.</p>
<p>Xi Qing King, Qin Xuan, and Han Sen were talking about the
details. They confirmed that they would take down the Buddha as
crystallizers and replace the lantern.</p>
<p>“Bao’er, you take good care of Ling’er. Dad has some things to
do.” Han Sen gave Ling’er to Bao’er. He used Galaxy Teleportation
to go where the Buddha were.</p>
<p>Upon seeing Han Sen leave, Holy Baby looked very happy and had a
murderous expression. He walked over to Bao’er and Ling’er, who
were playing together.</p>
