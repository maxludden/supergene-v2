<p>Mountain. River. Sun. Moon. Knife. Axe. Sword. Spear. The holy
air came out again, all headed towards Han Sen. They entered
through his forehead, one after another.</p>
<p>“Good Bao’er! I raised you well, after all.” Han Sen was so
happy, he wanted to pick her up and kiss her cheeks.</p>
<p>One holy air headed for Han Sen was like the mountain of a god.
Han Sen felt the power of a mountain go inside him.</p>
<p>Han Sen felt as if he himself had become the god mountain. The
strength, vitality, and power of a mountain were inside him. He now
understood what a mountain truly was.</p>
<p>A river came next, and Han Sen became a river in accordance. The
swell of the river, and the infinite reach of its waters came into
Han Sen’s heart. At that moment, Han Sen was the river, and the
river was Han Sen.</p>
<p>Galaxy and snow. All these strange things landed atop Han Sen.
He understood everything at a greater level than he had before.</p>
<p>A myriad of experiences flowed into Han Sen. His world was a
fish. It was a tiger. It was a bug. It was a dragon. His world had
been turned upside-down, and he saw the world from a different
point-of-view. It was something that he should not have
understood.</p>
<p>These weren’t just feelings; the holy air cleaned his body. He
could understand other things more. Now Han Sen knew why, after the
holy gourd sword air, the sword skills would increase.</p>
<p>After learning the essence of the sword, with the body cleansed,
the sword skill talents would increase.</p>
<p>Ten thousand gourd holy airs were coming. To someone like Han
Sen, who already knew everything, it was a magnificent boon.</p>
<p>Holy gourd airs did not increase one’s level or power, but the
benefits they gave weren’t something you could get by leveling up,
anyway.</p>
<p>“How…?” The Sky Palace leader and all the elders were stunned
again. Even the deified ones could not find the means to shut their
mouths.</p>
<p>“Damn! The holy vine’s holy airs can be requested? I thought
nothing could influence whether or not they were bestowed on
someone. What is going on now?”</p>
<p>“Is everything I have come to know a lie? The gourd doesn’t need
to approve of who it gives its holy airs to?”</p>
<p>“Fuck! I thought the holy gourd air was something noble. It
turns out to be something quite cheap.”</p>
<p>“F*ck you! This favoritism is too much. Han Sen’s daughter can
get holy air, and then ask the same to be given to her father? This
has to be a joke!”</p>
<p>“Does walking Sky Road require social connections now?”</p>
<p>“Making a good baby is better than living well, it would seem.
Make a good daughter, and you can have everything.” “There is no
need for the Sky Road anymore. It sucks.”</p>
<p>The elders were silent. They could not understand why the vine
would accept Bao’er’s request. It was unbelievable. Not even the
deified elites could get a holy air without the vine’s
approval.</p>
<p>Bao’er had casually spoken her wish, but the vine released
plenty of holy airs from its gourds. It made all the elders wonder
about the meaning of their existence. Perhaps the gourd had been
gathering up its holy airs for millions of years, and now it was
randomly spewing them out to the lucky.</p>
<p>But deep down, they knew that wasn’t true. Many people had
walked across Sky Road, and only a very few ever gained the
approval of the gourds.</p>
<p>“I want this student. Whoever fights me on this will no longer
be my friend.” The fourth-eat elder sounded angry.</p>
<p>“What do you mean? This girl is my student. We look so similar,
after all.” The elders started to argue amongst themselves
again.</p>
<p>That was a sleepless night for the Sky. Two people had received
ten thousand holy airs in one day. The most unbelievable thing was
that one set had been given upon request.</p>
<p>After that day, many Sky Palace students re-walked the Sky Road.
They hoped a miracle would occur for them, but nothing ever did.
There was no reaction from the gourds, even if they walked across
it a few times. They never got approved.</p>
<p>Some students begged it, hoping to touch the holy vine and have
it give them its holy airs. They burned so many sacrifices, and
they kowtowed until their foreheads were bloody. But no matter what
they tried, the gourd vine was unmoved.</p>
<p>Now people knew that begging for holy air depended on who you
were. Not just anyone could do that.</p>
<p>After that, Bao’er was bestowed the title of Little Fairy. She
didn’t look like Han Sen’s daughter, and she looked more like a
fairy due to her having ten thousand gourd holy airs.</p>
<p>Han Sen also experienced the winds of ten thousand gourd airs,
and when all was done, he felt amazing. When he looked at things’
he saw them a whole different way now.</p>
<p>Four hours later, all the holy airs had successfully blended
into Han Sen’s body. The gourds looked exhausted when they were
finished.</p>
<p>Thanks,” Han Sen said to the gourds. Then, he picked up Bao’er
and walked to the main island.</p>
<p>The Road to the Sky did nothing to Bao’er. Nothing strange
happened there. Han Sen held Bao’er and carried her into Sky Palace
safely.</p>
<p>The students of Sky Palace looked at Han Sen as if he was a
stranger. It was as if they thought he was a monster that had
escaped from the zoo.</p>
<p>Before Han Sen had a chance to go to the leader and elders with
Bao’er himself, they came running towards him.</p>
<p>“Han Sen; I am going to take your daughter as a student. You may
have whatever you wish.”</p>
<p>“No, she is my student! Han Sen, I have so many weapons you can
choose from. You can take any you wish, if you allow your daughter
to be a student of mine.”</p>
<p>“What is the point of giving out so many weapons? Come to my
Medicine King Island. All the medicines and geno fluids there are
now yours.” “I… I…”</p>
<p>“Enough! Look at what you people have become. Do any of you
still respect me? Act like the elders you are!” the Sky Palace
leader roared, slamming his fist into the table.</p>
<p>All the elders looked ashamed of themselves. The leader walked
in front of Han Sen. “Han Sen, you know Lone Bamboo. You know how
strong he is. If you allow Bao’er to become his student, with my
teachings as well, she can become something great.”</p>
<p>“Obscene.” The elders became even angrier. They started to fight
again.</p>
