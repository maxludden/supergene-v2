    <p>
      Han Sen wanted to take back Mad Shield, but the sword of the girl was too
      fast indeed. Before he took Mad Shield back, another flash flew across.
    </p>

    <p>Crack!</p>

    <p>
      This time, the tower shield was cut in half for real. The slim sword cut
      to the tall figure of Mad Shield like a lightning bolt. With a flash,
      there was a line added to the body of Mad Shield.
    </p>

    <p>Boom!</p>

    <p>
      The body of Mad Shield fell into two halves. The spirit was killed like
      that.
    </p>

    <p>
      Not having any time to regret the loss of the aristocrat spirit that he
      had gained not long ago, Han Sen ran toward the statue at full speed.
    </p>

    <p>
      Treading Cloud, Han Sen had eventually put the footwork into use. Running
      like wind, Han Sen rushed to the statute like a tornado.
    </p>

    <p>
      However, the silver-haired girl was not slower than him at all, but even
      faster. Catching up with him momentarily, she stepped her sword at Han
      Sen&#8217;s back.
    </p>

    <p>
      Without turning back, a golden worm covered in red armor appeared behind
      Han Sen, blocking the girl&#8217;s sword, while Han Sen jumped up and
      spread the nightmare wings, throwing himself at the sparkling spirit stone
      between the statue&#8217;s brows.
    </p>

    <p>Ding ding ding!</p>

    <p>
      The three strikes cut the golden rock worm king consecutively, and the red
      armor was cut deeply. Even the shell of the worm king was broken. Golden
      blood started to flow.
    </p>

    <p>
      Luckily, the pet armor that had become a berserk super beast soul was much
      harder than the tower shield, so the golden rock worm king was not killed
      after taking three strikes.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen took back the golden rock worm king. The spirit stone was right in
      front of him. Even if the silver-haired girl came at this moment, there
      was no time for her to stop him from taking the stone.
    </p>

    <p>
      However, when Han Sen&#8217;s fingers were about to touch the spirit
      stone, he suddenly felt a strong anxiety. His back was covered in cold
      sweat.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Something&#8217;s wrongâ€¦&#8221; As Han Sen felt that, he saw a
      golden figure coming from behind the giant head of the statue. At the same
      time, a gold sword went to Han Sen&#8217;s chest.
    </p>

    <p>
      That sword was so fast and Han Sen was so close that there was no time for
      him to dodge.
    </p>

    <p>Whoosh!</p>

    <p>
      The golden sword pierced the golden armor into his chest. Han Sen then saw
      the person who stabbed him. It was a girl with wavy blonde hair and golden
      eyes covered in golden armor, holding a golden slim sword.
    </p>

    <p>
      Except for the fact that everything was golden on her body, the girl
      looked almost identical to the silver-haired girl. They were almost like
      two dolls made from the same mold, only with different colors of their
      armor and hair.
    </p>

    <p>&#8220;Boom!&#8221;</p>

    <p>
      The blonde girl kicked Han Sen down to the floor. Han Sen fell hard and
      saw that on the back of the statue there was another face. The statue was
      two-faced, and between the eyebrows of the face in the back, there was
      another spirit stone, which was golden and shiny.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Twin spirits?&#8221; Han Sen eventually understood why the
      silver-haired girl would be so relaxed to fight Han Sen alone, not asking
      the creatures to hit him.
    </p>

    <p>
      Because that was unnecessary. The spirit shelter was in fact a rare double
      spirit shelter. In addition to the silver-haired girl, there was a
      similarly good blonde girl.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen could not even get rid of the silver-haired girl, let alone two
      girls.
    </p>

    <p>
      Without any hesitation, the moment when Han Sen fell to the ground, he got
      up and brushed toward the outside. Motivating his body and cracking his
      bones, Han Sen pushed his potentials to his limit.
    </p>

    <p>
      The silver-haired girl and blonde girl did not mean to let him go. The two
      beautiful but deadly figures rushed toward Han Sen like to lightning
      bolts.
    </p>

    <p>
      Blood spilled like rain. Han Sen had used the kiting skills to his limit.
      However, all he could do was to avoid his vital parts. The silver and
      golden slim sword continued to leave one injury after another on his body.
    </p>

    <p>
      The sword skills of the blonde girl and silver-haired girl were
      compatible. They complement each other and were much stronger when used
      alone. Han Sen did not even want to fight anymore. He had miscalculated
      from the very beginning, so he did not have a chance to win again. All he
      could do was to go out as fast as he could in order to survive.
    </p>

    <p>
      With blood covering his body, Han Sen was extremely lucid. His eyes cold,
      he quickly calculated every possibly as fast as he could. Han Sen only had
      one goal. Under the attack of both royal spirit&#8217;s, he did not any
      chance to get the spirit stone again.
    </p>

    <p>
      Every step he made was traded with his injury. Every step was carefully
      designed, but it could not save him from being hurt.
    </p>

    <p>
      At this point, Han Sen had no other ways than trading injuries for his
      life. When he reached at the stone gate, he was covered in a lot of blood
      already.
    </p>

    <p>
      At this point, Han Sen could only celebrate the fact that he had both the
      armor and the glyph. Otherwise, even if he had practiced Jadeskin, he
      would have died a million times.
    </p>

    <p>
      The effect of the armor and glyph blocked the majority of the force on the
      swords of the girls. When the swords hit him, the remaining force was less
      than 30%, only leaving shallow marks on him.
    </p>

    <p>
      Although they seemed scary, they were not deadly, allowing Han Sen to
      fight again.
    </p>

    <p>
      However, outside the architecture were full of all kinds of creatures
      including sacred-blood creatures like the black snake, looking even more
      scary than hell.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen no longer had other options. If he could go out, he could survive.
      Those sacred-blood creatures were still inferior to the girls. In
      addition, they were less intelligent, which was Han Sen&#8217;s
      opportunity.
    </p>

    <p>Boom!</p>

    <p>
      With all kinds of scary creatures at the door, Han Sen did not cringe but
      rushed into them, thanks to his armor.
    </p>

    <p>
      The flying bull fiercely threw itself at Han Sen, charging Han Sen with
      its horns. However, the next second, a huge golden creature fell from the
      sky, smashing all the creatures nearby.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Rush out!&#8221; Han Sen threw himself onto the back of the golden
      growler which was the size of a hill and roared, grabbing his hair.
    </p>

    <p>
      The golden growler route and ran into the group of creatures like crazy,
      getting rid of the creatures and marching toward the main gate.
