<h2>Silver Sycee</h2>
<h3>Chapter 2270</h3>

<p>The steel twig was unexpectedly tough. It took Han Sen a long
while to cut through it so he could claim the silver fruit for
himself.</p>
<p>When he finally sawed through the twig, the silver fruit dropped
from the tree. Han Sen reached out his hand to grab it. But the
moment the silver sycee touched his hand, Han Sen’s eyes
widened.</p>
<p>His face twisted, and his muscles trembled and shook. His blood
surged through his veins like lightning, and his entire body turned
to ice jade. He roared. He struggled to raise the hand that was
holding the silver sycee, his other hand clutching his waist as if
he was about to have a hernia.</p>
<p>Han Sen summoned all the power he could. His hair flew around
like mad, and green veins bulged across his head.</p>
<p>Patong!</p>
<p>The silver sycee continued to fall to the ground, taking Han
Sen’s hand with it. Han Sen had to half-kneel on the ground.</p>
<p>“What kind of fruit is this? It is so heavy! If I swallowed
this, it would tear straight through my stomach!” Han Sen stared at
the fruit in disbelief. He wanted to get his hand out from under
it, but it was pinning his hand down. He pulled away with all his
might, but the fruit wouldn’t budge.</p>
<p>Han Sen took out his knife and hacked away at the silver fruit.
The loud shrieking noise of metal on metal assaulted his ears, but
the sycee remained completely undamaged. The fruit was harder than
the tree it had come from.</p>
<p>After a moment of thought, Han Sen decided to dig into the
ground instead. The floor of the palace was also incredibly hard,
though. Han Sen’s cuts only left light scrape marks behind.</p>
<p>The blood kirin used its own claws to help dig through the stone
near Han Sen’s hand. The creature actually managed to leave a few
proper scratch marks, but whenever it pulled its claws away, the
scratch marks would disappear.</p>
<p>The blood kirin kept digging, but the floor continued to
miraculously recover. Han Sen’s hand remained motionless under the
silver sycee.</p>
<p>“Grab that fruit and lift it away!” Han Sen barked to the blood
kirin when he realized that digging into the floor was a futile
endeavor.</p>
<p>The blood kirin, upon hearing Han Sen, locked its jaws around
the silver sycee. It yanked upward with all of its might, but the
silver sycee remained still.</p>
<p>“What… what is this thing…” Han Sen was frozen. It was just a
fruit, but not even a half-deified being could move it. The sycee
didn’t even twitch.</p>
<p>Even more strangely, Han Sen’s hand hadn’t been crushed. The
sycee was keeping him pinned in place, but if the fruit was really
as heavy as it seemed, his hand should have been crushed and
broken.</p>
<p>In truth, his hand was only suffering a bit of pressure. It
definitely hadn’t been injured.</p>
<p>Just as Han Sen was about to use Purple-Eye Butterfly to take a
look at the fruit, the teleporter rippled with movement. Someone
was coming.</p>
<p>Han Sen looked over as Mister White and Crime emerged. Their
presence made him frown.</p>
<p>Although Crime was King class instead of half-deified, Han Sen
had witnessed his talents in battle. He was no worse than the
half-deified Edward, by Han Sen’s estimation.</p>
<p>“Han Sen, what are you doing?” Mister White looked at Han Sen
with interest.</p>
<p>The blood kirin interrupted his question with a roar. Then, it
leaped towards Mister White and Crime. Its claws wielded a blood
air as they slashed as Mister White like blades.</p>
<p>Mister White stepped forward like he was teleporting. He
appeared right beside the blood kirin and pressed a hand against
the creature’s head.</p>
<p>Mister White’s hand flashed with a strange symbol. That symbol
sank into the scaled forehead of the blood kirin like a brand.</p>
<p>Boom!</p>
<p>The blood kirin’s body suddenly became heavier, and the
increased weight almost took the creature to its knees.</p>
<p>The symbol glowed gently from the creature’s forehead, and the
blood kirin seemed to struggle against the encumbrance.</p>
<p>The blood kirin roared and jumped towards Mister White again,
but this time, it was far slower. Mister White moved with eerie
grace, and every step looked like he was teleporting. His power was
similar to Huangfu Jing’s. He was far stronger than her, of
course.</p>
<p>The blood kirin continued to chase Mister White, all the while
roaring in rage. It was angry at being tricked, and even more
furious that it was unable to bring harm to Mister White. Mister
White had played it for a fool.</p>
<p>“The blood kirin’s intelligence really is quite low.” Han Sen
sighed. The beast had plenty of brawn, but it was severely lacking
in the brains department.</p>
<p>Mister White lured the blood kirin to a side hall, and Han Sen
could do nothing to stop him. Meanwhile, Crime headed for the
pinned-down Han Sen. He looked at Han Sen and said, “We have no
grudge with you. Give me the stone plate, and we will leave. We
will pretend we did not see you.”</p>
<p>“Come and get it, if you have what it takes,” Han Sen replied
flatly.</p>
<p>“You are strong, but regrettably, the fruit seems to be holding
you in place quite easily. You can’t escape as you are right now.
How do you expect to fight me?” Crime drew his knife.</p>
<p>They had paid the price of underestimating Han Sen before, but
now, Crime considered him to be an equal opponent. Crime and Mister
White were not going to underestimate him anymore because he was a
Duke. Even though Han Sen’s hand was held firmly in place, which
left him unable to run, Crime was still going to use all his power
when he attacked.</p>
<p>Crime’s knife was very creepy, although it was only one foot
long. It was made of black metal, and the blade was shorter than
the handle. It looked like the blade had been broken.</p>
<p>A ring protruded from the base of the handle, and a chain was
attached firmly to the ring. The other end of the chain connected
to Crime’s strong arm.</p>
<p>As Crime slashed toward him, Han Sen didn’t speak. He simply
tapped the bird’s nest on his head, and it widened to shield Han
Sen’s entire body.</p>
<p>The bird’s nest caught Crime’s strike and reflected it in
complete silence. No sound was heard, and the nest remained
perfectly intact.</p>
<p>Crime was surprised. He gathered up all his power and slashed a
few more times. Nothing he tried seemed to work, though.</p>
<p>Han Sen wasn’t worried that Crime would break the bird’s nest.
Even Fox Queen hadn’t been able to damage that thing. There was no
way Crime could do what she could not.</p>
<p>It was a shame the bird’s nest couldn’t be used offensively.
However, he was currently more frustrated by his inability to get
the fruit off of his hand.</p>
<p>Han Sen tried a few different powers, but nothing seemed to
work. Aside from using his super god spirit body, he didn’t seem to
have many options.</p>
<p>Suddenly, Mister White’s voice came from the side hall. “Han
Sen, if things continue like this, none of us will benefit. Why
don’t we try to cooperate?”</p>
<p>“What do you suggest?” Han Sen asked after a moment.</p>
<p>“Make this blood kirin stop, firstly. At least then we might be
able to talk,” Mister White said.</p>
<p>“Okay.” Han Sen called the blood kirin back to his side. Mister
White also removed the mark he had placed upon the creature’s
forehead.</p>
<p>“How about this: I’ll help you escape, and in return, you’ll
give me the stone plate,” Mister White said while looking at Han
Sen.</p>
