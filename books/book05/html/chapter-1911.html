<p>Han Sen’s body could not move, and despite the fact that he
still had control over his senses, he couldn’t tell what element
the green light was. He wasn’t in a rush, though. The xenogeneic’s
power was amazing, but at the end of the day, it was only a
Viscount. Han Sen had Marquise armor on, and that meant he had no
reason to be afraid.</p>
<p>Plus, he had his super king spirit body to rely on. All things
considered, Han Sen was feeling pretty secure.</p>
<p>When the centipede approached, Han Sen noticed that it was
skittering around small orchid-like plants. There were no flowers
atop them, but small shapes like gold rats grew from them.</p>
<p>No, they weren’t rats. After a good look, Han Sen noticed it was
something quite familiar. The things growing on the plants were
very small Red Mist Minks.</p>
<p>There were seven of them, and their eyes all looked so big. They
looked very spiritual, but even so, they all vibrated together in
fear. Because their tails were grown into the plants, they could
not run. They all looked so scared as they stared at the
centipede.</p>
<p>Now, Han Sen knew that the centipede had come for the red mist
spring. It had come for the minks. What Han Sen didn’t know was who
the creature was going to attack first.</p>
<p>The centipede quickly skittered up to Han Sen with its
blade-like claws. It attacked Han Sen, making repeated ding dong
noises. The claws were unable to break Han Sen’s armor, but they
left marks on its surface. That was very impressive for a Viscount
class pair of claws.</p>
<p>The Viscount xenogeneic should have found it impossible to
damage a Marquise armor.</p>
<p>This xenogeneic is a bit creepy.” But even so, Han Sen still
felt safe. It was creepy, yes, but it could not harm him.</p>
<p>The centipede wreathed itself around Han Sen, trapping him in
the grip of its body. Its feet were also like blades, and they kept
scrabbling against him.</p>
<p>Fortunately, only a few white scratch marks were left on the
armor. The attacks still couldn’t damage him.</p>
<p>The creature did not have a mouth, and its head was very flat.
It had two long beard-strands, too. Aside from the claws and the
blade-like legs, there was no other way for it to attack Han
Sen.</p>
<p>It kept slashing Han Sen for quite some time, but it was unable
to hurt him. The centipede eventually gave up. It climbed over to
the plants that were growing minks, instead.</p>
<p>It circled the minks, but it did not seem to hurt them.</p>
<p>But the minks were still frightened. They were shaking in
fear.</p>
<p>“What is it trying to do?” Han Sen was confused, and so he
resumed trying to break through the green light.</p>
<p>Jadeskin, his mutant blood, and The Story of Genes were all
useless. When he cast his Dongxuan Sutra, he could sense something
from the light. But it was just Baron class, and one level lower
than the green light. He could not get it to break through.</p>
<p>Han Sen kept using his Dongxuan Sutra to battle the green light.
He also watched the xenogeneic. He was interested in learning what
it was up to.</p>
<p>As he fought the green light, Dongxuan Sutra’s power flowed
through him like it always did. But Han Sen felt as if the power
was changing slightly. He felt as if he was on the precipice of
breaking through.</p>
<p>Han Sen was so happy about this, seeing as he had used the
Dongxuan Sutra to fight against the green light. He wanted the
green light to sharpen the Dongxuan Sutra, and perhaps prompt a
level-up.</p>
<p>Right now, the most effective thing about the Dongxuan Sutra was
the Dongxuan Aura. Han Sen did not have the power to unleash
Dongxuan Sutra-fueled skills. If he made it reach Viscount, he
could cast attacks with the Dongxuan Sutra. Han Sen had been
waiting for this moment for a very long time.</p>
<p>Han Sen kept using his Dongxuan Sutra to fight the green light,
but it was one level lower. The power was being used up very
quickly.</p>
<p>Han Sen could only take very minor breaks. Whenever he regained
some of his power, he’d get right back into fighting.</p>
<p>After two hours of this, the cave was shining with red light.
Some of the mist had drifted into the cave like a river. The entire
cave was full of this red mist now.</p>
<p>As Han Sen wondered why the red mist was coming in, he realized
that the red mist in the cave had begun reducing.</p>
<p>The red mist was flowing as if it was being blown away by a fan.
It didn’t exit the cave, though. So, Han Sen had a peep at where
the red mist was going. It was seeping into the plants with the red
minks.</p>
<p>After half an hour, the red mist had become very thin. It no
longer hindered Han Sen’s senses.</p>
<p>The plants that absorbed the mist were releasing a light.
Especially the seven small minks. They looked so shiny, like little
treasures. They looked very golden.</p>
<p>After the mist was absorbed by the plants, no more mist entered
the cave. The shiny look on the plants and the minks began to
dull.</p>
<p>Han Sen took a closer look, and he noticed that the fur of the
minks was much fuller. Their eyes were brighter, too, and their
lifeforce had grown stronger.</p>
<p>“That centipede must be waiting for the minks to grow. I wonder
how much longer this might take?” Now Han Sen knew just what that
xenogeneic wanted.</p>
<p>Han Sen kept using the Dongxuan Sutra to battle the green light.
Every time Han Sen used up all his power in combat with the green
light, his powers grew stronger as they recovered. It was a process
that delighted him.</p>
<p>After a while, the mist entered the cave again. Just like last
time, the plants absorbed it. And then, the minks grew bigger.</p>
<p>The third time the mist was absorbed, the mist was absorbed by
the Red Mist Minks themselves. Han Sen’s body then moved. He
lowered his Ghost Teeth Knife, which he had been holding in the
air.</p>
<p>Han Sen could not break through the binding of the green light,
but the Dongxuan Sutra’s power was starting to work. And he knew
this because he could now move his body a minute amount.</p>
<p>The centipede sensed his movement, though. It turned around and
shone many of its eyes at Han Sen. It increased the power of the
chains it had locked around Han Sen, prohibiting him from moving
any more.</p>
<p>The xenogeneic had not been able to hurt Han Sen, and he didn’t
consider it much of a threat. So, Han Sen kept using the green
light to practice with the Dongxuan Sutra. And over time, he
developed a resistance to the green light.</p>
<p>On the twenty-third time the mist started pouring into the cave,
the plants’ light was growing again. They were becoming brighter
than the red mist. Amidst that heavy fog, the outlines of the
plants were visible, shining brightly. The seven plants each had a
Red Mist Mink growing on them.</p>
