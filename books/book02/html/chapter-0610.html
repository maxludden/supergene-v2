    <p>
      The creatures on the island were no longer intent on fighting each other.
      They each exerted all the strength they had in running up the hill to grab
      the seeds before the others could. The peacock was the closest, and with
      its boon of flight, spared no time in soaring there.
    </p>

    <p>
      Although Han Sen really wanted to grab the lotus, he was slowed down by
      his need to prevent the silver fox from going out on its own. He missed
      his chance and was too late.
    </p>

    <p>
      As the peacock was about to peck and gobble the lotus plant, one blood
      crystal lotus seed appeared to crack open.
    </p>

    <p>
      More accurately, it looked as if the blood crystals were beginning to
      sprout two translucent wings, as thin as a cicada&#8217;s. The wings
      started to flap, and they began flying away from the lotus cup.
    </p>

    <p>
      The flying lotus seeds suddenly smacked into the peacock&#8217;s face,
      making the giant beast fall back, screaming in pain. After the slight hit,
      giant red blisters scorched its face. It continued to retreat, crying in
      agony as it did. Then it took off into the skies, flew away, and did not
      return.
    </p>

    <p>
      The lobster seemed to ignore what had happened to the peacock, and instead
      vied to take its place and eat the lotus.
    </p>

    <p>
      But in the next second, blood crystals went airborne once again. They
      rushed into the lobster&#8217;s shell.
    </p>

    <p>
      The lobster roared deafeningly. After sustaining the hit, even the lobster
      decided to retreat. In an instant, it raced off, skittering back to the
      sea.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen was frozen in place, seeing that the red crystal-looking things
      were not actually lotus seeds. They were red wasps, shaped like little
      ruby gemstones. The end of each wasp had a lethal stinger.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen saw the wasps pierce the lobster&#8217;s shell and peacock&#8217;s
      feathers as if it were nothing. The massive blister that had emerged upon
      the peacock&#8217;s face indicated how poisonous it was.
    </p>

    <p>
      To see super creatures like the peacock and lobster run off in fright sent
      a chill coursing down Han Sen&#8217;s spine. Now, he was glad he
      hadn&#8217;t been able to get there before the other creatures. If he had
      been struck by one of those wasps, he&#8217;d have been in far worse
      shape.
    </p>

    <p>
      Many blood crystal wasps were now flying out from the lotus. Han Sen
      wasn&#8217;t sure if the plant itself that birthed the blood-crystals, or
      if a mother wasp had recently planted the eggs. But no matter their
      origin, it was clearly a vicious trap, and it would yield him no benefit.
    </p>

    <p>
      Eighteen wasps now shot out of the lotus, carried by their delicate wings.
      The toxicity of their venom was as dangerous to an ordinary creature as it
      was to a super creature. The consequences of being stung were horrid. At
      first, a giant blister would form. Then, bones would turn to liquid. And
      finally, the body itself would inflate, growing larger and larger until it
      burst like a reservoir of pus and blood.
    </p>

    <p>
      When creatures were splashed with excess venom, although the effect it had
      on them was not as lethal as a straight-up sting, their bodies and faces
      were still left scorched with massive blisters.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Run!&#8221; Han Sen grabbed the silver fox and ran off down to the
      beach. The blood crystal wasps were frighteningly quick, and Han Sen had
      no idea whether or not his body could withstand their sting.
    </p>

    <p>
      Without the light of the peacock, the silver fox and Queen were both able
      to open their eyes. The previously pleasant fragrance had grown lighter,
      and it seemed to snap all the creatures out of their prior daze. In fear,
      everything now fled the vile trap of the wasps.
    </p>

    <p>
      With so many creatures strewn about dead and bloodied, the island looked
      like a snippet of hell itself. The creature death toll must have been
      immeasurable on this day.
    </p>

    <p>
      Two people and a fox ran towards the ocean. No creatures fought amidst
      themselves, or even thought about targeting the humans. Escape was the
      only goal on everything&#8217;s mind at that moment.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;I thought I could reap some benefits from that lotus thingy; little
      did I know how big of a mistake I was about to make!&#8221; Han Sen felt
      like a fool. When he turned around to take a look at what was going on
      behind him, his jaw hit the ground.
    </p>

    <p>
      One of the wasps was headed in their direction. Like a red, blazing
      meteor, it was coming their way at a terrifying speed.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;When people are unlucky, they tend to choke when they drink water.
      With so many other creatures that are free for you to take, why the hell
      have you come for us?!&#8221; Han Sen&#8217;s heart was now stripped of
      all hope.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen&#8217;s body steeled itself, blazing with all the power and might
      he had. His heart thumped like rhythmic thunder. As his seventh sense
      kicked itself onto a whole new level, his blood began to boil.
    </p>

    <p>
      Queen noticed Han Sen was not any slower than she was, which surprised
      her. If Han Sen hadn&#8217;t unlocked his gene lock, there was no way he
      would have been able to keep up with her.
    </p>

    <p>
      But now was not the time to stop and question him over his deception. So
      she gritted her teeth and kept running as fast as she could.
    </p>

    <p>
      As they continued to run, she noticed Han Sen was actually gaining speed.
      Soon, he had overtaken her. After a while, he was far ahead; she
      couldn&#8217;t keep up with him.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen was also just noticing that his speed must have grown
      exponentially since he opened the gene lock.
    </p>

    <p>
      Although Jadeskin did not grant him the power to manipulate and wield ice,
      the amount of power he had gained seemed greater than what most people
      received after opening their gene lock.
    </p>

    <p>
      But his joy drained as he noticed the red wasp drawing nearer and nearer.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen was positive that its target was the three of them. If they
      weren&#8217;t its target, it wouldn&#8217;t have followed them as much as
      it did.
    </p>

    <p>
      But Han Sen was not entirely sure which of the trio was its primary
      target. Was it him? Was it the silver fox? Or was it Queen?
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;We should split up!&#8221; Han Sen yelled at Queen before going off
      in another direction.
    </p>

    <p>
      As he suspected, the wasp turned just as he did. Its target was indeed Han
      Sen.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Fudge! It really is coming for me and the silver fox.&#8221;
      Despite having expected it, Han Sen couldn&#8217;t but feel compelled to
      swear.
    </p>

    <p>
      The wasps were way too fast. Despite his breakneck speed, the wasp had now
      caught up to Han Sen.
    </p>

    <p>
      The wasp made its first attack. With all his power, Han Sen dodged it
      while still maintaining his speed.
    </p>

    <p>
      The blood crystal wasp was so small, it was difficult to keep track of it
      at the speed they were both going. If it wasn&#8217;t for Han Sen&#8217;s
      incredible seventh sense, he&#8217;d have been an oversized blister
      already.
    </p>

    <p>
      Although he was having difficulty following the wasp with his eyes, he
      cast the Dongxuan Sutra and used his feelings to determine when and where
      the wasp would strike next. He successfully dodged each attempted sting.
    </p>

    <p>
      The silver fox, who was still nestled in Han Sen&#8217;s chest, was quite
      alert. Thunder sparked in the wells of its eyes, but try as it might, the
      wasp was too quick for it to thunder shock.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen was not sure how much longer he could go on. All he could do was
      keep dodging on his way to the beach. He had to get into the sea, no
      matter what. If other wasps decided to join the chase, it would all be
      over. It wouldn&#8217;t matter how proficient he was at sensing their
      locations, dodging any more would prove too difficult.
    </p>

    <p>One more was all it would take to tip the scales.</p>

    <p>
      Dealing with this single wasp, Han Sen was already exhausting his unusual
      talents of intuition and judgment. He couldn&#8217;t use his seventh sense
      to lock down the wasp now, either.
    </p>

    <p>
      Queen had already reached the oceanside when she saw Han Sen in the
      distance, having trouble with the wasp. Gritting her teeth, she summoned a
      throwing knife and threw it in his direction.
    </p>

    <p>
      But being unable to track the dizzyingly quick wasp, it was impossible to
      hit it.
