	<p>Han Sen’s fist punched the Dragon that was made of a draconic presence, and it made him into something that was
		like paste. Han Sen punched into the being, pulverizing all the fist came into contact with.</p>

	<p>Pang!</p>

	<p>When Han Sen’s fist collided with Dragon Thirty-Nine’s fist, Dragon Thirty-Nine’s face turned crooked.</p>

	<p>His fist and arm was twisted, too. Dragon Thirty-Nine’s fist came against Han Sen’s fist like a ball hitting a
		sheet of steel. The finger bones cracked, making his facial expressions distort. The whole arm was made to
		twist, shattering the armor as it all occurred.</p>

	<p>Han Sen’s fist was still advancing, as well. It was strong like a piston-driven pillar, driving itself straight
		into Dragon Thirty-Nine’s chest.</p>

	<p>Dragon Thirty-Nine’s muscles were no match, and they immediately buckled to the force and started to cave in. His
		body was quick to look like a cooked shrimp. Dragon blood gushed as Han Sen’s foe went flying backwards.</p>

	<p>Pang!</p>

	<p>Dragon Thirty-Nine’s body came back down, digging a long trench through the earth. He eventually hit rocks. The
		velocity of skid was so strong, he broke through the rocks, and it was only then that he came to a stop.</p>

	<p>Dragon Nineteen and Dragon Nine were both in shock. Their mouths were open wide in what best amounted to a fine
		helping of disbelief. All they could do was stare at the Dragon dust. They could not believe their eyes.</p>

	<p>With Dragon’s bodies being what they were, it was hard to comprehend one could be defeated so easily by someone
		of the same tier. That punch almost killed Dragon Thirty-Nine with ease.</p>

	<p>It wasn’t just the Dragon that were in shock, either. All the other Marquises that witnessed the fight were
		flabbergasted, too.</p>

	<p>That was because it was a Dragon. The world’s bravest sorts were of the Dragon. One of them had been punched,
		soaring through the air like a ragdoll. It was quite scary.</p>

	<p>“Human… dollar… What is that race… Have you heard of them before?”</p>

	<p>“No… human… sounds so strange…”</p>

	<p>“Scary… Even a Dragon’s body was punched that way…”</p>

	<p>“The bodies of humans are scary.”</p>

	<p>Many creatures began to ravenously discuss the event. Dragon Thirty-Nine was soaked in his own blood, hopelessly
		trying to scramble out from the rubble of the rocks. His chest was still sunken and he could barely rise to his
		feet. Dragon blood kept pouring out of his facial orifices.</p>

	<p>“Roar!” Dragon Thirty-Nine roared. His body expanded, and his Dragon wings possessed a frightening draconic aura.
		His body was suddenly overtaken by what looked like real dragon scales. His Dragon horns were shining more than
		ever. Overall, he was now looking like a bonafide dragon, albeit in a humanoid form.</p>

	<p>Furthermore, the arm that had been broken by Han Sen was healed.</p>

	<p>Dragon Thirty-Nine had become a xenogeneic. That was the form he had activated. And with him now firing on all
		cylinders, he approached his opponent. His body broke through space to teleport directly before Han Sen. His
		scaled fists came forward in a punch towards Han Sen’s chest.</p>

	<p>The fist tore through the air and then exploded. To witness the pressure, force, and power of that soaring punch,
		you’d be swift to think that it could obliterate any mountain.</p>

	<p>Another hand appeared then, though. It was one that was clad in a golden armor. It appeared directly before that
		newly-scaled fist. Those long, gold fingers grabbed Dragon Thirty-Nine’s incoming fist.</p>

	<p>That scary punch was brought to a complete standstill. All of its power and desired impact vanished in less than
		a second. It felt as if his punch had all just been pretend, and it was all an illusion where no strength was
		actually used.</p>

	<p>In everyone’s shocked eyes, the gold-armored hand moved. Dragon Thirty-Nine was then picked up by it.</p>

	<p><em>Boom!</em> <em>Boom!</em> <em>Boom!</em> <em>Boom!</em></p>

	<p>The strong xenogeneic body of Dragon Thirty-Nine was reduced into a mere punching bag. Han Sen grabbed it and
		kept swinging it up and down to create two giant craters in the ground.</p>

	<p>Dragon Thirty-Nine’s mutant Dragon body as totally broken. After a few hits, the rigidity was lost and it became
		soft.</p>

	<p>“Wa-la!” The noise of a paper being ripped sounded. Dragon Thirty-Nine’s almost-obliterated body disappeared into
		thin air.</p>

	<p>“Too crazy. He can even kill a Dragon that brutally… how strong is that guy’s body…”</p>

	<p>“He is not of the same level, surely. Dragon Thirty-Nine was quick to rip his paper, but I don’t blame him. A few
		more hits like that and he was bound to blow up.”</p>

	<p>“They were both Marquise, and that guy beat the Dragon. Why are the bodies of humans so scary.”</p>

	<p>“I wonder why I haven’t heard of this race before?”</p>
