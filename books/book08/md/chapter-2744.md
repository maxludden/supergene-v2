  The most unusual thing about his calmness was his scary presence. When the Very High felt that presence, a chill passed through their hearts.

Almost at the same time, Exquisite and Li Keer’s faces relaxed, too. Their bodies replicated Han Sen’s movements, lowering their hands from their previously threatening posture.

“Why does this seem so familiar? This presence…” one of the Very High mumbled with a far off look.

“It isn’t just familiar… This presence feels like the Very High Sense. Why is Han Sen’s body exuding the Very High Sense?” another Very High asked, stumbling as he spoke.

“It isn’t the Very High Sense.” The Ninth Uncle was giving Han Sen an inscrutable stare. “Although the presence is similar, it isn’t really the Very High Sense. It must be a geno art that is a branch of the Very High Sense.”

“A geno art that is an off-shoot of the Very High Sense?” A bunch of the Very High looked at the Ninth Uncle. They weren’t shocked, just confused.

Many geno arts had been derived from the Very High Sense, including the Textless Book of the Sky. There was nothing too strange about the concept of an off-shoot geno art. The strange thing was that despite all their collective knowledge and experience, they didn’t know which of those geno arts the Ninth Uncle was talking about.

The Ninth Uncle’s face looked conflicted. He stared at Han Sen for a while and went on to say, “If my guess is correct, this presence is Sit and Forget Sutra. It was created by our alpha.”

When everyone heard this, jaws fell open all through the gathering. Even those who practiced the Very High Sense couldn’t keep their hearts calm.

The alpha that the Ninth Uncle spoke about was the Very High elder who had left the painting behind on the Ancient Wall. His most famous geno art was the Sit and Forget Sutra, which was derived from Very High Sense.

“The alpha’s Sit and Forget Sutra was lost, wasn’t it? How can Han Sen have the Sit and Forget Sutra’s presence… Is he…” one of the Very High started to say. It was like he had thought of something too ludicrous to continue. He looked at the drawing on the Ancient Wall and said, “Was the Sit and Forget Sutra hidden here in the Ancient Wall all this time?”

This suggestion was met with resounding skepticism. After all, Han Sen was merely an outsider. He had never studied the Very High Sense before. And so many Very High geniuses had failed to discern anything special about the Ancient Wall. Many of the Very High were simply unable to accept that Han Sen, who was just an outsider, could learn the Sit and Forget Sutra through the Ancient Wall.

Despite that, the truth of the matter was directly in front of them. They had to believe it. Han Sen’s body was clearly exuding a presence that felt like the Very High Sense. Considering all the things that had just happened, it really might have been the Sit and Forget Sutra.

It wasn’t just Han Sen, either. Even Exquisite and Li Keer were giving off the same presence. Clearly, they could feel through what Han Sen felt. They had earned the knowledge he had earned, receiving the mysterious Sit and Forget Sutra through him.

Sit and Forget Sutra was made by the Very High elder, but it hadn’t been passed down through the generations like an ordinary geno art. No one in the Very High knew what kind of geno art it was. After the alpha created the Sit and Forget Sutra, he had spoken about it at length, but no one had ever seen him use it.

Then the alpha had gone straight to the Geno Hall. He didn’t record anything about the Sit and Forget Sutra for the Very High to study. Therefore, no one had practiced the Sit and Forget Sutra before.

But after he created the Sit and Forget Sutra, the alpha’s presence had been different from the presence of the Very High who practiced the Very High Sense. This was recorded in the historical records of the Very High. The Ninth Uncle was very familiar with those records, and he came to his theory based on what he sensed from Han Sen. That was how he identified the power before him as belonging to the Sit and Forget Sutra.

The Ninth Uncle’s judgment was correct. Han Sen’s presence was the Sit and Forget Sutra, because extreme yang begets yin. When things reach an extreme, they tend to blowback. When the sad mind was pushed to its limit, Han Sen almost fell into a morbid realm of death. But he never lost his faith. He clung to a bit of his will, balancing himself through the loneliness and fighting back the death that sought him.

Han Sen suddenly felt the sad will rumble with change. The changes were something not even he could understand. The sadness seemed to melt, and what replaced it was a calm sense of serenity not unlike water.

Once that mind changed, Han Sen’s will was no longer affected by the Very High eye. Control of his own body returned. He looked away from the Very High eye mark and looked across the Ancient Wall near him. Now, Han Sen saw the abstract symbols for what they were. They no longer seemed abstract or surreal. It was like he could see a white-haired Very High man sitting crossed-legged, releasing a weird presence.

The eye symbol was the origin point. And he followed the strokes to learn more as if he was watching a tutorial without sound. There were no sounds and no explanations, but for some reason, Han Sen was able to learn a lot just by looking at the drawing. The meaning of the artwork was fed straight into Han Sen’s brain, as if he had already seen the drawing 100,000 times before.

Han Sen stared at the Ancient Wall, segment by segment. He grew more and more excited the further he looked. The painting on the wall was indeed a very mysterious geno art. He soon realized that this geno art was better than any knife skill or punching technique he had ever learned before.

The more Han Sen saw, the more shocked he became. And the more shocked he was, the greater his excitement grew. Even Under the Sky was so much less than the geno art he was now studying.

But Han Sen could also feel that the geno art and Under the Sky each had some unique abilities. It felt like they came from the same origin, but they had been developed in totally different directions.

Han Sen was so absorbed in studying the Sit and Forget Sutra, that he didn’t notice the Very High around him. All of the onlookers had wide eyes, and they were staring at Han Sen, Li Keer, and Exquisite with looks of sheer disbelief. Their faces were full of shock, envy, jealousy, and a lot of emotion.

Han Sen kept studying the picture, and his Sit and Forget Sutra’s presence grew heavier. Anyone could tell Han Sen was learning the secrets of the alpha. He had somehow opened up the mystery of the Ancient Wall’s drawing. Just like the Ninth Uncle said, he must have indeed learned the Sit and Forget Sutra.

And Li Keer and Exquisite must have learned Han Sen’s Sit and Forget Sutra, too. While Han Sen’s knowledge expanded and deepened, the girls’ Sit and Forget Sutra became grander, as well.

Many of the Very High had believed that Exquisite’s resolution to maintain her contract with Han Sen was a stupid idea. But now, they were beyond jealous of her. If Exquisite’s contract had indeed been broken, she wouldn’t have shared Han Sen’s discovery of the Sit and Forget Sutra. That would have been the biggest loss in their history. It would have been unacceptable.

Although Exquisite and Li Keer had both earned the Sit and Forget Sutra, the Very High elites still found themselves staring at Han Sen. An outsider silkworm had learned one of the greatest secrets of the Very High. And it was a secret their own people had failed countless times to uncover. And on top of that, the secret was related to the Very High Sense. The emotions they felt as they looked at Han Sen would have been very difficult to describe.
