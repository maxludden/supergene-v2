<p>While it might have taken some time to describe, in reality, the
fight was over in moments. Han Sen managed to freeze two
half-deifieds and three Kings in a few steps.</p>
<p>“Am I seeing this right? Thunder and Shadow, both of whom are
half-deified, were frozen? Barr is still frozen, too. Are
crystallizers really this strong?”</p>
<p>“This is too cool. One punch, one person. He beat two
half-deified people and three Kings. No wonder he was able to
murder a prince of the Extreme King.”</p>
<p>“Since when have the bodies of crystallizers evolved with such
speed? Weren’t the crystallizers heavily reliant on
technology?”</p>
<p>“It doesn’t seem like a pure, cold power, though. If it was so
simple, Barr and Thunder wouldn’t be completely sealed in the way
they are.”</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>The whole universe was shocked by what Han Sen had done. Sealing
five powerful Kings in mere moments was an impressive feat. No one
had seen that coming.</p>
<p>“This guy is getting stronger and stronger. I’ve got to get
better myself,” Lin Feng said, upon seeing Han Sen’s fight on his
phone. His eyes were sparkling as he walked toward a
xenogeneic-infested mountain.</p>
<p>Wang Yuhang had a Gana woman in his arms at the time, and he was
enjoying himself with scrumptious foods and fine wines. Back during
the Geno Scroll fights, he had bet all his money on Dollar being
victorious. That gamble had an enormous payoff, so now he was able
to afford many of the things he wanted.</p>
<p>“That really p*sses me off. Out of all of us, why is Han Sen the
only one who’s so famous? No… I need to do a live stream of myself.
I want the rednecks of this geno universe to see how great I am by
comparison,” Wang Yuhang said, as he watched Han Sen seal Barr and
four other people. The girls around him were also watching Han
Sen’s fight, screaming in glee with every new attack. It soured
Wang Yuhang’s mood even further.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>“Not bad. He’s almost entered my league. If he keeps on working
hard, he might reach thirty percent of my power,” Xie Qing King
said. He was wearing dark sunglasses, and he had a bottle of beer
in his hand. He was focused on flying his expensive aircraft, but
he also had a pen and paper next to him.</p>
<p>As he flew, a person’s image suddenly appeared on the ship’s
monitor. It was a worker from the Thousand Treasures Alliance.
After seeing Xie Qing King, he smiled and said, “Boss Xie Qing
King, did you finish your third comic yet? The whole universe is
waiting for the threequel to your Overbearing President Love Luv
Looove saga.”</p>
<p>“Argh… hey… argh… what… what are you… oh… the signal is bad…
argh… magnetic storm… oh no… oh no…” Xie Qing King said. Then he
slammed his phone closed.</p>
<p>“What kind of artist would hit a deadline and hand their work in
on time?” Xie Qing King took a sip of his drink and returned to
watching Han Sen fight.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>In the Extreme King, a ghost-like body was emerging from an
empty mountain. It walked into the underworld, traveled through
King’s Kingdom, and headed for the Tianxia System.</p>
<p>“I don’t care if you are Bai Yi or Han Sen. I’m going to beat
you this time!” Bai Wuchang said to himself excitedly as he
traversed the depths of space.</p>
<p>After Han Sen froze Barr and the other four, he intended to
steal any good items they were carrying. A wave of unease washed
through him, though. The smile left his face, and he hurled the
Wanjie Rubix Cube away from him.</p>
<p>The moment Han Sen threw the Wanjie Rubix Cube, a needle-like
blade materialized from the image display of the Wanjie Rubix Cube.
The thin blade flew right past Han Sen’s cheek.</p>
<p>A black shadow followed that blade coming from the Wanjie Rubix
Cube. A person grabbed the Wanjie Rubix Cube and gave Han Sen a
toothy grin.</p>
<p>“Who are you?” Han Sen asked the weird creature that had emerged
from the Wanjie Rubix Cube. A frown furrowed his brow.</p>
<p>The creature had the body of a human but the head of a sheep.
Bat-like wings spread from his back. He had scales, and their black
color glistened.</p>
<p>“I’m Shadow Ghost,” the weird creature said, playing with the
Wanjie Rubix Cube as he spoke.</p>
<p>The Wanjie Rubix Cube was still active, and many of the viewers
froze in their seats when they heard Shadow Ghost’s name.</p>
<p>Shadow Ghost came from the Pirates. Although he was only
half-deified, his name struck fear into the hearts of many. Even
many deified elites were wary of this being. Shadow Ghost came from
a rare race, but his talents were deadly enough to strike fear into
many people of the higher races.</p>
<p>As long as a video was being filmed in a real place, Shadow
Ghost could enter that video and travel to wherever it was being
filmed. That was what he did when he came out of the recording
Wanjie Rubix Cube.</p>
<p>But that wasn’t the scariest thing about him. Once Shadow Ghost
entered a video, he could reveal himself at any time without
warning.</p>
<p>Imagine talking to your good friend or flirting with your lover,
and then suddenly, a sword came out of the video chat and skewered
you. Not many people could react to the threat swiftly enough to
save themselves.</p>
<p>God only knew how many Kings or half-deifieds had been killed in
such a way by Shadow Ghost. Many people were never even aware of
how they died. It was pretty hard to prevent.</p>
<p>“Shadow Ghost is onto him. Han Sen is in danger!”</p>
<p>“No way. How did Han Sen react so quickly earlier? He was
holding his Wanjie Rubix Cube close to his body, but he still
somehow avoided Shadow Ghost’s sneak attack?”</p>
<p>“Yeah! Han Sen just froze five powerful enemies. After that, he
should have been relaxed and off-guard. But he actually avoided the
strike. Did he dodge out of instinct, or did he somehow know what
was coming?”</p>
<p>“Either way, it’s pretty scary.”</p>
<p>Shadow Ghost spun the Wanjie Rubix Cube in his palm as he stared
at Han Sen. He chuckled grimly. “There’s no grudge between us, and
no one has directly hired me to kill you. However, the bounty being
offered by the Extreme King is far too tempting. Today, I will have
to trouble myself to kill you.”</p>
<p>Han Sen had never heard of Shadow Ghost, so he didn’t know who
he was. But seeing him emerge from the video of the Wanjie Rubix
Cube, Han Sen knew what sort of powers he had.</p>
<p>“You were unable to kill me earlier. What makes you think you
can take me on now?” Han Sen asked, raising an eyebrow.</p>
<p>“You think that was all the power I have? Let me show you my
real shadow area.” After that, Shadow Ghost pulled out another
camera with his free hand. There was a loud clicking noise as the
camera flashed.</p>
<p>Han Sen tried to dodge, but he didn’t know where the power was
coming from, so he had no idea which direction to move in.</p>
<p>After the flash, Han Sen’s body simply disappeared. The Shadow
Ghost camera displayed an image of Han Sen.</p>
<p>But in the picture, Han Sen was able to move and talk. It was
like a laptop.</p>
<p>The flash had made Han Sen feel as if things were all dreamy,
and that he was drifting in space. Everything around him was gray,
and there was a shadow in front of him that he could barely see.
That shadow was Shadow Ghost.</p>
