  Shi Beifeng’s people had not reacted yet. They were still holding the cage while they stared at the stumbling Crystal Kirin in shock.

The Crystal Kirin lifted itself up off the ground. It wished to fly off, but before long, it fell back down again.

Han Sen patted the Crystal Kirin’s head, and very much like a turtle, it barely moved. He grabbed the Crystal Kirin and threw it into the cage. Then, he closed the cage door.

“Brother Shi, the mission has been accomplished. Okay, I have to go. I’ll return the tablet to you in a month.” After that, Han Sen mounted his legless crane and left.

“That’s it?” The people snapped out of their daze. They looked at the caged Crystal Kirin in befuddlement.

Someone sighed and said, “When he fought Lone Bamboo, it was an acceptable bout. But when he fights against normal Earls, they don’t stand a chance against him. Even mutant Earl xenogeneics can be captured so easily? He must be the strongest.”

Shi Beifeng looked at them expressionlessly and said, “The strength of an elite that can fight Lone Bamboo isn’t something you lot can ever guess.”

Han Sen rode the legless crane to a flat mesa. It was difficult to fight in the water, and a mountainous landscape would be hard to navigate. Open plains were the easiest places to fight.

But before Han Sen made it over the mountains, he heard a bird in the sky. There was a big black bird that was ten meters long, coming down from the clouds.

Han Sen pulled out Ghost Teeth Knife and slashed with his knife air. The bird’s body was quickly shattered.

“Xenogeneic Earl hunted. Black-Feather Bird: xenogeneic gene found.”

Rare Beast Island was a great place for Han Sen. There were many Earl xenogeneics about, and in less than a week, Han Sen was able to obtain all the Earl genes he required. He reached a hundred.

The legless crane was able to dine on a lot of the xenogeneic flesh, too. And Han Sen also gave Bubble a lot of energy. It evolved and became a Viscount.

But Bubble was still not very useful. It could make itself look like an ordinary creature, but it couldn’t wield their actual powers.

“There’s still most of the month left. It’d be a waste to leave it now. Why don’t I use this opportunity to hunt some Marquises? That way, I won’t have to look for them when I become one myself.” Han Sen hunted Earls as he scoured the land, looking to pick up the trail of a Marquise.

After Han Sen leveled up his Dongxuan Sutra, his power had grown. Super Spank had become stronger, but more importantly, the Dongxuan Sutra could now be used to build up a sequence structure.

Han Sen could use the Dongxuan Aura to see sequence structures, and he could break the substance between. Doing this severed the substance’s chain.

But Han Sen’s power had to be strong enough to break them, of course. If he was unable to do that, then Super Spank was useless.

Now the Dongxuan Aura had a different substance that could link sequence chains, allowing him to combine two different powers. It was similar to how Han Sen could use sword and knife powers simultaneously. Doing that, he’d become much more powerful.

With Han Sen’s power, using the Dongxuan Aura to fight Marquise creatures wouldn’t be too difficult.

But not all substances were stronger when combined. Some had side-effects, so Han Sen had spent some time running tests. He wanted to find out more about the connections he could make.

But for now, the strongest combination was Teeth Knife and Lone Bamboo’s sword skills. After Han Sen combined Double Fly and Teeth Knife power, the results were poor. The two powers were rendered weaker.

There weren’t many Marquises in the area, perhaps because it was an Earl’s territory. He looked around for half a day until he found one resting beneath a tree.

The xenogeneic was under the boughs of a tree, and it looked like a cow. It was three meters tall, and its back was laden with spikes. It was quite scary.

Han Sen approached the xenogeneic and drew out his Ghost Teeth Knife. He slashed towards the xenogeneic’s head.

The rabbit shoes provided him a burst of speed, and Ghost Teeth Knife was imbued with the powers of knives and swords. He did not try to use Super Spank powers, though. If that power annihilated the sequence structure, the xenogeneic’s entire body would dissolve, including the xenogeneic gene. That would just be wasteful.

Katcha!

Although Han Sen did not use Super Spank, and he only used knife and sword powers, he was still able to cut the Marquise xenogeneic’s head off.

A big cow head rolled across the ground, and the headless body squirted blood like a fountain.

“Xenogeneic Marquise hunted. Stone Cow: xenogeneic gene found.”

Han Sen felt depressed. Rare Beast Island was bad luck for him. He had killed many xenogeneics, but he hadn’t earned a single beast soul.

Han Sen used Ghost Teeth Knife to cut open the Stone Cow’s body. He found a heart that looked like stone, so it was safe to guess that was the xenogeneic gene.

Han Sen took the stone heart from its chest, and he suddenly sensed that something was wrong. He looked behind him, and on the field, there was a grey Stone Cow staring at him with red eyes.

This Stone Cow looked like the other one, but bigger. Its presence was far scarier, as well.

Moo! Before Han Sen could get a good look, the beast raised its legs and slammed them back down. A shockwave moved out like ripples on water. It spread in widening circles.

Han Sen drew Ghost Teeth Knife again and swung it at the shockwave.

Ghost Teeth Knife’s knife air cut through the shockwave, but the shockwave itself was like magic. When the shockwave touched Han Sen’s fingers, he noticed that the armor on his hands had been turned to grey stone.

The Stone Cow roared, lowered its head, and pointed its horns at Han Sen. It thundered forward like a train, and the earth shook beneath its hooves.

Han Sen used his powers, but he couldn’t get rid of the petrification. He was shocked. He quickly summoned the Red Reaper beside the Stone Cow’s head and had it slash the creature’s neck.
