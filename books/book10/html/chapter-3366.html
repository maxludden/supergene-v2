<h2>Killing Tail Fire Beast</h2>
<h3>Chapter 3366</h3>

<p>While everyone’s emotions were in the realm of weirdness,
something strange happened. A vortex appeared in the sea of fire. A
lot of fire went into the vortex.</p>
<p>Everyone was quickly able to see Han Sen’s holy body manifest
inside the swirl. It was a bit different from what they previously
believed.</p>
<p>Han Sen had not been melted by the flame power. Instead, he had
become very strange. The outside of his body was covered with an
ice-crystal shield, but the ice-crystal shield had turned into a
weird, screw-shaped thing that looked like a sea conch hooking
outside Han Sen’s body.</p>
<p>The crazy fire went inside the sea conch shield. It followed the
sea conch’s shape like a screw going inside. It looked like many
fire dragons were surrounding Han Sen’s body and dancing
strangely.</p>
<p>The fire power kept going in. It made the fire vortex in the
shield go faster. The fire was restricted in the movement and
controlled by the ice-jade power. Its mass was going to be
suppressed. It created a weird vortex. It could not get close to
Han Sen’s body.</p>
<p>“Let’s see just how much you can endure.” After witnessing this
scene, Tail Fire Beast did not stop. It coldly laughed and made the
fire rage at Han Sen with even greater ferocity.</p>
<p>The Burning Red Sky lacked everything but fire. It was going to
break Han Sen’s sea conch shell shield.</p>
<p>The transparent sea conch shield was hit with more fire. The
whole sea conch turned red like a sculpture made out of red
crystal. The fire inside was red and burning. The flames looked
white and gold. It made the people spectating start to worry. They
thought the shield might be melted by the fire.</p>
<p>Yet, Han Sen’s face remained as still and stoic as ever. His
situation appeared dangerous, but it was not as dangerous as others
might have imagined.</p>
<p>He used the white sheep fairy’s hollow structure to separate a
few pipelines in the sea conch’s shell. It looked like there was
only one fire inside it. In fact, it was separated into many
different paths of fire. The self-impact power was used to suppress
it all during the process.</p>
<p>Of course, that was just the first step. Han Sen ultimately did
not want to control the fire.</p>
<p>When the whole sea conch shell turned purple and white, Han
Sen’s eyes blazed with a cold light. He reached out his fingers.
The sea conch shell rose up and became smaller in space. It turned
into a marble-sized sea conch shell in Han Sen’s hands.</p>
<p>There was a very strong sense of suppression in that mini sea
conch fire. Han Sen looked at Tail Fire Beast and put the sea conch
between his thumb and middle finger. He flicked it at Tail Fire
Beast.</p>
<p>Tail Fire Beast felt the scary flame power inside the sea conch,
but it was not afraid. It coldly laughed and asked, “Do you want to
use this power to beat me? You must be far too naive to believe
that is possible. Even if you put your flame power into it at its
max, as long as it is fire power, it will obey me. No matter how
strong it is, it will not hurt me. What you have done has only
helped me. It is also enough to kill you.”</p>
<p>After that, Tail Fire Beast shot out another scary fire. He was
going to break the sea conch and release the undying suppression
fire inside. He was going to use that fire to burn Han Sen.</p>
<p>“It is scary to be ignorant. What a dumb fool with just limbs
and power.” Han Sen coldly looked at Tail Fire Beast but did not do
anything.</p>
<p>Pang!</p>
<p>The fire arrow struck the sea conch. The fire arrow’s power
worked with the fire inside from the outside. The sea conch
suddenly cracked. The purple-white fire flowed out of it, burying
everything around. Han Sen and Tail Fire Beast were drenched in the
fire.</p>
<p>“Humans are so naïve,” a scary Break World beast said with a
great look of disdain for the exhibit. “He wants to use suppressive
fire to kill Tail Fire Beast. Does he not know the Burning Red
Sky’s leader Tail Fire Beast is a fire god? No fire can hurt
him.”</p>
<p>Many powerful creatures thought Han Sen had used the wrong skill
as well. Against the Burning Red Sky’s leader, fire was
useless.</p>
<p>Suppressing fire was not stable. It suddenly released a scary
power, which quickly vanished.</p>
<p>When the purple and white fire was suppressed, everyone was able
to see what was happening on the battleground.</p>
<p>Han Sen was still safe standing on the ground and holding
Bao’er. There was a sea conch shield outside of his body. It guided
the fire to spin inside it. It reduced half of the explosive
impact.</p>
<p>While it was in the air, Tail Fire Beast was riddled with
several holes. The lava-like blood of the beast was gushing out.
Its eyes were rendered into smoky holes.</p>
<p>“How was that possible?” Many scary creatures looked on in
disbelief.</p>
<p>Tang Zhenliu lost his voice as he laughed and said, “Ah,
typical. It really does appear as if those dumb Break World beasts
have a really low level of intelligence. Do they not know anything?
Do they not understand what bullet theory is? The real deadly fire
is not the energy of its explosion. It is the substances that are
pushed by energy.”</p>
<p>Tail Fire Beast was bleeding lots of blood that looked like
lava. It roared, wanting to stir up another incendiary storm. As it
roared, its body collapsed. Blood came gushing out of every orifice
in its body. It was like countless amounts of volcanoes were all
erupting at the same time.</p>
<p>Boom! Boom!</p>
<p>Tail Fire Beast’s giant body fell. It fell into a hot lava sea
and sank into it.</p>
<p>As many scary creatures were watching this in shock, a light
flew out of the lava and came before Han Sen. It was a mysterious
spell. It was the mark that had been on Tail Fire Beast’s forehead
moments before. It represented the Burning Red Sky’s will. It was
the sky leader’s mark.</p>
<p>Now that it was appearing in front of Han Sen, everyone
understood what was happening. Han Sen had replaced Tail Fire Beast
to become a new owner of Burning Red Sky.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Break World Beast Hunted: Ultimate Tail Fire Beast. Found Break
World Gene.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>An announcement sounded in Han Sen’s brain.</p>
<p>Han Sen looked at the sky leader’s mark. He raised his hand and
let the mark appear in his palm. The mark blended into his
skin.</p>
<p>When this was all done, the fires of Burning Red Sky went mad.
They did not seek to hurt Han Sen though. It was like the sky and
the ground were releasing fireworks in praise. It was as if they
were celebrating the birth of a new fire leader.</p>
<p>The geno tablet’s video stream ended there. There was a new
ranking on the leader leaderboard. The names on the 15th sky were
still glowing. However, Tail Fire Beast’s name was no longer
there.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Fifteenth Sky Leader: Han Sen</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That line of words shone in the main and reverse universes. It
drew the attention of many creatures. All the races in the geno
universe were happy.</p>
<p>Finally, a creature from the geno universe had obtained the seat
of a leader. It was also done by slaying another leader. The geno
universe’s creatures were all very happy about this.</p>
<p>“What a scary man. He only has a Break World rate of 60%, and he
only used a simple skill to easily kill Tail Fire Beast.” Many
Break World beasts felt conflicted about this.</p>
<p>Han Sen’s fight gave many weak Break World beasts see the hope
of being weaker yet still being able to topple the strong. They
also knew that they could not outright do it as Han Sen had.</p>
