Dong!

Gu Qingcheng’s sword and Sha Linjia’s fist collided. Neither of them reeled back, and they came at each other repeatedly, strike after strike, neither of them appearing to have the upper hand.

“You are able to do battle with my Godblood! You should be proud.” Sha Linjia’s body was flashing red like an erupting volcano. He got in a blast that was immeasurably powerful, and it sent Gu Qingcheng stumbling backwards.

“That is so strong. What is up with that shura?” Han Sen frowned.

The other shura and super creatures were going towards Little Silver as this occurred, all looking very angry,

The other shura also used Shura Change, but theirs was the normal one. Their bodies simply became stronger as they were supposed to, and none of their bodies blazed with fire.

Even so, thirteen fourth ranked shura fighters and fourteen super creatures was a terrifying amount of power for any host to be subjected to. Little Silver and the others would not be enough.

“Uncle Qing Ya, why is Han Sen not here?” Tina rode a big bird, something similar to a peacock. She came over to Qing Ya’s side.

“He should be in the Alliance. He is not here just yet,” Qing Ya said.

Tina was disappointed by this, and she said, “That means I came for nothing.”

“Not really. You can enjoy the spectacle of an amazing fight.” Qing Ya smiled.

Tina looked over with disdain and said, “What good is there in watching? Father rewarded Sha Linjia with Godblood. Of course he’s stronger than that human woman.”

“Sometimes that is hard to tell,” Qing Ya said quietly.

Seeing Gu Qingcheng do combat with Sha Linjia, the shura and super creatures went for the creatures in the shelter. But then, they saw Red Pony emerge. It was tiny when compared to the shura and creatures that were stampeding forward. Strangely, it also looked fearless, and its head was lifted, as if in massive pride. The shura ahead came at the Red Pony, throwing punches.

Red Pony then roared with its head lifted, and its voice came out like a shockwave. It pushed back the super creatures and shura that had neared it.

The shockwave was so strong, it was even visible. It covered the entirety of Shadow Shelter. When the shura and super creatures were able to stand up again, they tried breaking the disc of the shockwave. They were unable to.

Their powers were breaking like fireworks outside the shelter, as Red Pony watched them with an unmoving expression. It had most certainly halted their attempted penetration of the shelter.

Now, Han Sen was really able to confirm Red Pony was the scariest creature there. It was the one to watch out for in that big battle. Red Pony couldn’t have been much weaker than the elder, so Han Sen wasn’t sure why he hadn’t been willing to stay with him.

“I thought only Han Sen and the woman were strong. Why is there something else so strong residing in the shelter?” Tina looked surprised.

Qing Ya was surprised, too. “The reputation Han Sen has now does not stem from simple luck. It is not surprising he has such mighty elites in his employ. Sha Linjia should most certainly ensure he is prepared.”

Sha Linjia was currently engaged in the fight against Gu Qingcheng, though, and an obvious victor had yet to be determined.

Gu Qingcheng knew that with Red Pony there, the shura and super creatures would not be able to make it inside the shelter. So, she wasn’t too worried about Elysian Moon’s safety. She waved her bronze sword with overbearing sword skills.

Sha Linjia’s red flames were no worse than what Gu Qingcheng wielded. The way he fought was entirely shura, though. His entire body was a weapon, and he could attack with any part of his body.

Han Sen was frozen as he watched them fight They really made him open his eyes.

Especially Sha Linjia’s skills, which were different than a human’s. There was no focus on feeling; it was all about the raw power dealt through combat. He was a killing machine.

Sha Linjia saw his men stop. He looked at them strangely and shouted.

When the shura heard his shout, they all stopped trying to fight back against the shockwave. Instead, they each brought out a vial of red liquid. They opened it and fed it to the super creatures they had previously ridden.

The super creatures seemed to have really wanted the red liquid, too. They all scrambled over each other, fighting to get theirs first And when they did consume the drink, their lifeforces suddenly became much stronger. Their powers were given a red hue, and it looked as if they had been made berserk.

“No way! Fourteen super creatures have become berserk? What kind of red liquid is that?” Han Sen was frozen.

The difference in power between super creatures and berserk super creatures was not a whole tier of strength, like sacred to super. It was half at best. But it was also more difficult to achieve than going from gemstone to super.

The Fourth God’s Sanctuary’s super creatures were much stronger than the super creatures populating the three prior sanctuaries. Even so, berserk super creatures were always quite rare and difficult to find.

Now, fourteen super creatures had become berserk super creatures by drinking a vial of liquid. It was quite difficult to fathom the implications.

Han Sen did not believe it, but he couldn’t deny the fact it was happening right before his eyes. After the super creatures drank the liquid, their bodies and geno cores became stronger.

A mountain-looking geno core landed on the shockwave ring and shook. Other geno cores joined in, some like swords that came against the force to try and cut through it.

All those geno cores came against the aura with equal power. It started to shake and tremble, and it eventually cracked.

Red Pony’s face finally changed. He roared and increased the power he had put into that force. Even so, with the fourteen creatures attacking, the aura still felt as if it was going to break any second.

“You are strong, but I will win! That is because I have Godblood and you are just a meager human.” Sha Linjia stepped back, gathering a red fire on his fist. It looked like a swirling vortex, and it gradually burned brighter and brighter.

“Godblood? In my time, Gods were never that strong. For Qi Gong Masters, our task is to kill them.”

Gu Qingcheng lowered her bronze sword. Her lifeforce became like water, as it began to gather and twirl around her sword.

The name of her sword was Pure. It was a superior blade, one of the ten most famous weapons from ancient history. Gu Qingcheng carried it whenever she practiced Qi Gong. When she became a demigod, she did not create a self geno core, and instead just used that sword as one. With it, she practiced her sword skill talents.
