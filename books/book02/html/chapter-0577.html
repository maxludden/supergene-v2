    <p>
      Han Sen was still unsure whether or not hisJadeskin had issues.
      Regardless, he decided not to continue practicing it and put it aside.
      Instead, he moved his focus on to training with the Dongxue Sutra.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen wanted to learn the first tier of the Dongxue Sutra sooner now, so
      he could unlock his first gene lock.
    </p>

    <p>
      He saw the strength that Xue Yi Kuang had possessed through the unlocking
      of his own first gene lock. Han Sen was beginning to realize that
      acquiring such power would be imperative for the future, particularly with
      his desire to do battle with super creatures. He had witnessed first-hand
      the strength possessed by super creatures, like what the silver fox and
      the blue seahorse had shown, and he knew he would have to improve a great
      deal before he could be a match for them.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;I wonder what powers I might gain after unlocking the first tier
      gene lock with the Dongxue Sutra? This skill may not have powers
      attributed to the elements like fire and water, or even thunder; it only
      makes my body smell good! Unlike Zhu Ting&#8217;s Deadly Perfume, can I
      beat my opponents through just a pleasant body odor?&#8221; Han Sen
      mulled.
    </p>

    <p>
      He came to the realization that no, it would not be possible. Dongxue was
      the master of Xuan Men, yet using the power of smell to beat foes seemed
      like such a feminine move. It didn&#8217;t quite match his persona.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen was hoping to acquire grand performance enhancements following his
      unlocking of the first tier of the Dongxue Sutra. Still, he couldn&#8217;t
      rush such a thing. So, Han Sen trained and practiced it every day,
      purifying himself from the problems that arose withJadeskin at the same
      time.
    </p>

    <p>
      Also, Han Sen&#8217;s mastery of Dual was almost complete. Soon, he could
      take on the Twin Spirit for real, but even though victory seemed
      achievable, it would still be a difficult fight.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen also spent time planning how he might cooperate with Li Xing Lun
      and Brother Philip in launching an attack on the royal shelter. Although
      he would be able to take on the Twin Spirit at the royal shelter by
      himself and claim the area, it would be a waste not to take out the
      spirits and creatures that resided there.
    </p>

    <p>
      When the spirits were there, the creatures would gather up inside the
      shelter. If the spirits were captured, then the creatures would run off.
      If you wanted to kill them, you&#8217;d have to look for them one-by-one.
      If he took the opportunity to launch a strike with Li Xing Lun and Brother
      Philip, they&#8217;d at least be able to take down a couple of
      sacred-blood creatures and increase his sacred geno points.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Brother Han, are you free today? Could you teach me how to
      fight?&#8221; Han Sen had just returned to the Blackgod Shelter, and
      already Qi Xiuwen was fretting for his attention.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;I don&#8217;t have the time; I have had deeds of greater importance
      on my mind recently,&#8221; Han Sen responded.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Brother Han, what big things are you looking to do?&#8221; Qi
      Xiuwen&#8217;s eyes possessed a strange look as he questioned Han Sen.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;It&#8217;ll be a cooperative task with the Starwheel Shelter and
      Philip, in which we will take down the royal shelter,&#8221; Han Sen
      casually answered.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Brother Han really is a person who does big things. I would like to
      help, though. I can aid you when the time comes to take on this royal
      shelter you speak of,&#8221; Qi Xiuwen excitedly said.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;If you have the heart, I will provide you with the task of
      enlisting the aid of the Starwheel Shelter and Philip Shelter.&#8221; Han
      Sen smiled and looked at Qi Xiuwen fondly.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;I will not disappoint you!&#8221; Qi Xiuwen asked for a few of Han
      Sen&#8217;s men, and then took off to the Philip Shelter.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Mister Qi, you really are going to help Han Sen take down the royal
      shelter?&#8221; After they had left the shelter, an evolver following Qi
      Xiuwen posed the question.
    </p>

    <p>&#8220;Why wouldn&#8217;t I?&#8221; Qi Xiuwen said.</p>

    <p>
      &#8220;If you are going to fight, at least wait for us to bring down Han
      Sen. At least that way, you can be the one to lead the fight. If we take
      down the royal shelter now, doesn&#8217;t that just benefit Han
      Sen?&#8221; The evolvers weren&#8217;t able to understand.
    </p>

    <p>
      Qi Xiuwen smiled and replied, &#8220;You are wrong. If we let Han Sen take
      down the shelter now, we will be the ones to benefit.&#8221;
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Why? What are you planning to do?&#8221; The evolvers were ardent
      followers of Qi Xiuwen, and their interest in their master&#8217;s goals
      was fervent.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Do you know what lies on the other side of the royal
      shelter?&#8221; Qi Xiuwen did not answer them directly.
    </p>

    <p>
      A good many of the evolvers shook their heads because none of them had
      traveled beyond the royal shelter before and espied what lay behind the
      royal shelter of the ice field.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;After I leveled up to become an evolver and arrived at the ice
      field, I immediately launched an investigation of my own into the area.
      Not too long ago, I sent out a number of spies to check out what was
      behind the royal shelter.&#8221; Qi Xiuwen smiled when telling them.
    </p>

    <p>
      One evolver understood what he was getting at, and said, &#8220;Mister Qi
      is going to wait until Han Sen has conquered the royal shelter. At that
      point, we will surround Han Sen and take the shelter for ourselves!&#8221;
    </p>

    <p>
      Qi Xiuwen elaborated by saying, &#8220;Well, it won&#8217;t really be
      &#8216;taking.&#8217; We are the ones who own the Blackgod Shelter,
      whereas Han Sen only owns the people from the Goddess Shelter. The royal
      shelter has nothing to do with my deal with my father and the Teng family.
      If I take that shelter, it is mine by right.&#8221;
    </p>

    <p>
      One evolver hesitatingly said, &#8220;But Han Sen is so powerful! When he
      killed our former master, Blackgod was under the protection of a few
      hundred evolvers. I am afraid&#8230;&#8221; The evolver&#8217;s sentence
      drifted off in a fearful tremble, but Qi Xiuwen understood what he was
      getting at.
    </p>

    <p>
      Qi Xiuwen smiled and said, &#8220;Are you worried he will do me harm when
      he is angry? He wouldn&#8217;t dare touch me, and I wager he doesn&#8217;t
      have a sufficient amount of power to challenge me even if he did find the
      guts. Even if he hadn&#8217;t harbored the desire to take on this royal
      shelter of his own volition, I would have pushed him to formulate this
      plan of attack sometime. His mentioning the plan to me was perfectly
      coincidental and coincidentally beneficial.&#8221;
    </p>

    <p>
      A few evolvers still seemed hesitant. Qi Xiuwen then smiled and said,
      &#8220;I have spent much time with Han Sen. Through the time I have asked
      to be taught by him, I have come to learn much about the abilities he
      possesses. Even if I haven&#8217;t learned 100% of what he is capable of,
      I am fairly sure I know at least 70%. And in regards to his power? I have
      accurately assessed his capacity in that regard, too. There is nothing to
      fear. If I know all of this about him, do you really think he can escape
      my grasp?&#8221;
    </p>

    <p>
      Seeing how hesitant and fearful his evolvers still were, he continued by
      saying, &#8220;The Blackgod Shelter is composed of our people. I have even
      asked for the assistance of Thunder Devil and Lightning God. Do you really
      think Han Sen stands a chance against our combined forces?&#8221;
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Thunder Devil and Lightning God will join us?&#8221; In an instant,
      the mood of the evolvers took a swing for the positive.
    </p>

    <p>
      Thunder Devil and Lightning God were brothers, but no one knew their true
      names. They were famous evolvers that had pledged their support to Qi
      Xiuwen&#8217;s father. They were amongst the best an evolver could ever
      become and were not far off becoming surpassers. If they leveled up, they
      could become Celestial Beings, and neither was someone that ordinary
      people could touch.
    </p>

    <p>
      This was especially true for Thunder Devil. Rumors said that he had
      already unlocked the first tier of his gene lock. His talents were
      shockingly powerful, and no evolver would dare make him their enemy.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;If we have over 10,000 evolvers in the Blackgod Shelter and have
      the assistance of Thunder Devil and Lightning God, Han Sen is a dead man
      walking,&#8221; an evolver then proclaimed with glee.
    </p>

    <p>
      Qi Xiuwen smiled and went on by saying, &#8220;That being said, Han Sen is
      a smart person. Killing him would be quite the shame, so if he knows his
      place and obeys, I could keep him around as a subordinate.&#8221;
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Pah, Han Sen never stood a chance of outpacing the likes of you. He
      would be a lucky man to be given the opportunity to follow you. But
      regardless, he is a dangerous person. I am afraid&#8230;&#8221;
    </p>

    <p>
      Again, the evolver trailed off before finishing his sentence, but Qi
      Xiuwen knew what he was implying. Acting uncaring, he merely responded,
      &#8220;Have him take a Geno Creation pill.&#8221;
    </p>

    <p>
      The face of each evolver warped into one of fright upon hearing the words
      &#8220;Geno Creation pill.&#8221;
    </p>
