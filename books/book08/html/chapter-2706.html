<p>But Bao Lian was aware that Han Sen had the Shield of the
Medusa’s Gaze. Even Meng Lie had been frozen by Han Sen and left to
dangle in the sky. The Extreme King had spent a great many
resources resuscitating Meng Lie after that gross defeat. In
addition, Bao Lian was just a primitive deified. He wouldn’t dare
try to take on the Shield of the Medusa’s Gaze if it was used
against him.</p>
<p>“We have brought Han Sen to the god area for practice. I hope
you can teach him a thing or two, sir,” Li Keer said.</p>
<p>“If you are both asking this of me, then I would be remiss not
to help out. But if we use weapons, someone might get hurt. I
suggest we don’t make use of treasures. What do you both think of
that?” Bao Lian said with a smile.</p>
<p>“What you say makes sense, Mr. Bao.” Exquisite could see through
what Bao Lian was thinking, but she still agreed with his
suggestion.</p>
<p>If they didn’t agree, Bao Lian might refuse to fight against Han
Sen. And if treasures were allowed, Han Sen probably wouldn’t gain
as much battle experience. For Li Keer and Exquisite, that would
defeat the point.</p>
<p>As far as whether Bao Lian would try to kill Han Sen, Exquisite
wasn’t worried about it. Bao Lian was just a primitive deified.
Even though he wouldn’t be using treasures, Han Sen still had God’s
Wander. That in itself was very good. It wouldn’t be difficult for
him to escape danger if the need for flight arose. With the two of
them near, as well, it was unlikely Han Sen would be killed.</p>
<p>Han Sen had no opinion on the matter. He was more interested in
finding out the difference between his current strength and that of
a primitive deified.</p>
<p>Bao Lian, seeing Exquisite agree, smiled and said, “In that
case, I can help you.”</p>
<p>Han Sen knew what Bao Lian was thinking, as well. But he didn’t
address the matter. He walked up to Bao Lian and looked the man
over. “What is your connection to Bao Qin?”</p>
<p>When Han Sen said the name Bao Qin, and it made Bao Lian’s face
run cold. He said in an icy voice, “Bao Qin is a family
member.”</p>
<p>“Ah, you guys are family? That is good. I never did get to wrap
up matters with him, the last time we met. If you are from the same
family, allow me to exact my vengeance through you. Sins of the
family, and all,” Han Sen said.</p>
<p>“Of course, I feel the same. But what do you mean by vengeance?”
Bao Lian asked, laughing darkly.</p>
<p>“To exact my vengeance, I think it is only right that we fight
for our lives. You don’t have to worry about the rules. Use
everything you have at your disposal. Life and death is a matter of
fate, after all,” Han Sen said.</p>
<p>“Huh? You’re going to use the Shield of the Medusa’s Gaze to
fight me?” Bao Lian looked at Han Sen and spoke in a hard voice. He
didn’t think Han Sen would be nice enough to let him kill him if
things ended up that way.</p>
<p>Han Sen didn’t speak. He took off his Apollo Set and handed the
garb over to Li Keer. He then passed the Shield of the Medusa’s
Gaze to her.</p>
<p>“Just like before, I will not use treasures. You, however, can
use whatever you like,” Han Sen said to Bao Lian after he finished
divesting himself of treasures.</p>
<p>Bao Lian looked at Han Sen with confusion. He had no idea what
Han Sen was thinking, but whatever it was, it looked like the man
was committing suicide. But Han Sen didn’t look like someone who
wanted to die. He must have had a trick up his sleeve, Bao Lian
figured.</p>
<p>“What? An Extreme King deified is scared of a bare-handed
half-deified?” Han Sen looked at Bao Lian with a wolfish smile.</p>
<p>“I’m just afraid these two ladies might disagree.” Bao Lian
grunted as he looked at Exquisite and Li Keer.</p>
<p>“If this is his decision, then we cannot interfere,” Exquisite
said.</p>
<p>She and Li Keer could read Han Sen’s mind, so they didn’t need
him to explain his intentions.</p>
<p>“In that case, please don’t take what is about to happen as a
show of disrespect to the Very High.” Bao Lian’s eyes shone with a
godly light. He peered at Han Sen as substance chains unfolded
around him like petals. They wrapped him up.</p>
<p>Han Sen didn’t move, but he pushed the power of The Story of
Genes as far as it would go. He looked at Bao Lian and said, “Do
it. If you let me strike first, I’m afraid you will be unable to
fight back.”</p>
<p>“If you want to die, then I’m happy to fulfill your wish.” Bao
Lian was filled with fury when he heard Han Sen’s boasting. He
looked murderous. But he didn’t lose his cool. He opened his
fingers wide and looked at Han Sen.</p>
<p>A giant lotus flower substance chain appeared next to Han Sen.
The petals fluttered open, as if they were ready to snatch and
throttle Han Sen.</p>
<p>Han Sen teleported away. Like the wind, he slipped out of the
attack.</p>
<p>Bao Lian’s power looked like blooming flowers. Wherever his
attacks went, lotuses would appear. It made Han Sen appear to be
dancing across a sea of flowers.</p>
<p>Han Sen was calm. He traveled around the sea of flowers, not
being harmed by Bao Lian’s substance chains.</p>
<p>“Han Sen’s battle power has improved. The deified Bao Lian isn’t
even making him break a sweat,” muttered Li Keer. She was shocked
whenever she read Han Sen’s mind and saw how cool he was.</p>
<p>Exquisite nodded and said, “It looks like the fight against the
Red Blood Demon helped him grow a lot. It is a shame we were unable
to see the details of that fight. If we could, it would have helped
us a lot.”</p>
<p>“It is fine. In the god area, we are bound to meet many more
elites. There will be plenty more chances for us to learn,” Li Keer
said.</p>
<p>“This isn’t the same. Fighting against the Red Blood Demon was a
real deathmatch. In this god area, the other elites are going to go
easy on Han Sen because of you and I. Han Sen won’t get much out of
it. His life isn’t really on the line.” Exquisite paused for a bit,
and then she went on to say, “This fight will probably help Han Sen
a good amount, though. If you and I pay close attention, we are
bound to get something out of it.”</p>
<p>Li Keer nodded, and then they both stopped talking. They were
trying to focus on Han Sen’s feelings and learn how his mind worked
during a fight like this.</p>
<p>Bao Lian’s heart was pounding. He realized that he had no clue
how to stop Han Sen. His speed and power were greater than Han
Sen’s, but his opponent still seemed to know everywhere he was
going to attack. Han Sen could always dash to safety and render his
attacks void.</p>
<p>Han Sen was more than disappointed with his enemy. He was up
against a primitive deified, but Bao Lian was far weaker than the
Red Blood Demon. Their power levels might be similar, but the Bao
Lian’s will and combat experience were far inferior.</p>
<p>“The Red Blood Demon really did possess a true god mind. He was
nothing like an average primitive deified.” Han Sen realized he was
now fighting a proper primitive deified. Although he wasn’t
stronger, it wouldn’t be easy for a primitive deified to keep Han
Sen under their thumb. If all four of his geno arts were elevated
to half-deified, he could probably take down a primitive deified
with relative ease.</p>
<p>Bao Lian couldn’t suppress Han Sen. His face had reddened with
rage and embarrassment. He was a deified of the Extreme King, and
yet he couldn’t suppress Han Sen, who wasn’t even using any
treasures. It would be embarrassing if people learned about
this.</p>
<p>Bao Lian saw Exquisite and Li Keer staring at the fight with
expressionless faces. He thought to himself, “If Han Sen has a
death wish, then I will kill him even though he is with the Very
High.”</p>
<p>With that thought, Bao Lian stopped hesitating. His forehead
shone with a god light. A white lotus flower appeared on his brow,
and it began to spin around and around.</p>
<p>“Finally, it’s here. I wonder what Bao Lian’s King body can
accomplish.” Han Sen had expected this to happen, and so he watched
Bao Lian closely.</p>
