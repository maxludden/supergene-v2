    <p>
      Han Sen had now read the Light Son of God&#8217;s energy flow. Whenever
      his foe drew upon energy, Han Sen could calculate the exact time
      he&#8217;d make his next move.
    </p>

    <p>
      Dongxuan Sutra was now beginning to prove its worth. Han Sen wanted to
      dodge the Light Son of God&#8217;s attacks before they were even executed,
      and later lead him into the exact position he wanted him to be. By doing
      this, he had greatly improved prediction and formation.
    </p>

    <p>
      From the beginning up until now, that was what Han Sen had sought to
      achieve. But the Light Son of God was too fast, and Han Sen&#8217;s
      attempts were lacking as a result. The crowd couldn&#8217;t see any of
      this, but Han Sen was doing something. Subtly, he was preventing the Light
      Son of God from hitting him in the same place twice.
    </p>

    <p>
      Now that Han Sen was familiar with the Light Son of God&#8217;s energy
      flow, his abilities of prediction and formation were getting better and
      better.
    </p>

    <p>
      The Light Son of God&#8217;s body was like lightning, and he repeatedly
      slashed with his lethal white beams. Not one hit Han Sen, but still, each
      evasion was only accomplished by a scant few millimeters.
    </p>

    <p>
      The Light Son of God was flabbergasted, unable to believe Han Sen had
      managed to dodge his attacks repeatedly.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;He dodged it!&#8221; Hua Ping&#8217;s eyes brightened. This was the
      first time he had seen Han Sen dodge the Light Son of God&#8217;s attacks.
    </p>

    <p>
      Teng Zhen Liu and the rest saw him dodge the attack, too, and were all
      shocked. Dollar had taken a lot of damage, and if anything, should have
      been in worse shape now than earlier. But now, after all the damage he had
      sustained, he had managed to evade an attack from the Light Son of God.
    </p>

    <p>&#8220;Dollarcidence?&#8221; Everyone asked themselves.</p>

    <p>
      The Light Son of God was unable to believe what had happened, so he
      started to move again and use the beam to attack Han Sen once more.
    </p>

    <p>
      Everyone who saw his next attack were unable to tell if Dollar could dodge
      it again. Although people believed his earlier dodge was purely a
      Dollarcidence, people were still praying for some sort of miracle to occur
      as they watched the fight.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;He dodged it again; Dollar dodged the Light Son of God&#8217;s
      attack!&#8221; Fang Mingquan was overwhelmed with excitement and leapt off
      his stool.
    </p>

    <p>
      Those who had been disappointed in how the fight had been going up until
      now, suddenly felt the reignition of a warming fire. They were feeling
      hope once more. With wide open eyes, they paid extra attention to the
      arena. As for the girls who shed tears earlier, their salty streams
      ceased. Drying their eyes, they perked up and refocused their attention.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Impossible!&#8221; The Light Son of God&#8217;s face suddenly
      looked dour. His body glowed with a holy light, which slowly consumed his
      entire body. He raised all ten fingers and pointed them at Han Sen. He
      hastily unleashed ten beams as he did so.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen started moving his body like a street-crawling drunkard. He looked
      so very unstable, but within those strange movements, Han Sen managed to
      dodge every single beam.
    </p>

    <p>
      And during Han Sen&#8217;s wobbling, he inched his way closer and closer
      to the Light Son of God. This infuriated Han Sen&#8217;s nemesis, as he
      and his holy-looking body kept casting beam after beam, trying to kill
      him.
    </p>

    <p>
      The crowd&#8217;s eyes opened wider and wider, watching the stage. They
      could hardly believe what they were seeing.
    </p>

    <p>
      The Light Son of God, who had previously looked indestructible and
      flawless in his composure, was now unable to deal damage to Dollar.
    </p>

    <p>
      Although there were still some beams that grazed Dollar, such hits were
      nothing grievous enough to slow his advancement, and nowhere critical on
      his body was dealt damage. The beams didn&#8217;t pierce his body like
      they did earlier, either.
    </p>

    <p>
      The chance of the Light Son of God hitting Han Sen became increasingly
      lower. The holy-looking Light Son of God, who could not previously lose,
      started to tremble. His face hungered for feral violence. His calm
      composure from earlier had now evaporated, and his boisterous look was
      nowhere to be found.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Heavenly Go? Is this Heavenly Go?&#8221; Kill Dollar really was
      Dollar himself.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Heavenly Go can really be used against Light Son of God?&#8221;
    </p>

    <p>
      Someone recognized the skill Han Sen was using, or so they thought. After
      taking a closer look, they noticed how it seemed to resemble Heavenly Go,
      but different in some way. It looked even better than Queen&#8217;s
      Heavenly Go.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;No wonder Queen didn&#8217;t stand a chance against Dollar. Dollar
      is good at Heavenly Go, too; he might even be better at it than
      Queen.&#8221;
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;I thought only Queen knew Heavenly Go. How does Dollar know it, as
      well? And how is his version even better?&#8221;
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Dollar&#8217;s Heavenly Go does seem strange, and it is indeed
      different than the real one.&#8221;
    </p>

    <p>
      Everyone was talking about it, and even Queen looked at the scene weirdly.
      Although it did look similar, she knew he wasn&#8217;t using the genuine
      Heavenly Go, and the difference between the two was something only she
      could tell with absolute certainty.
    </p>

    <p>
      Even if it wasn&#8217;t Heavenly Go, what Queen saw was a skill that was
      better than her own signature move.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;The world has a better formation skill than Heavenly Go?&#8221;
      Queen didn&#8217;t want to believe this, but from what her own two eyes
      were telling her, she had to.
    </p>

    <p>
      If Queen was in Han Sen&#8217;s shoes right now, and used Heavenly Go, she
      wouldn&#8217;t have been able to dodge the Light Son of God&#8217;s
      attacks. What Dollar was doing was unequivocally better.
    </p>

    <p>
      People were perplexed, having seen the tables flip like they had. Dollar
      was getting ravaged earlier, but now, the Light Son of God was unable to
      do a thing. Although Dollar could only dodge for the time being, at least
      he wasn&#8217;t being injured. If he could keep this up, he might have a
      clear chance of winning.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen pushed his Dongxuan Sutra to the max. He used dongxuan aura to
      sense the Light Son of God&#8217;s energy flow and all the while continued
      to evade his foe&#8217;s blisteringly fast attacks.
    </p>

    <p>
      What the others saw was unbelievable. It was as if Dollar could predict
      what move was coming next, and always remained one step ahead.
    </p>

    <p>
      Even the Light Son of God himself was shocked, unable to understand how
      the human before him could predict his every move. It was like the human
      was peering directly into his soul and understood everything he thought
      about.
    </p>

    <p>
      The powerful Light Son of God began to harbor doubt in his heart. When he
      looked at Han Sen, he could no longer retain his look of supremacy. The
      purple-red body in front of him seemed unreachable, and it seemed as if
      his human foe had a thick fog or haze obscuring him from his vision.
    </p>

    <p>
      The Light Son of God suddenly regretted torturing him in the beginning,
      and how he didn&#8217;t simply blow the human away right when the battle
      began. No longer caring for Divinity&#8217;s Bout, all he wanted to do
      right now was kill the human that threatened him. But he couldn&#8217;t.
    </p>

    <p>Now the real fight begins.</p>
