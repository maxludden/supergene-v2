<h2>One Punch to Blow Up a God</h2>
<h3>Chapter 2405</h3>

<p>Han Sen made this wish because he wanted to know which
great-granddad Han Jinzhi actually was. If Han Jinzhi had been an
ordinary man, then he would have already died and left the world.
In that case, God wouldn’t be able to find out where he was. At
most, God would track him back to a gravesite.</p>
<p>If Han Sen’s great-granddad was actually the legendary figure
he’d been told about, then Han Jinzhi had already escaped the
powers of a God once. He must have been really powerful himself.
This man who called himself God should have had a hard time finding
someone like that.</p>
<p>Somewhere in the universe, on a planet, in a certain street, a
fortune-teller was sitting on the road. He was eating noodles,
making loud slurping noises as he sucked them down.</p>
<p>Suddenly, the fortune-teller’s face changed. He accidentally
dropped the noodles onto the ground as he shouted, “Who is tricking
me!”</p>
<p>The fortune-teller’s fingers twitched for a second. When he
spoke again, his voice sounded furious. “That traitorous b*stard
tricked me!”</p>
<p>While he was talking, the fortune-teller quickly pulled
something out of his bag. He bit his middle finger and let a drop
of blood fall onto the item. He mumbled, “What a shame. Getting
this treasure took so much work. When I go back, I’m going to teach
that little b*stard a lesson.”</p>
<p>A Fox was walking down the road, and she saw the fortune-teller
holding an article of underwear decorated with flowers. He looked
as if he was in pain. She stared at him, but the fortune-teller
didn’t even seem to notice. His face remained twisted in
discomfort.</p>
<p>In Destiny’s Tower, the man looked at Han Sen. The images
reflected in his eyes kept changing, but all of them gleamed
brightly.</p>
<p>Han Sen had made a wish. When the wish was complete, the man
could use his power on Han Sen. Tracing Han Sen’s bloodline would
be very easy, as it was just a basic power. It didn’t even require
any special tricks.</p>
<p>As the spell ran, the man considered different ways he could
maximize his earnings from someone making such a wish.</p>
<p>While he was in thought, the image in the man’s eyes kept
changing. The gleam of power in those eyes was constant, but the
images within them began to whirl faster and faster.</p>
<p>“Argh!” the man suddenly screamed. He covered his godly-looking
eyes.</p>
<p>Han Sen frowned and looked at the man. He didn’t know what had
happened. While he was wondering, he suddenly heard a pang! That
man’s eyes exploded, leaving behind two black holes.</p>
<p>From the empty air of the room around them, a god-like voice
laughed darkly. “How dare you spy on me! This time, I’m only taking
away your eyes. Next time, I will destroy your body.”</p>
<p>“No… impossible! How could you be his heir?! That is
impossible!” screamed the man whose eyes had been incinerated.</p>
<p>“Who’s heir?” Han Sen asked the man.</p>
<p>Now he could see the wounds clearly. The holes in the man’s eyes
weren’t flesh; they were rimmed with a jade-like substance. His
eyes were completely destroyed, and there wasn’t a single drop of
blood.</p>
<p>The eyeless man looked creepy. The empty pits stared at Han Sen
as the man gnashed his teeth. “It doesn’t matter if you are his
heir or not. You made a wish, and so, you must pay the price! Plus,
there is no way you are his heir…”</p>
<p>“You haven’t told me where he is,” Han Sen said.</p>
<p>“He is where he should be,” the man said sternly.</p>
<p>“This is wrong. You have broken the rules!” Han Sen frowned.</p>
<p>“The rules are simple. I have done what you asked, and so, you
must pay up.” The man looked quite angry.</p>
<p>“What if I don’t pay up?” Han Sen asked, glaring at the man.</p>
<p>“That isn’t up to you,” the man laughed in a grating voice. A
light began to shine around his body, like the aura of some ancient
sky god.</p>
<p>Han Sen’s face suddenly changed. He noticed his lifespan had
been drastically reduced.</p>
<p>Normal creatures in the geno universe couldn’t detect their own
lifespan, but Han Sen had come from the sanctuaries. He could see
his own lifespan.</p>
<p>Han Sen’s maximum lifespan was reducing, year by year. It was
transforming into a barely-visible light and drifting toward the
man.</p>
<p>“If this place wasn’t Destiny’s Tower, you would be giving me
more than just years from your lifespan for destroying my eyes!”
the man seethed.</p>
<p>“That was unlucky. I made a wish and received nothing. And on
top of that, my lifespan is being stolen. These so-called gods are
quite fickle.”</p>
<p>Han Sen was furious, and he had to act. He couldn’t allow
himself to lose any more years. He had already lost a dozen years,
and the man was still sapping away even more. Han Sen didn’t know
how much lifespan the man planned on taking in payment for this
wish.</p>
<p>But now Han Sen understood why the Extreme King didn’t complain
about the consequences of their wishes. A part of their lifespan
was probably taken away, but unlike Han Sen, they had no way of
knowing what was happening. Even if they did notice that something
was different, they wouldn’t know how much of their lifespan had
been stolen.</p>
<p>As his lifespan drained away, Han Sen felt something powerful
activate inside his Sea of Soul. That black crystal armor hanging
in his Sea of Soul suddenly moved.</p>
<p>Without Han Sen’s summoning, the black crystal armor appeared
and floated in front of Han Sen. That black set of armor looked as
if it could absorb all light. It made those who looked at it feel
as if they were in the deepest recesses of hell.</p>
<p>Han Sen froze as he looked upon the black crystal armor. The
moment the armor floated in front of him, his lifespan had stopped
decreasing. His connection with the man had been severed as
decisively as if it had been snipped with a pair of scissors. Han
Sen stopped losing years.</p>
<p>“What is going on? I’ve only taken a dozen years, but it should
have been 153 years… Why is this happening?” The man didn’t seem to
notice the presence of the black crystal armor. He looked very
confused. He turned his eyeless sockets back to Han Sen.</p>
<p>The empty pits that were once eyes stared at Han Sen. He
obviously wasn’t adjusting well to his new handicap.</p>
<p>The black crystal armor, floating in front of Han Sen, lifted
its gauntletted arm. In that moment, it looked more like a real
person than an empty set of armor. It raised its hand and made a
fist.</p>
<p>The black crystal armor walked up to the man, but he didn’t seem
to notice it. When the black crystal armor stepped in front of the
man, the clenched fist suddenly launched in a savage punch.</p>
<p>Boom!</p>
<p>The man’s body exploded. He was like a rock being reduced to
powder in an instant. Beneath the power of that fist, he was
nothing more than dust on the wind.</p>
<p>The man who had called himself God was blown up in a single
punch.</p>
<p>An iridescent power that Han Sen could barely see rose from the
exploded body. Then it drifted into Han Sen.</p>
<p>“Lifespan +1… Lifespan +1…”</p>
<p>Han Sen’s lifespan began to shoot upward. In seconds, he had
earned an additional one hundred years. He was gaining lifespan
much faster than he had lost it, and the process was still
accelerating.</p>
<p>“Two hundred years… three hundred years… five hundred years…”
Han Sen watched his own lifespan increase, and as he did, his heart
began to pound. He felt as if it was going to jump out of his
chest.</p>
