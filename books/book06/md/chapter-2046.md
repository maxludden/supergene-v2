  Han Sen put away the scale and rested. His wounds slowly recovered. He did not plan on returning to the geno universe for a while, and instead wanted to stay in the Alliance for a bit.

The Dragon were looking for him, and although Dragon Fifteen did not know Han Sen would teleport back to the same point he had left, Han Sen still thought it’d be a bit too risky to head back for the time being.

If Han Sen did not show up for a long time, and the Dragon could not find him in the Return Ruin Sea, it was likely they’d believe he had escaped entirely. When they let their guard down, it’d be much easier for Han Sen to slip back in and get off the planet.

The Dragon elites couldn’t guard the Return Ruin Sea forever, so it was only a matter of time before they left.

While Han Sen was in the Alliance, he continued to absorb the deified blood that stained his Blood Feather Knife. It’d be great if he could become a Marquise while gone. It’d greatly increase his odds of making it out of the Return Ruin Sea when he went back.

“Come here, my baby. Let Daddy hug you.” Han Sen picked Han Ling’er up off her bed and kissed her.

Han Ling’er used her hands to touch Han Sen’s face. It seemed as if she didn’t like it.

“You’ve been gone for so long, Little Ling’er isn’t going to remember you,” Ji Yanran complained.

“Then I should stay here more. I won’t go back for a while.” Han Sen didn’t tell her that he had been chased. He didn’t want to worry his family.

Family life wasn’t as good as Han Sen thought it would be, though. Changing nappies, bottle feeding, and guessing Han Linker’s thoughts wasn’t easy.

Babies were monsters no one could communicate with. Although Han Ling’er was very quiet for a child and did not cry, she still gave him a lot of trouble.

It was impossible to know what she wanted. Her resting times were different from his, too. Whenever Han Sen sought rest, her eyes would shoot open and she’d want to play.

Now Han Sen knew how difficult it was for Ji Yanran. Guessing what a kid wanted was much harder than predicting the moves of an opponent.

No one dared make Han Ling’er mad, either. If she activated her super god spirit mode, she could potentially blow up the entire planet.

Han Ling’er loved to sunbathe, and she was curious about the world. Han Sen loved taking his airship out to sightsee with her.

“She is so young, and she does not like to stay at home. When she grows up, she is going to run away,” Han Sen thought to himself. He was not upset by this, however.

It was rare for Han Sen to stay in the Alliance for a significant amount of time. He called on his family, and Bao’er, to join him for a vacation.

Han Sen wanted to visit a spa on Planet Ice, but Ling’er loved to be out in the sun. So, he had to cancel that. He went to Planet Sea instead, which had many beaches and lots of sun. There were many creatures there, too.

Bao’er and Ling’er built sandcastles together, while Han Sen and Ji Yanran lay on deck chairs to enjoy the sea wind. Luolan and Han Yufei went diving.

The family was enjoying their vacation when two young boys approached. Behind them was an escort of bodyguards.

The two boys looked to be about the same height as Bao’er, and they were around the age of five. One walked with pride, as if he was the boss. The other boy was very quiet. He walked next to the proud boy, looking rather harmless.

The two boys went up to Bao’er and Ling’er. The proud boy looked at Bao’er and snapped his fingers. The bodyguard then brought out pretty gemstones, high tech toys, and flowers to present to Bao’er.

“Pretty lady, come and be my girlfriend, and all these are yours.” The proud little boy pointed at a luxurious airship, hovering just above the sea.

Bao’er and Ling’er looked at the boy. Then, Bao’er blinked and said, “That’s all you’re offering?”

Tell me whatever you desire, then. My name is Ning Buao. I have nothing but money. If you agree to be my girlfriend, I can give you everything you want,” the little boy said.

“I would like to see fish fly in the sky.” Bao’er blinked.

“What?” The little boy was confused.

For some reason, the quiet boy stepped further away.

“Like this!” Bao’er said. Then she grabbed the bad boy and threw him into the sea.

The boy did not fall straight into the water. First, he skimmed across it like a smooth stone.

The boy started to cry, and then a man went to retrieve him from the water. The bodyguards were in shock, and they all moved to surround Bao’er.

“You guys can leave now,” said a man’s voice. The bodyguards stepped aside.

A five-year-old girl having such power was very surprising. Humans had achieved power inside the sanctuaries, but they could not go there before the age of sixteen. What power was she wielding?

To them, Bao’er was something of a monster.

A quiet man and a pretty woman approached. The man told the woman to take the two boys, and then he approached Han Sen.

“Long time no see. Are those your two sons?” Han Sen greeted the man, laughing. Ji Yanran moved to take care of the kids.

The quiet one is my son. The other one is the son of Son of Heaven,” Ning Yue said.

They look like brothers.” Han Sen chuckled, but he was sincere.

“They live in the same environment,” Ning Yue said simply. He then looked at Han Sen and asked, “Is there another world beyond the sanctuaries?”

“Yes.” Han Sen wasn’t going to hide this fact.

“What will it take for you to take me there?” Ning Yue asked.

“Is your life bad now? Do you need something more?” Han Sen asked Ning Yue.

“This is not the life we should have,” Ning Yue said.

“But you cannot come back. You will not be able to see your family, and you will face death at every turn. Do you still wish to go?” Han Sen asked Ning Yue.

“I am willing to.” Ning Yue answered with those four words.

Han Sen looked at Ning Yue, and then he smiled. “Give me some time. I will need to prepare.”

They stopped talking, and they looked out to the sea together.

“Your son and your wife are nice. You won’t miss them?” Han Sen asked, after a while of silence.

“I didn’t get married. I adopted Little Shi. He can take care of himself. He will take whatever he needs, and he won’t take what he is not supposed to.” Ning Yue’s face remained impassive, but his eyes smiled.

Han Sen was surprised. He looked at the quiet boy and the pretty woman in shock.
