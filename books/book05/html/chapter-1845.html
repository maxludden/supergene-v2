<p>“Don’t look. Return to your homes. No one can leave their rooms;
if you do, you will be killed,” Han Sen said. The Barons quickly
returned to their shelters as instructed.</p>
<p>“Deep Blue Viscount, can you tell me what hurt him?” Han Sen
looked at the gaping hole in Wind Viscount’s head, but he was
unable to discern what might have caused it.</p>
<p>Deep Blue Viscount looked weirded out, and he said, “It doesn’t
seem as if he was attacked. It looks to me as if he imploded, or
rather, exploded from the inside-out.”</p>
<p>“Really? What power could cause something like that?” Han Sen
asked.</p>
<p>Deep Blue Viscount fell silent, and he said, “Many people have
the power to do this. Some have the ability to invade the bodies of
others and destroy their opponents from the inside. It’ll be hard
for us to guess who the culprit might be.”</p>
<p>Han Sen nodded and asked, “Do you know of any creatures like
that around the base?”</p>
<p>Deep Blue Viscount shook his head. “We haven’t been here for
long, so no one has been able to venture out too far. All of our
hunting expeditions have taken place around the proximity of the
base. I haven’t seen any like that.”</p>
<p>Han Sen did not ask any more questions. He grabbed a
flamethrower and incinerated Wind Viscount’s body.</p>
<p>A body that died for no reason could not be brought into the
base. Only the gods could tell what might happen.</p>
<p>The body soon became cinders, but there was something that
couldn’t be melted down. Han Sen plucked it out and noticed it was
a black steel feather. It was a foot long and very heavy.</p>
<p>Han Sen tried getting others to burn it, but no matter what they
tried, it couldn’t be melted down. It wouldn’t even turn red with
the heat. It was obviously not an ordinary metal.</p>
<p>Han Sen used a sealed container to store the black feather.
Those who had come into contact with the body were forced to
undergo a scan and a proper disinfectant cycle, to ensure there
would be no further problems.</p>
<p>But on the second day, something happened inside the base.</p>
<p>The Barons that had touched the dead body had a weird,
egg-shaped symbol on their foreheads. The symbols were black. Han
Sen used a tool to scan them, but there was nothing overtly strange
about them. They seemed to be ordinary markings.</p>
<p>The four Barons were terrified. Wind Viscount’s manner of death
had been far too strange, and now, this unexplainable happening
gave them quite the scare.</p>
<p>Han Sen checked over their bodies thoroughly, but he couldn’t
discern anything out of the ordinary. So, Han Sen had them put into
isolation. Han Sen also made sure to tell the people that delivered
their resources about what was going on. He told them to bring
doctors and tools so that they could try to discover what was
happening to his people.</p>
<p>It would take two days for the ship to arrive, and Han Sen hoped
nothing would happen in the meantime.</p>
<p>“Do any of you know where Wind Viscount had gone off to?” Han
Sen was investigating his death. If he learned how he died, perhaps
he could find out what was wrong with the Barons.</p>
<p>One Baron told Han Sen that he saw Wind Viscount venture into
the northern mountains. Wind Viscount had intended to cross them,
but the Barons with him did not dare follow. Whatever happened to
him was still mostly a mystery.</p>
<p>Han Sen frowned when he heard this. The mountain they referred
to was the one the Earl had gone into and never returned.</p>
<p>Han Sen said he would have to put a stop to people venturing off
to the north. The Nobles themselves knew how dangerous the north
seemed to be, so no one opposed his decision.</p>
<p>Wind Viscount had entered the mountains, but died in front of
the gate. With the four egg symbols on the foreheads of the Barons,
Han Sen didn’t have a good feeling about what was going to
happen.</p>
<p>The Earl had brought many other Earls to help him. And despite
that, they had all disappeared. The people in the base would stand
a much worse chance of surviving anything that might occur.</p>
<p>Han Sen couldn’t wait much longer, so he contacted Yisha for
advice. He wanted to tell her about what was happening, in case the
worst happened.</p>
<p>But Yisha was currently practicing, and he did not know when she
would finish. She couldn’t be interrupted, and so Han Sen was
unable to get a hold of her.</p>
<p>Han Sen contacted Icebird Duke. Yisha had told him that if she
was not around, then he could look for Icebird instead.</p>
<p>Icebird Duke, seeing Han Sen’s number, picked it up. She might
not have liked the way Han Sen conducted his affairs, but Yisha had
told her to take care of him in the event that he required
assistance.</p>
<p>“Icebird Duke, I have a problem. I need to get in touch with the
queen, but she is busy. Do you think you can help, instead?” Han
Sen asked her.</p>
<p>“The rules of the Rebate dictate that only the master of the
planet can contribute to the development of the assigned planet. If
outsiders interfere, there is every chance that we will take it
back from you.” Icebird Duke did not like Han Sen’s attitude,
particularly in the way he kept asking for Queen.</p>
<p>“If this was a normal situation, I wouldn’t come looking for
you. Something bad has happened here, and I can’t get to the bottom
of it. I really do need your help.” Han Sen said.</p>
<p>“If you don’t think you can resolve the issue, then don’t. If
you prefer to, you could always come on back. I can’t help you with
anything.” She stopped Han Sen and went on to say, “Think about it.
If you do decide to come back, I will send out some ships to come
and pick you up.”</p>
<p>After hanging up, Icebird Duke spoke to herself. “Of course
there will be trouble developing a planet. If you cannot do it,
then don’t.”</p>
<p>Han Sen frowned. There was nothing he could do about her, and he
did not know when Yisha would be able to return the call. Whenever
it was, it would be too late.</p>
<p>Han Sen called up another number. He was contacting Black
Steel.</p>
<p>Black Steel was a strange fellow, but Han Sen figured that he
was a reliable sort.</p>
<p>On Planet Knifegrave, Han Sen had asked him why he blocked the
kniferiver. He said he wanted Han Sen to escape. He wanted to
provide Han Sen a chance. He figured that was something he owed Han
Sen.</p>
<p>Han Sen did not know what Black Steel had been thinking, but it
made him feel safe. Han Sen asked him to keep the knifemind thing a
secret. No one knew he had a knifemind as wondrous as the one he
did, and Black Steel really hadn’t said a word.</p>
<p>Han Sen, unable to find anyone else to help, got in touch with
Black Steel. If Black Steel could not help, then he’d have no
choice but to evacuate.</p>
<p>Han Sen was not creating drama. It was best to prepare for an
event or problem one could not overcome. He didn’t want the women
or children that were on the planet to die there.</p>
<p>“What is it?” said Black Steel’s voice, and it sounded exactly
the same as the first time they met.</p>
<p>“I have a problem, and I need your help.” Han Sen went on to
tell him the entire story.</p>
<p>Black Steel let Han Sen tell him everything. After a momentary
pause, he said, “Don’t leave the base, and keep your eyes on those
Barons. And do not touch them, no matter what. I will be there in
four and a half hours.”</p>
<p>“Don’t look. Return to your homes. No one can leave their rooms;
if you do, you will be killed,” Han Sen said. The Barons quickly
returned to their shelters as instructed.</p>
<p>“Deep Blue Viscount, can you tell me what hurt him?” Han Sen
