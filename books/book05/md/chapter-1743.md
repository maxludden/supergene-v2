  Han Sen observed his blood and vessels. He wasn’t even sure if it could still be called blood, though, because the red liquid had become crystal like a ruby. His heart and vessels had stopped working. They didn’t want to stop, but they too had become like rubies. They wouldn’t animate.

If Han Sen had an electrocardiogram, the inside of his body would look like a ruby spiderweb. It was as pretty as it was creepy.

Although his heart, vessels, and blood had stopped moving, the lack of motion didn’t seem to be causing Han Sen pain. He actually felt as if his body was improving.

His blood was healing fast, and his wounds were visibly fading. It was as if they had never existed in the first place.

Han Sen didn’t feel any pain now, and in fact, he felt very energized. He felt as if he could annihilate an entire galaxy with a single punch.

“Did I become a xenogeneic?” Han Sen clenched his fist. The energy coursing through him felt good, but he didn’t fancy the prospect of killing anyone.

Han Sen felt a strange power fill him up. He wanted to spend some time examining the feeling, but Bao’er jumped up to him and disrupted his concentration.

Han Sen held her. She didn’t seem to have changed much. Aside from the gold dot on her forehead, there was nothing about her that was visibly different Han Sen felt a difference in her weight, though.

“Bao’er, are you fatter?” She felt heavier. Bao’er had been with him for a long time, so Han Sen could immediately tell that there was a difference in her bodyweight.

Han Sen put her down and noticed she had grown taller by about two centimeters. It wasn’t much, but she was taller.

“Are you finally growing up?” Han Sen was delighted. Although Bao’er was already a powerful companion, it was still good for her to develop.

Han Sen would be happy with the prospect of her growing up.

“I can grow?” Bao’er looked at her body and seemed confused. She didn’t seem to understand.

Han Sen looked at the vines, next. He noticed that the underworld’s holy vine was dead, with no more energy.

And the gourd was gone, too. But that aside, the underworld itself hadn’t changed.

Han Sen picked up Bao’er and turned to leave. He also told Dark Spirit Elder he could go back and return to his rightful shelter.

“I’m sorry, but I broke the Holy Vine. Take these as compensation for the damage.” Han Sen offered a few Life Geno Essences to Dark Spirit Elder.

The elder didn’t accept them, though. He smiled. “It’s best that it is gone. After this, I now understand that the item was deadly. If it was still there, I wouldn’t dare allow Dark Spirit to remain beside it.”

Han Sen knew the man was speaking the truth. As long as that treasure remained there, Dark Spirit Shelter would never have been safe. And Han Sen couldn’t always be there to protect them. Without the gourd and Holy Vine, this was the best resolution.

Han Sen decided to return to the Alliance from Dark Spirit Shelter. He went home to check on his body. He wanted to know what benefits solid blood might have.

Before Han Sen could closely examine his blood, though, he noticed that the Nine-Life Cat tattoo had vanished.

“Was the Nine-Life Cat absorbed by my blood?” Han Sen checked his own blood, and couldn’t help but be impressed by its beauty.

Han Sen tried running Blood-Pulse Sutra, and when he did, his solid blood began to melt It moved like a living creature as it started to float around Han Sen’s body.

Han Sen was getting stronger and stronger, and the crystallized blood melted more and more quickly. Han Sen felt safer, knowing his blood was not doing any damage to his body.

Then Han Sen turned his attention to investigating a weird power that was rising around him. It didn’t quite seem to belong to him, but the more his blood cycled, the closer he felt to this strange power.

The power, whatever it was, seemed both far away from him and right beside him at the same time. Han Sen could only feel it when he ran the Blood Pulse Sutra to activate his new blood.

When Han Sen’s blood became liquid, it was almost like a new sense was waking up. He could feel the power if he wanted to, he didn’t know what it was. He didn’t want to take any unnecessary risks playing around with it until he learned more.

Han Sen was still with the Luo family, so he planned on visiting the shura. And so, he left. His mom decided to stay with Luo Haitang for a while.

Ji Yanran and Han Yan stayed, too. And so did Littleflower. Han Sen wanted to give him a hug before he left, so he went out into the garden. Before he reached his son, though, his face changed. He teleported toward Littleflower.

Littleflower was sitting on a swing, and a red beast crouched on his shoulder. It looked like a fox, but it wasn’t a fox. It looked like a cat, but it wasn’t a cat. It was Old Cat of the Nine-Life Cat.

“Old Cat, what are you doing here?” Han Sen looked at him darkly. Old Cat had come to see Littleflower, and that did not make him feel good.

Old Cat smiled. “Do not worry, friend. We are good friends, and I won’t hurt you. I just want to borrow your son for a few years, and then return him once he has grown up.”

Han Sen did not say a word, and he just ran towards them.

Before he arrived, there was a red flash. They both disappeared. It looked as if they had been consumed.

“Old Cat, you *sshole! I won’t let you go.” Han Sen was so angry, but they were both already gone.

Ji Yanran almost passed out. Han Sen held her and said, “Don’t worry, if he really wanted to harm Littleflower, he wouldn’t have waited until now. He didn’t take him away secretly, and he wanted to let us know he wouldn’t harm him.”

“Will Littleflower be okay?” Ji Yanran’s eyes looked wet. She was worried because she was a mother.

“Yeah. Don’t worry. I will find Littleflower.” Han Sen continued, shouting angrily, “Old Cat, you *sshole! I won’t let you go.”

When Han Sen said that he would find them, he was not joking. And that was because he had found a way to leave the sanctuary.
