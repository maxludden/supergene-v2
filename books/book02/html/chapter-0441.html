    <p>
      Han Sen did not want to run away anyway. When he used all he got, his
      fitness index was also more than eighty. Even if the two sacred-blood
      creatures were both equipped with physique more than 100, they did not
      have the absolute advantage.
    </p>

    <p>
      Unfortunately, the situation was too risky, so Han Sen did not dare to
      summon the desert bird, afraid that it might be killed by the two
      sacred-blood creatures. Otherwise, his fitness level should be even
      higher.
    </p>

    <p>
      Even so, under the siege of two sacred-blood creatures, Han Sen moved left
      and right, but did not seem to be too awkward. He managed to dodge all the
      attacks from the two sacred-blood creatures without getting hurt.
    </p>

    <p>
      If Yang Manli was there to witness that, she would probably stare her eyes
      out. Among evolvers, maybe only those who had a fitness index above 100
      could achieve that.
    </p>

    <p>
      Although Han Sen did not have the physique as strong as the creatures, he
      was a human equipped with intelligence and techniques. As long as the
      difference was not too huge, it was not hard for him to face these
      creatures.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen had used Sparticle to its extreme. More importantly, the kiting
      skills he learned from Queen turned him into a Go player, leading the two
      stronger sacred-blood creatures into his traps.
    </p>

    <p>
      Ever since he had learned kiting skills from Queen, Han Sen had been
      studying it in-depth. Although his skills were not as good as Queen, he
      had achieved something and become more and more skilled at it.
    </p>

    <p>
      Every step, every turn, and every pause were made with a strong sense of
      purpose. Although it might be too early to tell, the benefits were
      becoming more and more obvious.
    </p>

    <p>
      The spider silk did not touch Han Sen, but caught the claws of the
      blackbird. Flapping desperately with its wings, the blackbird did not
      manage to hit Han Sen, but hit the giant snow spider which was led there
      by Han Sen instead. There had been more and more coincidences like this.
      The two sacred-blood creatures did not manage to hurt Han Sen, but injured
      each other quite a lot.
    </p>

    <p>
      Gradually, the two sacred-blood creatures became mad at each other and
      ignored Han Sen. As they were fighting themselves, Han Sen took the
      opportunity to run away, watching the two creatures fighting from afar,
      while thinking contently, if Queen could see my kiting skills, she would
      probably compliment me on that.
    </p>

    <p>
      At this point, Han Sen was in no rush to run, but observed the two
      creatures fighting it out. Their fitness levels were definitely both over
      100. With their fierce movements, the ice walls and rocks were smashed as
      they went, with crackling and booming everywhere.
    </p>

    <p>
      The blackbird was entangled with the spider silk everywhere and became
      slower and slower. The giant snow spider was also pierced in several
      places by the black bird, its transparent blood flowing nonstop.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Go on, go on. You better kill each other so that I can have some
      free geno points. Although you two are big in size, I don’t mind have some
      extra meals.&#8221; As Han Sen was cheering for the two creatures, he
      thought, the meat won’t get bad in such low temperature, right? I can even
      store it up for a couple of days.
    </p>

    <p>
      Initially, Han Sen thought the black bird would be more fierce, while the
      spider silk was so tough that the blackbird gradually lost its ability to
      move around when it was covered in the spider silk. Very soon, it was
      about to be devoured by the giant snow spider.
    </p>

    <p>
      As Han Sen was hesitating whether he should give the black bird a blow,
      the blackbird quickly plunged into the ice cliff.
    </p>

    <p>
      Because the snow spider had expended too much spider’s silk on the bird,
      it was dragged along down the cliff.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen was dazed and quickly ran toward the edge of the cliff. It was
      foggy down the cliff, so Han Sen could not see what was happening there.
      Nor did he know what had happened to the two sacred-blood creatures.
    </p>

    <p>
      He waited for a while but did not hear anything fall. There was no
      screaming either. The fog was not moving.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;What is happening?&#8221; Han Sen could not decide what to do,
      looking at the cold fog.
    </p>

    <p>
      The two sacred-blood creatures should have all been injured seriously, so
      there was an opportunity for him. However, Han Sen was not sure whether
      they were alive or dead, nor did he know what was underneath, which was
      why he did not dare to go down. However, some godsent fortune would be
      lost if he did not go.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;That’s it. One needs to be daring to survive. These are two
      sacred-blood creatures, so there is no way I should miss this. In
      addition, I am quite capable myself. Even if there was still a
      sacred-blood creature remaining, I could at least escape even if I could
      not kill it.&#8221; Han Sen gritted his teeth and summoned the golden rock
      worm king, flying down the ice cliff on the back of his pet into the cold
      fog.
    </p>

    <p>
      Even Han Sen who had practiced Jadeskin could not help shivering. The fog
      was chilling and moist, even worse than ice. If he were an average guy, he
      would probably need to lie down for a couple of days after traveling
      through the fog.
    </p>

    <p>
      Luckily, Jadeskin had special effects when it came to resist the cold. Han
      Sen sat still on the back of the golden rock worm king with his eyes fixed
      on the bottom of the cliff. However, the fog was so thick that Han Sen
      could not see what was underneath.
    </p>

    <p>
      After a while, the thick fog began to disperse. Han Sen could vaguely see
      something was down there, but he was not sure whether it was the giant
      snow spider or the blackbird.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen ordered the golden rock worm king to fly down a hundred feet more
      and he was eventually able to tell what was underneath. Han Sen stared his
      eyes wide.
    </p>

    <p>
      Both the snow spider and black bird were almost dying, but it was not
      because their previous opponent. Under the huge ice cliff, there was a
      pond of iced water, from which emerged a monster that looked like a squid
      with lots of tentacles. Both the snow spider and black bird were caught by
      the tentacles. Although they were struggling, because of their previous
      injuries or the fact that they were weaker than the monster, they were not
      able to get rid of the tentacles. Instead, the tentacles were getting
      tighter and tighter. Very soon, the creatures were about to be killed.
    </p>

    <p>
      Fortunately, the monster did not seem to have any other means to attack
      other than tightening its tentacles. It could not strangle the two
      sacred-blood creatures immediately. However, it was still just a matter of
      time.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen was dumbstruck by the fact that there were three sacred-blood
      creatures, each scarier than the last.
    </p>

    <p>
      It seemed that this area of ice and snow was far more dangerous than Han
      Sen had thought.
    </p>

    <p>
      Initially, Han Sen thought if he could take down the aristocrat spirit
      shelter, he could do whatever he wanted to this area. However, it seemed
      that he had been too naïve.
