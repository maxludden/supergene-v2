<p>“Can you pull it out?” Han Sen looked at Bao’er with shock.</p>
<p>“I think I can,” Bao’er said with a nod.</p>
<p>“Why did you not do it?” Han Sen was curious as to how and why
Bao’er would resist. That was not her usual way.</p>
<p>“It was because there were baddies.” The bad guys Bao’er was
referring to were Ancient Abyss Grandmaster and the others with
whom he traveled.</p>
<p>“You are very smart.” Han Sen rubbed Bao’er on the head and
said, “There is no rush. On the way back, we can pull out the big
treasure sword.”</p>
<p>Now, Han Sen knew why Bao’er was being so nice on the road. It
was because of Ancient Abyss Grandmaster.</p>
<p>They entered the sea of trash. Han Sen felt as if the radius of
his Dongxuan Aura had been severely reduced. He found it much
harder to sense things. The power of the sea of trash was messed
up. Even Dongxuan Aura was difficult to cast. Dongxuan Aura was
only able to scan up to one mile away. With the messed-up energy
present, it was too severely reduced.</p>
<p>“It is no wonder Ancient Abyss Grandmaster did not want to walk
with me. In this place, no one wants to bring a ticking time bomb
closer.” Han Sen looked around and proceeded forward with care.</p>
<p>There were broken pieces of metal, crystals, and materials
strewn about everywhere. There were also big pieces of machines and
broken buildings, as well as many small things. Han Sen did not
know what most of the things were.</p>
<p>After navigating around a broken giant stone pillar, Han Sen
looked over the trash sea ahead of him. There was an energy ring
that looked like a black hole. It was moving inside the trash
sea.</p>
<p>The black hole was bigger than the planet with the big treasure
sword in it. As they passed by, the trash got sucked in.</p>
<p>Although Han Sen was too far away from the energy vortex, he
still felt the powerful suction.</p>
<p>“That’s a very scary energy vortex. I am afraid if the true god
elites were sucked up, they would be unable to escape it.” Han Sen
left the energy vortex. He did not dare get close to it.</p>
<p>In this place, Han Sen wasn’t about to use teleportation
techniques. He was worried about entering some turbulent patch or
another place like it.</p>
<p>Boom! Boom! Boom!</p>
<p>Han Sen went around the black hole. He saw flickering fireworks
coming out of the trash sea in front. It was like a light substance
flickering. It looked colorful and pretty.</p>
<p>The area with the light substance shining was where trash was
getting ripped apart. It was not forced. It was like a robot
breaking itself down into smaller parts.</p>
<p>“What the hell is this thing?” Han Sen frowned. He saw some
flickering universal cogwheels, but he did not know what those
universal cogwheels were.</p>
<p>While Han Sen was wondering that, he saw a river of flowers on
the other side of the trash sea.</p>
<p>It was a real river of flowers. There were all kinds of flowers
with different colors growing amid the garbage. They coated a
significant portion of the trash, creating a river of flowers that
was 30 feet wide. It was impossible to tell how long it was. The
flower river seemed to go on forever.</p>
<p>This was not a realm with zero atmospheres, but it also was not
somewhere where a normal plant could grow. Plus, there was white
dust everywhere. It did not look normal for flowers to be growing
there.</p>
<p>Han Sen looked closer. He saw a big red goldfish with the head
of a lion swimming in front of the flower river. Wherever it went,
a red light shone. The trash around it had flowers growing in it.
The scene looked miraculous and beautiful.</p>
<p>“True god class xenogeneic?” Han Sen frowned. He noticed the
presence the goldfish released. It was scary. It was sure to make
the hearts of all jump. There was an eight or nine out of 10 chance
that it was a true god class xenogeneic.</p>
<p>The goldfish xenogeneic swung its tail. Wherever it went, a path
was cleared in the rubble. No matter whether or not it was metal or
stone, flowers would grow in its wake. It was swimming toward Han
Sen.</p>
<p>“Good timing. If I kill this true god xenogeneic, my deified
genes will have almost filled up.” Han Sen drew his causal karma
knife and readied himself to fight the goldfish.</p>
<p>When the goldfish drew a little closer, Han Sen discovered that
the goldfish was very strange. Its scales were red. It was unknown
what kind of metal they were made from, but inside it was flesh. It
had the elemental powers of plants. It was really hard to tell what
kind of xenogeneic it was.</p>
<p>As the goldfish got closer, Han Sen thought, “The big barren
systems are really weird. Why do the xenogeneics here have so many
elements?”</p>
<p>Flowers were growing on top of the trash. The pale, white trash
sea looked a whole lot livelier.</p>
<p>Han Sen was ready to swing his knife and combat it, but the
goldfish opened its mouth and spat out some bubbles. The bubbles
were 30 feet long. They gently floated toward Han Sen.</p>
<p>Han Sen’s causal karma knife had purple air. He used Fang to
slash the bubbles.</p>
<p>The bubbles were very thin. It was like one touch could break
them. When Han Sen slashed the bubbles, the knife air went inside.
It seemed to be affected by some kind of power that spun around
inside the bubbles. It was like he had fallen into a vortex.</p>
<p>“Does it have a water element power?” Han Sen was shocked. He
could not determine what the goldfish’s element was.</p>
<p>Seeing the bubbles float his way, Han Sen dodged them and lashed
out at the goldfish.</p>
<p>Before his knife air could get close to the goldfish, the
goldfish spat out more bubbles. There were so many that they
covered the entire area.</p>
<p>Han Sen dodged twice. He noticed that the places where he had
moved had been taken over by the bubbles. He was not able to dodge,
so he pulled out the Shield of the Medusa’s Gaze to shield his
body. He also used Medusa’s Gaze.</p>
<p>The weird woman on the face of the shield slowly opened her
eyes. Some strange light came out from her eyes. When the weird
light touched the bubbles, it was reflected.</p>
<p>The light of Medusa’s Gaze kept being reflected in the bubbles.
It created even more light. Han Sen almost had it on him, so it
made him hurriedly dodge.</p>
<p>Pop!</p>
<p>The places around were taken over by the bubbles. Han Sen had
only just moved a bit when he touched a bubble.</p>
<p>The Shield of the Medusa’s Gaze touched the bubble and went
inside it. Han Sen and Bao’er fell into the bubble too.</p>
<p>Han Sen did not dare use the Medusa’s Gaze. If he used it inside
the bubble, the reflection would have obliterated him and
Bao’er.</p>
<p>Han Sen gathered up power. He clutched his shield with the hope
to rush out of the bubble. He was only able to get close to the
wall before he felt a spinning power make him and the shield slide
away. It was like he was surfing. He kept sliding inside the
bubble.</p>
<p>Once Han Sen flashed away from the wall of water, it stopped. He
frowned and said, “This xenogeneic’s power is so weird. It can
deflect the power of the Shield of the Medusa’s Gaze.”</p>
<p>Pang! Pang! Pang!</p>
<p>While Han Sen was thinking, the bubbles around broke open. Only
the bubble left inside with them was still whole. The goldfish went
in front of the bubble. Its eyes, which looked huge, were going to
touch the bubble. Each eye was taller than Han Sen. The fish stared
at Han Sen and Bao’er inside the bubble.</p>
