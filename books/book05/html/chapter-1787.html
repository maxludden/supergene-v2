<p>“All teams need to reach the battlefield in five minutes! No,
three minutes!” Angry Steel Viscount shouted down the communicator.
His face had turned green.</p>
<p>He didn’t think Greatsword Viscount would be killed quite so
easily. That Baron was pretty scary, and Angry Steel felt so angry,
knowing his men were proving to be so useless against the
attacker.</p>
<p>Usually, this would be fine. But now Mister Ji was watching as
the Angry Steel Army got massacred by a mere Baron and watching as
that same Baron destroyed a strike team. It made Angry Steel want
to dig a hole to hide in.</p>
<p>Mister Ji watched the video feed of Han Sen for a little while
longer, then he turned around and left.</p>
<p>“Mister Ji, please give me another chance! Angry Steel Army will
kill that Baron,” Angry Steel said hastily.</p>
<p>“Keep him busy.” Mister Ji walked out of the camp. He was
looking in the direction of the battlefield.</p>
<p>The maid followed behind Mister Ji, and as she walked, she said,
“Sir, he is just a Baron. You don’t need to challenge the man
yourself. If you want to see him alive, just tell Angry Steel
Viscount to go and grab him.”</p>
<p>Mister Ji laughed and did not say anything. He kept his eyes to
the battlefield as he walked.</p>
<p>After he was gone, Angry Steel was incredibly furious. He was
shouting into the communicator, saying, “I give you five minutes!
Kill that Baron before Mister Ji gets there. Otherwise, you will
all suffer military punishment.”</p>
<p>After shouting, Angry Steel exited the camp and chased after
Mister Ji.</p>
<p>Angry Steel Army’s nine captains did not dare to move slowly.
They all led their teams to the battlefield.</p>
<p>Taurus were supposedly good at fighting and killing. Their
vitality was above average, and their fighting skills were really
good. They were in a rush to get there now, but the formation of
the teams was not a mess. With nine captains, they were all going
to strike at once.</p>
<p>Han Sen had already killed one strike team, and it didn’t even
seem to have slowed him down.</p>
<p>Because there were too many of the centaurs, all racing to kill
the innocents so quickly, he couldn’t chase them away. He had no
choice but to kill them.</p>
<p>Amidst the killing, however, Han Sen discovered something
interesting.</p>
<p>His Dongxuan Armor could absorb power.</p>
<p>Han Sen already knew that it gave him energy to fight non-stop,
but now he was feeling something more in the energy flowing out of
the armor. If the armor usually had one water tap providing energy,
then he could now feel many more open faucets. Han Sen’s life was
stronger, and his power had increased.</p>
<p>This increase happened after he dealt with the strike team.</p>
<p>“Does this mean the Dongxuan Armor absorbs the power of the
earth? Just like my Dollar geno core could when I used Collecting
Taxes. The more creatures there are around me, the more power I
receive?” Han Sen thought to himself.</p>
<p>Han Sen soon received an answer to this. When the nine teams
arrived, Han Sen felt his Dongxuan Armor give a vastly greater
surge of energy. This went beyond merely recovering the energy that
he had lost.</p>
<p>“So it’s true!” Han Sen was quite happy about this discovery,
but he didn’t know if it was a result of his Dongxuan Sutra or his
Dollar geno core.</p>
<p>This was not something Han Sen could ponder now, however. He had
no time, due to nine Taurus Viscounts headed his way. They all
looked pretty passed.</p>
<p>Han Sen was merely a Baron, and even with the Dongxuan Armor’s
buff, he’d still wouldn’t be quite as strong as a Viscount. If he
missed a single strike, things would turn out very poorly for
him.</p>
<p>Lao Zhuoma had watched Han Sen kill Greatsword Viscount. He had
been stunned when that happened, but now, there was a whole army of
centaurs coming. Han Sen was like a small rowboat amidst of sea of
tumultuous waves. It didn’t seem like things would end well for
him.</p>
<p>“Get on the ship, quick!” Lao Zhuoma shouted distractedly at the
Kate still trying to board the ship Mike had seen Han Sen fighting
from the upper deck, and he watched with a complicated
expression.</p>
<p>Buzz!</p>
<p>Before the centaur army reached Han Sen, they all lifted their
spears and threw them at him like javelins. There were so many of
them, they looked like a cloud in the sky.</p>
<p>Han Sen looked up at the spears that were falling like rain. As
he did, the Gold Feather Bow disappeared. His right hand touched
his waist, and when he did, something white appeared.</p>
<p>A white swordlight blazed out from his hand. Under the black
rain of spears, it looked like a sun that was swelling to life.</p>
<p>Han Sen ran into the ring of spears he had cut down, and
wherever he went, countless spears were broken. None of the spears
could cut through his net of swordstrikes.</p>
<p>“Amazing sword skills!” Everyone who witnessed it was
flabbergasted, whether they were friend or foe.</p>
<p>But the Taurus were not going to retreat, and the nine captains
were still leading their teams towards Han Sen. They surrounded him
by keeping their formations tightly knit.</p>
<p>“The sword air travels thirty thousand miles, and one sword can
puncture nine layers of the sky. I thought that any man who can do
such marvelous things must be a swordmaster. But he is just a
Baron. I was certain that he possessed a higher rank… Talk about
shocking.” From a broken building not far away, Mister Ji was
watching the swordlight performance with admiration.</p>
<p>“Very good. I have followed you and have born witness to many
higher races, but none have used such excellent sword techniques as
this Baron here.” Even the maid gave Han Sen a compliment</p>
<p>Angry Steel continued to look terrible. All ten of his teams had
arrived, and all they had to do was kill one Baron. But they were
being destroyed. The sword air cut through his army like a sickle
through field grass.</p>
<p>What made him angriest, though, was that the man didn’t have as
much power as any of the captains. And yet, despite that, the Baron
was invincible. Angry Steel’s soldiers had been unable to do
anything to him.</p>
<p>It was fortunate the person was only a Baron, so he couldn’t use
more swordlights. He could only kill one warrior at a time. If this
hadn’t been the case, thousands would have died in mere
moments.</p>
