<h2>Scary Battle Talen</h2>
<h3>Chapter 2678</h3>

<p>“He has such frightening strength… How many races with hidden
power are there, scattered across the universe?” Li Keer murmured
in surprise.</p>
<p>Han Sen, Dollar, and now Shale—all of them were fierce. And yet,
they weren’t members of high races. In fact, their ancestry was
barely even noteworthy. And yet, they all had crazy powers that
even the Very High had never seen before.</p>
<p>Many of the Very High were having similar thoughts as they
watched the fight. The ordinary Very High, the ones who hadn’t
practiced the Very High Sense, were quite average. None of them
were any stronger than Han Sen or Shale.</p>
<p>The Very High that practiced the Very High Sense certainly had
incredible abilities, but it wasn’t as if the mere practice of the
Very High Sense could give them the level of power that was now
being displayed. When their silkworms became deified, however, they
would gain experience that would lend them a lot of strength and
willpower. Such a process would dramatically boost their
development.</p>
<p>This was the case with Exquisite and Li Keer. Right now, they
weren’t as strong as Han Sen. They couldn’t defeat him in battle;
Exquisite had even failed to beat him when she was a level above
him. But over time, they would learn everything they could as Han
Sen became deified, and it would propel them forward. Although they
would not yet have achieved deified status personally, their minds
would be as strong as Han Sen at deified status.</p>
<p>When Mo Fang realized that he would be unable to suppress Shale,
a strange gleam passed over his eyes. He focused his full
concentration on his opponent, and his third eye tore itself open.
It became a tai chi yin yang eye that shone with crystal
clarity.</p>
<p>The moment the eye opened, Mo Fang’s entire presence changed. He
hadn’t become the lifeless, machine-like being that Exquisite
turned into, but he still wielded a power that would make all who
fought against him cower.</p>
<p>The moment his third eye opened, the three half-deifieds that
were following his mental commands suddenly lurched. Their eyes
lost focus. They became puppets, operated entirely by Mo Fang’s
will. It was like they were merely extensions of Mo Fang’s body,
dancing to his whims.</p>
<p>The three half-deifieds felt sick. They had been selected as
silkworms, yet they had ended up in this humiliating situation. It
was very likely that their masters would end up picking new
silkworms.</p>
<p>The moment Mo Fang opened his Very High Eye, the situation of
the battle was flipped on its head. Shale had regained the upper
hand, but now he seemed to lose it again.</p>
<p>The four silkworms were no longer a group composed of Mo Fang
and the three other half-deified outsiders. It was now a group of
four Mo Fangs. The other three Mo Fangs used their original powers,
but their bodies were entirely controlled by Mo Fang’s mind.</p>
<p>Under that giant tide of pressure, Shale’s eyes looked bright
again.</p>
<p>The fight became insane. The four Mo Fangs had different powers,
and Mo Fang used them to make countless combination attacks. And
now, Shale had no chance to fight back.</p>
<p>Although Shale wasn’t yet losing the fight, he couldn’t find any
way to mount an effective counterattack against his opponents. The
fight continued, and Shale began accumulating wounds again.</p>
<p>At this time, the Fox woman quietly walked over to Han Sen, who
was still in the middle of recovering.</p>
<p>“Ah, Han Sen, Han Sen… You are finally in my paws.” The woman
lifted her hands and placed them on his back.</p>
<p>Han Sen was still practicing, but he could still tell what was
going on around him. He knew every movement of the Fox woman. He
was preparing to stand up and fight her when he heard a shout.</p>
<p>That noise came from Shale’s mouth, and it was like thunder
rolling across the sky.</p>
<p>Although Shale was still in combat with Mo Fang, he had been
keeping an eye on Han Sen’s situation. When he saw that the Fox
woman was making a move behind his back, his eyes flashed. He let
out that lion’s roar.</p>
<p>Suddenly, Shale’s body expanded to become twice as big. All of
his muscles bulged, and a red ball of light manifested like a fire
outside his body. The wavy blonde mane straightened in the fire. He
looked like a lion-headed demon god.</p>
<p>Shale was having a nasty fight against Mo Fang already, but now
Shale’s transformation forced Mo Fang to fall back. His abrupt
retreat threw off his rhythm of attacks. Shale ran toward Han Sen
and threw a punch at the Fox woman.</p>
<p>The Fox woman was shocked. She teleported away, vanishing like a
cloud and avoiding Shale’s punch.</p>
<p>“Shale! Why are you going against me on behalf of our enemy?”
The Fox woman frowned at Shale.</p>
<p>“I told you I would protect him for ten hours. Anyone who
touches him will become my enemy.” Shale stood next to Han Sen,
looking as cold as a demon god.</p>
<p>Mo Fang stared at Shale in astonishment. Shale’s power and
presence were entirely different. He had already been in such a
tough fight, but he clearly hadn’t been using all of his power.</p>
<p>“Mo Fang, how about you and I fight him together?” the Fox
suggested to Mo Fang. She knew she couldn’t defeat Shale by
herself.</p>
<p>“Sure.” Mo Fang didn’t want to lose or abandon this fight, so he
had to take advantage of every opportunity that came his way.</p>
<p>The Fox woman didn’t say anything more. Her body shone with a
red light that solidified into a full set of red, metal-plated
armor. It encased her body, leaving only her tail waving gently on
the outside.</p>
<p>That tail then split into nine. Nine fox tails were swinging in
the air. The pink area then spread to enshroud the space all around
them. Shale’s body was suddenly ensnared by a pink chain that was
barely visible in the haze. It tied up his body, and it looked as
if he couldn’t move.</p>
<p>Without any communication, Mo Fang immediately guided his four
bodies to attack Shale. All of the areas landed on Shale.</p>
<p>When the five half-deifieds came against him, Shale reacted in
utter rage. His eyes were on fire, and his body was like a volcanic
eruption.</p>
<p>Shale roared furiously, and a scary power exploded the binding
chain. His fists were like a pair of fiery warhammers. They
annihilated space and struck one of the Extreme Kings.</p>
<p>Mo Fang guided the Extreme King to raise his arms and block the
incoming strike, but beneath the cruelty of that punch, his attempt
was futile. The man’s area-buffed arm bones were shattered by
Shale’s strike. The fist proceeded to land against the man’s chest,
and it sent him flying away like a meteor.</p>
<p>Pang! Pang! Pang! Pang!</p>
<p>Shale was like an unstoppable demon god. Every punch sent
another enemy streaking away. Mo Fang and the other three silkworms
he commanded hurtled through the air, and none of them had even
been given a chance to fight back.</p>
<p>The punches looked very simple, but things were actually far
more complicated beneath the surface. Only Mo Fang knew that
Shale’s seemingly simple punches somehow subverted all of his plans
to counterattack. It was like each punch was designed to stop
whatever ability he tried to activate.</p>
<p>The four punches were a little different each time. Different
powers were released against the different bodies.</p>
<p>There was only one explanation for how Shale could do this; he
must have known the powers and attack methods of each individual
fighter. That was the only way this was possible.</p>
<p>“Does this mean that while we were attacking earlier, he was
studying our attack patterns? To this level?” Mo Fang thought as he
flew back through the air. His back slammed into a nearby mountain,
and the force of the impact drove the air from his lungs in a
ragged cough. Blood spilled over his lips. He struggled a little,
but he couldn’t get up. His heart was in so much shock, he could
scarcely believe it.</p>
