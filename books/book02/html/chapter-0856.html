    <p>
      The three treasures shone with a golden light, and from each chest,
      something appeared directly in front of Moment Queen.
    </p>

    <p>
      There was a purple shortsword, a small purple hammer, and a small purple
      shield.
    </p>

    <p>
      Hilt and blade combined, the shortsword was about two feet in length. The
      shield was around the size of an average frying pan. The head of the
      hammer was about the size of a fist, with a handle that was barely half a
      foot long.
    </p>

    <p>
      The three items were tiny, and it was hard to guess what use they would
      be. When they exited the chests that initially harbored them, the chests
      shattered into dust and scattered on the wind.
    </p>

    <p>
      When the Devil-Blood King and the rest of the super creatures saw these
      items, they each tried to grab a hold of them.
    </p>

    <p>
      The creature that came closest was the black bull, and with its ten-meter
      long metallic body, it rushed towards them with unprecedented speed.
    </p>

    <p>
      Moment Queen grabbed the small hammer and drove it into the bull&#8217;s
      head.
    </p>

    <p>
      The little hammer did not seem threatening, like a mosquito going up
      against an elephant. The bull paid no heed to its approach, but was
      quickly brought to a stop when they collided.
    </p>

    <p>
      It was like a train that was going three hundred miles per hour had been
      brought to a sudden halt. The black bull stood still, and blood seeped
      from the area of the bull&#8217;s head that Moment Queen hit.
    </p>

    <p>Katcha! Katcha!</p>

    <p>
      The noises came from all through the bull&#8217;s body, as if all of its
      bones were breaking, one after another. The ten meter long body dropped to
      the ground like a crumpled sack. It was very dead.
    </p>

    <p>
      Super creatures, spirits, and humans alike were shocked to witness what
      had just happened. A dreadful, gripping fear had taken hold of their
      hearts, and kept them from moving.
    </p>

    <p>
      The bull was a second-generation super creature, and it was difficult to
      believe that it had been one-hit killed by a hammer.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen and the Devil-Blood King both looked shocked, and they looked upon
      Moment Queen with wide-open eyes, as she hovered mid-air with the three
      articles of weaponry.
    </p>

    <p>
      No super creature moved in response to what had just happened, but Moment
      Queen did. She flew over to the giant centipede that had procured a chest
      for itself.
    </p>

    <p>
      Swinging the purple shortsword, she sliced the monster in half, as if it
      was composed of tofu.
    </p>

    <p>
      The fourth golden chest was in Moment Queen&#8217;s hand. Seeing things
      were getting out of control, Han Sen decided to return Moment Queen to the
      Sea of Soul.
    </p>

    <p>
      But Moment Queen raised the purple shield and encompassed herself in a
      purple light. Han Sen&#8217;s control over her was revoked, and the
      authority of his contract with her had been nullified.
    </p>

    <p>
      Moment Queen merely smiled at Han Sen, and then ignored him. She opened
      the fourth chest, which was a little bigger. A set of armor was inside,
      which Moment Queen immediately donned.
    </p>

    <p>
      Moment Queen was starting to look more and more like some primordial
      demon. She wielded a sword and hammer, as she went over to another super
      creature that was in possession of a golden chest.
    </p>

    <p>
      No matter how strong the super creatures were, they were nothing in
      comparison to Moment Queen. With her shield and armor, any attack she took
      was useless, as well.
    </p>

    <p>
      As Moment Queen&#8217;s smile creeped Han Sen out and soured his
      disposition, Han Sen turned around with a desire to run. He no longer
      wanted treasure; he only wanted to run as far away as he possibly could.
    </p>

    <p>
      Moment Queen was able to use the weapons inside the chests to destroy
      their contract. She had become so powerful, she could slay super creatures
      as easily as one could kill livestock. Without his ability to govern her
      actions, Han Sen was undoubtedly the easiest target.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen had treated her like a maid for so long, he figured that she must
      have despised him. And when she procured the contents of each and every
      chest, he figured that she would come after him. He couldn&#8217;t fathom
      the gruesome manner in which he would be killed.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen was feeling bitter over the circumstances, but no one could ever
      expect that a claimed spirit would have the potential to destroy their
      contract. It was the first he had heard of such a thing happening, and it
      could have quite possibly been the first occurrence in history. Such
      things hadn&#8217;t been recorded to happen even in the demigod sanctuary.
      No one thought that claimed spirits could rebel.
    </p>

    <p>
      And now, it wasn&#8217;t only Han Sen running off. All the super creatures
      had snapped from their daze and chosen to flee, the Devil-Blood King
      included.
    </p>

    <p>
      Not long after, Han Sen had escaped the Purple Mountain. And far-off, in
      the distance, the painful cries of super creatures could be heard. Having
      taken all the golden chests, Han Sen pictured Moment Queen mercilessly
      slaying each and every super creature without reprieve.
    </p>

    <p>
      With Moment Queen&#8217;s speed, she was undoubtedly the strongest being
      in Second God&#8217;s Sanctuary.
    </p>

    <p>
      Now that she had overpowered armor and weaponry, a super creature&#8217;s
      survival in her shadow was entirely dependent on the mercy she was willing
      to offer. Currently, there had been none.
    </p>

    <p>&#8220;Argh!&#8221;</p>

    <p>
      Han Sen heard a voice cry out. He could tell it was from the Devil-Blood
      King, and Han Sen figured he must have been slain.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen&#8217;s determination to escape heightened, and he decided to flee
      even harder. He couldn&#8217;t respawn like the Devil-Blood King could, so
      all he could hope to do was run.
    </p>

    <p>
      But the Devil-Blood King&#8217;s death cry was the last thing Han Sen
      could hear. After that, only the silence sung. The profound quietness
      brought Han Sen discomfort, and when he turned around to take a look, he
      jumped.
    </p>

    <p>
      Moment Queen was standing behind him, silently. She was staring at Han Sen
      intensely, with eyes that were as cold as ice.
    </p>

    <p>
      Aside from the purple armor she was now clad in, she was also garbed in a
      pair of purple, metallic wings and a purple crown. She looked like some
      ancient queen, hailing from some mythical hellscape of a different world.
      She was even wreathed in a purple, flickering flame.
    </p>

    <p>
      Despite the fact she was standing so close to him, Han Sen was unable to
      detect her energy. But still, nothing accentuated her terrifying visage
      more than a crystal-clear image of her standing right before him.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;My Queen, congratulations! It brings great joy to my heart, seeing
      you obtain all this treasure for yourself,&#8221; Han Sen said, as his
      mind raced for a solution on how he might escape his predicament.
    </p>

    <p>
      But no reasonable idea came to him, and fleeing actually seemed
      impossible. The items she had received from the golden chests were too
      powerful, and Han Sen&#8217;s gear would be no match.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;You had fun bossing me around, didn&#8217;t you?&#8221; Moment
      Queen smiled at Han Sen.
    </p>

    <p>
      The smile was so beautiful and radiant, it seemed genuine enough to thaw
      the icy image she was previously conveying.
    </p>

    <p>
      But to Han Sen, personally, it still felt as if he had a bucket of icy
      water thrown on his heart.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen turned around and started running. Moment Queen flapped her wings,
      and appearing behind him, grabbed his back.
    </p>

    <p>Boom!</p>

    <p>
      The silver fox was furious, and it spat out silver lightning. But the
      lightning was immediately cancelled by the purple aura that encompassed
      her body. It dealt no damage. She didn&#8217;t even react to its touch.
    </p>

    <p>
      Uninhibited, Moment Queen grabbed Han Sen and the silver fox. Not willing
      to give up entirely, they both cast their best attacks. Han Sen aimed for
      her belly, while the silver fox aimed for her head.
