<h2>Black-Moon King Visit</h2>
<h3>Chapter 2204</h3>

<p>Han Meng’er and the others finished off the remainder of the
Shadow Bees effortlessly. They managed to collect a lot of
xenogeneic genes through the effort, and many of them earned Shadow
Bee beast souls.</p>
<p>The beast souls were arrows that wielded a toxic fire. When Han
Meng’er killed the second Duke Shadow Bee, she earned a Duke toxic
arrow beast soul.</p>
<p>When he saw the last of the Shadow Bees get destroyed, Night
River King knew his plan had failed. In his rage, he smashed the
screen he had been watching to pieces.</p>
<p>After Han Sen returned to Planet Eclipse and learned of what had
unfolded with the Shadow Bees, he guessed that Night River King had
been behind it. Planet Eclipse did not have any Shadow Bees that
were native to the place.</p>
<p>“Thank God I left the Demon Bug Bai Sema behind. Otherwise, even
though Han Meng’er and the others would probably have survived the
assault, many of my other Nobles would have been killed,” Han Sen
thought, relieved at how things had turned out.</p>
<p>Han Sen knew the bee queen was still around, though. So, he
assembled expeditions to go out in search of it.</p>
<p>The Shadow Queen Bee’s nest was not difficult to find. She made
her home in a large mountain, and the entrances that the bees had
carved were clearly visible.</p>
<p>Many Shadow Bees had been slain only a few days prior, and the
Shadow Queen Bee didn’t produce Shadow Bee eggs fast enough to have
replaced them yet. So, Han Sen entered the beehive easily to locate
the ruby-looking Shadow Queen Bee.</p>
<p>Han Sen perused the information he had compiled on her, and he
knew exactly where she had come from. Seeing the Shadow Queen Bee
now made him a happy fellow.</p>
<p>He recognized instantly that it was a mutant Shadow Queen Bee,
which was a very rare being to procure.</p>
<p>That being said, Han Sen had already guessed that the queen
would be a mutant after hearing about the Dukes that had assaulted
his base. But still, seeing the mutant Shadow Queen Bee in the
flesh made him super happy.</p>
<p>Dong! Dong! Dong!</p>
<p>The Shadow Queen Bee moved incredibly quickly. It flew around
like a solidified shadow, leaving behind trailing shadows of its
own. Her wings flapped so quickly, Han Sen could hardly keep track
of her.</p>
<p>Many toxic lights shone on her back, and they launched
themselves at Han Sen. But each strike just landed on his Bai Sema
and was rendered moot.</p>
<p>“A Duke mutant xenogeneic. So strong! This Duke’s speed and the
toxic light attacks, in combination with the crazy breeding speed…
This would be very difficult to kill without the Demon Bug King
shield,” Han Sen thought to himself.</p>
<p>The Shadow Queen Bee kept flying around Han Sen, firing her
toxic darts. But against the Demon Bug Bai Sema, it was
nothing.</p>
<p>Han Sen didn’t attack the creature, though. He figured it would
be a shame to kill the mutant Shadow Queen Bee. Han Sen wanted to
keep it alive so it could produce more Duke and Marquise offspring.
That way, some of the scarcity of high-level resources offered by
Planet Eclipse could be alleviated.</p>
<p>So, Han Sen hadn’t gone there with the intent of killing the
mutant Shadow Queen Bee. Instead, he wanted to take it and use it
for himself.</p>
<p>If Han Sen had been a Duke, it would have been far easier for
him to claim her. But he was just a Marquise, and his speed and
power weren’t as good as hers. It would take much effort to collect
her.</p>
<p>The Shadow Queen Bee launched attacks at Han Sen furiously, but
they slid harmlessly off his shield. After a while, the creature
exhausted itself. Her attacks became far weaker and far slower.</p>
<p>The Shadow Queen Bee wasn’t an intelligent creature, and it was
a very territorial being. Although it was exhausted, he was still
in her nest, and she would never consider fleeing. She still tried
to fight Han Sen.</p>
<p>Seeing her growing frustration, Han Sen decided to put away his
Demon Bug Bai Sema.</p>
<p>The Shadow Queen Bee, upon seeing the Bai Sema disappear,
flapped her wings to resume attacking Han Sen. She was much slower
now, though.</p>
<p>Han Sen brought out his white Jade Drum and hit it. A very deep
boom of sonic power ripped out of the Drum. It clipped the tired
Shadow Queen Bee and brought her down.</p>
<p>The Duke Jade Drum’s sound shouldn’t have affected a mutant Duke
like her very strongly, but she was too tired by this point, so she
couldn’t withstand the force of that sonic shockwave.</p>
<p>The Shadow Queen Bee dragged herself off the floor, intent on
going after Han Sen.</p>
<p>Han Sen was still holding the Jade Drum. He hit it another two
times. The shockwaves made her roll and writhe around on the ground
again. It looked as if she was in pain.</p>
<p>“If you listen to my commands, I will spare your life,” Han Sen
told the Shadow Queen Bee that was now on the ground.</p>
<p>The Shadow Queen Bee lacked intelligence. When the Drum stopped,
she tried to attack Han Sen again—the intruder that had invaded her
space.</p>
<p>Han Sen didn’t know what to do except continue pounding the Jade
Drum, which made her roll around on the ground over and over. Some
of her bee blood began to pour from her mouth. But Han Sen didn’t
want to kill her. Killing her would be pointless.</p>
<p>Seeing that the Shadow Queen Bee was about to die under his
repeated torture, he decided to exit the hive.</p>
<p>A xenogeneic without proper brains had to be broken-in by slow
torture over time.</p>
<p>Han Sen stationed people to keep an eye on that beehive. If the
Queen Bee made bees, they would go and kill them. That would teach
her a lesson. They hoped that after a while, she might actually
listen to Han Sen and obey his commands.</p>
<p>“We will never be safe for as long as Night River King exists,”
Han Sen thought grimly. He considered how he might dispose of Night
River King.</p>
<p>With the current limits of his power, Han Sen couldn’t go after
Night River King just yet. He needed to become a Duke, and he
needed to own a lot more treasures.</p>
<p>It would have been best if he could use the Blood Scorpion Jade
Drum. That would be the only weapon he’d need to take down someone
that was a higher level than he was.</p>
<p>But even if he was able to kill Night River King, he wouldn’t be
able to do it while he was in Narrow Moon. If they fought, the
Rebate would rally behind Night River King. An outsider would never
earn their favor.</p>
<p>“It looks like I need to become a Duke quickly and find a way to
take him out elsewhere.” Han Sen calmed himself down and tried to
think things through rationally.</p>
<p>Allowing his anger to make him rush wouldn’t solve anything. If
anything, it would just reveal weaknesses for his enemies to
exploit. He needed to be calm if he was going to do this.</p>
<p>“Night River King, I am going to kill you.” Han Sen kept
practicing. The first and fifteenth day of each month, he went to
Cold Palace to absorb moon and cold powers, hastening his ascension
to the rank of Duke.</p>
<p>Han Sen dropped his blood onto the Blood Scorpion Jade Drum
every day, too, slowly letting his essence sink into it. He wanted
his blood to become one with the scorpion. Han Sen felt that he was
slowly building a connection with the Blood Scorpion Jade Drum.
Claiming it would only be a matter of time.</p>
<p>One day, Black-Moon King dropped in on Han Sen unexpectedly.
“Han Sen, the Extreme King will be hiring knights from Narrow Moon.
Are you interested in going?”</p>
<p>“Extreme King recruits elites. I don’t think they’d want a small
Marquise like me,” Han Sen answered, confused. He thought they were
only interested in elites like Yisha. That would require him to be
at least a King.</p>
<p>“The Extreme King will only grow and care for future elites that
are showing great potential. We have a good relationship with them.
When the Extreme King hire knights, they offer a few slots to us.
If you would like to join them, I can get you in,” Black-Moon King
said.</p>
