  “Hm, where did they go?” Qin Xiu looked at Sky King with an unhappy gaze. He was more than glum.

Sky King’s heart jumped. The spirit mirror began to display strange changes. They were no longer in Burning Red Sky. They were actually in another sky.

He finally saw Han Sen, who had just combined with the woman. His body broke space and started to soar through many skies. He was racing through the 33 skies.

The barriers that separated the 33 skies no longer seemed to exist. They were unable to stop the penetration of that scary body.

Within a moment, Han Sen and Wan’er’s combined body came before the geno tablet of the 33 skies. He used his body to pass the 33rd sky. Even the leader in the 33rd sky could not do something like that.

Qin Xiu was in front of the geno tablet. He looked at the transparent body that had been breaking through space to get there. He was trying to find out which of the two souls belonged to Wan’er.

“Qin Xiu.” A transparent body came before Qin Xiu. It appeared and quickly disappeared. It was similar to a flickering light. It was like it was going to be extinguished yet remain gone forever.

“Wan’er, please speak to me! It pains me to see you endure all this!” Qin Xiu looked at the body and asked, “Wan’er? Oh, Wan’er? Are you still there?”

“I… I am…” The transparent body seemed to be wrestling with pain. It held its hair and roared. It was going crazy. It threw its fist into the sky.

A transparent power exploded in the air. It turned into an invisible shockwave, and it was spreading everywhere. It was destroying everything, including the life souls.

Sky King was the first to be affected by the power. With his nearly 100% Break World rate, not even he was able to withstand that power. His body was ripped to pieces. He was going to vanish alongside his soul.

Boom!

Qin Xiu stepped away. The black crystal armor swiftly clad him as he appeared before Sky King. A hand reached out. It was like an invisible wall was coming out of his hands to block the shockwave.

Han Sen’s will started to control the combined body. He saw Qin Xiu and did not hesitate. He threw a punch forward.

An invisible power teleported in front of Qin Xiu. The fist struck Qin Xiu’s black crystal armor, making his body slide away.

Qin Xiu’s face changed. Ever since he had successfully controlled the black crystal armor, he had never been able to feel what it was like for a damaging power to touch him. The strength of Han Sen and Wan’er combined surprised him.

Before Qin Xiu was able to do anything, Han Sen waved his hand and attacked. He felt as if his entire body was brimming with explosive power. It was like one punch was enough to break the sky and the earth.

Qin Xiu froze. He moved his hand and blocked Han Sen’s own.

Han Sen’s body was like a killing machine. He looked at Qin Xiu and used a crazy storm-style attack. Almost every part of his body could do incredible damage, including his finger, hand, fist, elbow, and knees.

Any one of those attacks was able to destroy an average God Spirit elite, but these attacks were still able to be blocked by Qin Xiu’s hands. His hands were like a wall that was unable to be broken. No matter how strong Han Sen’s attacks were, they were insufficient in making him fall back.

Qin Xiu, however, could only defend and not attack. Even so, it gave him the chance to watch Han Sen. Because his body was not entirely Han Sen since Wan’er was still somewhere inside, Qin Xiu did not want to attack.

Han Sen, on the other hand, did not care. He felt his body power was exploding. He was like a volcano that could erupt at any second. If he did not release the power he had now, he felt as if he was going to blow up.

Plus, he was starting to feel as if there was a power encouraging him. It made him really want to break the black crystal armor. It was like a moth drawn to a fire.

Qin Xiu kept blocking Han Sen’s attacks and coldly said, “Han Sen, leave Wan’er’s body alone, and I will permit you to live.”

Han Sen did not say anything in response. He felt as if the power that came from his body was enough to melt his own body. He had to keep going. He had to keep fighting so that he could release the power and make his body feel better.

Pang!

He landed another punch on Qin Xiu’s hand. This time, the power sent Qin Xiu back half a step. The black crystal armor developed a swirl on it.

Qin Xiu frowned. The power of Han Sen and Wan’er combined was already greater than he expected it to be.

When Han Sen attacked again, Qin Xiu moved. He evaded Han Sen’s fist and appeared behind him. He grabbed Han Sen by the neck with his arms. He used a scary power to immobilize Han Sen’s body. His foe was unable to move.

Qin Xiu was behind Han Sen, coldly talking to him. “I demand that you leave Wan’er’s body now! This is the last chance I am willing to give you. Otherwise, I will end your life.”

“Really?” Han Sen’s body flashed away. He vanished from the area, which resulted in Qin Xiu’s power being thrown wide.

When Han Sen’s body appeared again, he was above Qin Xiu’s head. His legs were like a battleax striking down.

Qin Xiu raised his hands to block Han Sen’s strike. A scary power created a swirl in space. The universal cogwheels were broken by the destruction.

Han Sen’s body kept flickering. When he vanished, Qin Xiu’s power could no longer lock onto him. The two of them fought like mad. The 33 skies kept shaking.

Aside from the geno tablet, there were no substances that could withstand their attacks.

Han Sen knew Qin Xiu’s power was scary, but he did not expect him to be that terrifying. He and Wan’er had combined. The power that exploded was greater than what he had. Qin Xiu still seemed fine dealing with it though.

Han Sen even found himself thinking that if it was not for Qin Xiu’s fear concerning Wan’er’s welfare, his situation would have been much worse.

In fact, Han Sen did not know Qin Xiu was actually feeling more shocked than he was.

Qin Xiu was strong, but the reason he was so strong was because of the black crystal armor.

The combined body of Han Sen and Wan’er was just pure body power, and it was now fighting him. Qin Xiu understood that when he was at his strongest, he could not be like that.

“This kind of body power is able to make the first step by using the body.” Qin Xiu’s eyes looked cold.

If that power belonged to Wan’er, Qin Xiu was willing to give up. He would have done anything to help Qin Wan’er.

Now, half of the power belonged to Han Sen, who had asserted control of the body. When Qin Xiu thought of that, his eyes turned even colder.
