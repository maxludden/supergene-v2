  “Bury Path God.” The expressions on Ancient Devil and big sky demon instantly changed.

“Two of my fellow vice presidents came to Dust Sky. You didn’t call. You didn’t write. Don’t you think that is rather rude?” Bury Path God coldly laughed as he spoke.

Big sky demon coldly laughed. “Vice President Bury Path God, you entered the geno tablet. Even if I had wanted to say hello, I would have been unable to.”

Bury Path God did not say anything in response. He went to big sky demon. He knew she and Ancient Devil had found Dust Sky but only hid and sleuthed around without drawing attention to their presence. When he was in the geno tablet, he went looking for where the old leader was buried.

Big sky demon watched Bury Path God approach. She looked shocked. Bury Path God’s power made it seem like he had many real dragons flying around his body. The man seemed to become stronger with every step he took. He obviously wanted to fight her.

“Bury Path God, you and I have never had a grudge with each other. We have never needed to be cross with each other. Why must you do this to me?” Big sky demon was scared, but she still managed to put on a smile.

Bury Path God did not move. He approached big sky demon. He was the leader of Dust Sky. The copper tablet was able to stop Dust Sky’s power, but he was still buffed a lot by the realm’s force. Now, his entire body was like a god. He was becoming even scarier.

“Big sky demon, I do not want to trouble you. It is a shame Mister Leader only left behind one gene seed. I am sorry I was unable to share it with you.” Bury Path God stepped out. Scary powers like a real, roaring dragon were going to big sky demon.

The grey air of countless real dragons was in the copper hall. If that copper hall was not normal and something that was not indestructible, it would have been reduced to dust.

Han Sen felt like his Dongxuan Aura was being broken by the scary power. He could no longer sense much in the copper hall.

Big sky demon quickly stumbled back, splintering into countless phantasm shadows. The shadows exploded. Bury Path God’s power looked like a real dragon. She was like a ghost, ripping through space and escaping toward the door of the hall.

“Big sky demon, you should stay and be buried with the leader.” Bury Path God would not want to unleash a tiger upon a mountain. Scary people like big sky demon would kill him the moment he showed a period of weakness. When she recovered her strength, she would cause a big problem for him.

The scary power Bury Path God wielded covered everything. It buried time and everything else in nothingness. It was like it was able to consume everything.

Big sky demon gathered up power, but the explosive power was much weaker than that of Bury Path God. Seeing the two powers collide with each other, Bury Path God already made a suppressing benefit.

Pang!

Suddenly, there was a scare and cold demon light behind Bury Path God. Ancient Devil was injured. He was dying, but he somehow got up and glowed with gold light. It was like a demon from ancient times. He carried a countless-spell demon hand. He slapped Bury Path God’s back harshly.

Almost at the same time, big sky demon’s power, which had looked a bit weak, suddenly unleashed a shocking display. It was like a sky full of demon air coming.

Bury Path God’s face changed. He wanted to reel back some of his power to deal with Ancient Devil, who had been sneaking behind him, but big sky demon’s weird power surrounded him. He was unable to bring back his power.

Pang!

The powers of Bury Path God and big sky demon were entangled with each other while Ancient Devil was free to strike his back. The three of them were snared together as Bury Path God’s hair waved and danced. His mouth spilled blood. He was fighting the two of them alone to try and grab a hold of the situation.

Han Sen only felt the three powers fighting each other in the copper hall. He could not see the precise details. The three powers were flipping the sky and the ground in the copper hall. It was hard to use the Dongxuan Aura there.

“You guys set me up together. I cannot believe big sky demon and Ancient Devil, the born rivals, would actually work together to deal with me.” Bury Path God was shocked and scared. He thought he had really taken the advantage, but the tables had been turned on him.

Big sky demon did not move. She laughed. “There is nothing I can do because this is your territory. In Dust Sky, killing you has to be done with some flair and creativity.”

Ancient Devil coldly said, “I reincarnated and was reborn. I have only just managed to break the world. Co-operating to fight you makes sense.”

Bury Path God madly laughed. “Even if you guys are co-operating and want to kill me, Bury Path God, such a task is not done so easily. I will just make you both die with me.”

“Why are you doing this? Mister Leader only lets you guard Dust Sky. He did not tell you to go to the Destiny Tablet. You did not even know where the Destiny Tablet’s entrance was. Is it really worth risking your life for something that does not even belong to you?” Big sky demon spoke those words in an attempt to convince her foe.

Bury Path God coldly grunted. “Do you think I do not know that you two are just glorified watchdogs? Whatever it is that is inside there, the leader has kept it for the little master.”

When the words “little master” were heard, Ancient Devil and Big Sky Demon immediately changed expressions. Bury Path God coldly laughed when he saw their faces change. “Do not expect this to be a secret only you two are privy about. I did not live for nothing. Mister Leader risked so much to give birth to that thing. Everything that resides here belongs to the little master. You should both know that we are not qualified to touch it.”

“Teehee. Bury Path God really is Bury Path God,” big sky demon said. “I underestimated you. I did not expect you to know about the existence of the little leader. Yes, this item is for the little leader. So, you have no right to take it.”

When Han Sen heard that, he was shocked. “Big sky demon and Ancient Devil said the stuff here is for Bao’er, and Bury Path God is saying this stuff is for the little leader. Does that mean Bao’er is the daughter of God Chaos Party’s old leader?”

Many thoughts were racing through Han Sen’s mind. “If Bao’er is the God Chaos Party’s leader’s daughter, it now makes sense as to why Rocky Dee and big sky demon do not want the God Spirits to learn about her identity. If so, why are the God Chaos Party people hiding it?”

While he was thinking about this, he heard Bury Path God say, “It is fine if the little leader had the blood of other people, but he has the God Chaos Party’s enemy’s blood. With that identity, how can the God Chaos Party be led? The stuff in the God Chaos Party should not be handled by him.”

When Han Sen heard that, he felt as if his brain had blown up. He finally knew who Bao’er’s parents were. To have said that the God Chaos Party’s rival could touch God Chaos Party Leader meant the only one eligible to fit that bill was God Hall Leader.

“Bao’er’s parents are God Chaos Party Leader and the prior God Hall Leader. Being born to such figures is like cheating. It must be the greatest next-generation being.” Han Sen could not believe his own guessing. Aside from that, he could not think of another possibility.

Han Sen now understood why creatures were always so nice to Bao’er. The strengths of her genes put her on top of the food chain in the main and reverse universes. No other creature had genes better than hers.
