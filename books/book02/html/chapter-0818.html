    <p>
      When Han Sen&#8217;s mind returned, the woman was gone. She had already
      taken the Empty Spirit Witch back through the wooden doors.
    </p>

    <p>
      While the Empty Spirit Witch was in the process of leaving, she looked
      back at Han Sen&#8217;s pack as if she really missed the gourd.
    </p>

    <p>The old wooden doors shut, then disappeared from the sky.</p>

    <p>
      Han Sen had a long sigh. When he touched his forehead, he felt nothing.
      Taking a peek at himself in his mirror, he noticed that the rouge from
      earlier had vanished. It had been replaced with what appeared to be the
      symbol of a lotus; although you&#8217;d have to pay close attention to
      determine what it was. On a passing glance, you would merely assume it to
      be a dot or pimple.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;These assholes! Do they have nothing better to do than going around
      leaving stamps on people?!&#8221; Han Sen shouted angrily.
    </p>

    <p>
      But in the next second, that anger was calmed by the sight of the fruit.
      When he quickly ran towards it, he found that it was ripe and had been
      cracked open. Although the core was gone, there was still plenty of pulp
      for him to gorge on.
    </p>

    <p>
      Before Han Sen flew up to the vine to retrieve the fruit, the Empty Vine
      began to wither. It was dying before his eyes, and as it did, its leaves
      turned yellow.
    </p>

    <p>Boom!</p>

    <p>The Empty Island began to quake, and it soon started to fall apart.</p>

    <p>
      With greater haste, Han Sen soared to the peak and snatched the broken
      Empty Fruit. Then, he took off away from the island for a safer region of
      the skies.
    </p>

    <p>
      The giant Empty Vine started to crumble down to the world below, and the
      island went with it. Great mountains of stone caved in on themselves,
      falling to the lands underneath and crushing the vines that once held them
      aloft. The noise of such natural destruction was deafening.
    </p>

    <p>
      The area soon looked apocalyptic, as if a pillar that once held the world
      up had now buckled under the weight of the life above. It had broken, and
      the world was falling into an abyss of ruined earth and craggy rocks.
    </p>

    <p>
      The giant vine fell and the island went with it. It was like the world was
      screaming, and with the flight of harmony and composure, only chaos would
      remain to take its place.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen soared through the air, watching it all unfold from above. In the
      lands below, a black crater with no apparent bottom was formed. Clouds of
      dust materialized, shrouding the shattered peaks that skirted the
      mountainous region it had collapsed onto.
    </p>

    <p>
      Those mountains buckled and collapsed under the weight of the lands that
      fell on top of them, as well. And it disfigured the coarse highlands into
      a ruinous hellscape.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen waited until all had settled before returning to the lands below.
      He flew down to observe the place where the island had come down. It was
      broken, and its hewn mountains had all but crumbled and disappeared, but
      evidence of its past still remained. Strangely, however, the mountain peak
      where the four fruit were born was wholly intact.
    </p>

    <p>
      The four super creatures were there, as well, standing like sculpted
      fauna. The seedlings on their heads already seemed to be growing
      healthily. Their roots must have coursed deep into the peak, although Han
      Sen couldn&#8217;t guess how far they went.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen took in the sight for a while longer and eventually decided to
      leave. He was wondering if he&#8217;d receive something by cutting the
      seedlings. But if he did that, the vines would become extinct.
    </p>

    <p>
      And Han Sen was concerned about the likelihood of the vine attempting to
      protect itself from would-be ruiners, and so he gave up his idea of giving
      them a shave.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen had already received plenty of rewards from this outing. His gourd
      had been fixed and he had received the Empty Fruit. There was no need for
      him to cut the seedlings.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen tried to nibble a bit of the Empty Fruit for himself, but it was
      like sand. It was impossible for him to consume such a thing. But he knew
      it was quite similar to the Holy Rhino&#8217;s meat, which was harmful
      when he attempted to eat it, as well.
    </p>

    <p>
      The fairy tried to rush out of the shell to greedily consume the fruit,
      but Han Sen was quick enough to stop her and push her back inside.
    </p>

    <p>
      When Han Sen had needed help in the dire situations that had arisen on
      this outing, she hadn&#8217;t helped once. Han Sen was not at all willing
      to give her a share of the spoils.
    </p>

    <p>
      The silver fox started to show some movement, and it clearly wanted some
      of the Empty Fruit, too. He stroked it to comfort it, but summoned his
      Death Knell and brought out his gourd to see if they wanted it first.
    </p>

    <p>
      They showed no reaction, so Han Sen cut the fruit into five separate
      portions. He gave one piece to the silver fox, one piece to the fairy, and
      one to the owl. The last two pieces were given to Moment Queen.
    </p>

    <p>
      Moment Queen had proven herself invaluable and had helped out a lot
      throughout this excursion. Therefore, he wasn&#8217;t willing to go cheap
      on the reward he wished to give her.
    </p>

    <p>
      Moment Queen accepted the two pieces, and after that, the way she looked
      at Han Sen was somewhat different. She believed Han Sen would only be
      willing to give her one slice at the most; she was very surprised to
      receive two.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;If you serve me well, I won&#8217;t mistreat you. You earned
      this,&#8221; Han Sen told Moment Queen.
    </p>

    <p>
      Moment Queen nodded in response and then ate the two pieces of fruit.
      Nothing changed, and so Han Sen returned her to the Sea of Soul.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Where is Little Uncle? Surely he did not get buried beneath the
      carnage of the island that collapsed, did he?&#8221; Han Sen was slightly
      worried by Wang Yuhang&#8217;s disappearance, and went to look for him .
    </p>

    <p>
      As Han Sen was thinking about where he might dig and search for the
      fellow, he espied him in the distance. He was waving.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen sighed and went over to meet with him. He gave him directions to a
      safer place and then returned to Moment Shelter.
    </p>

    <p>
      When Han Sen returned to Moment Shelter, he was greeted with the sound of
      battle. The noises of a fight clashed against the roaring of Little Black
      and Big Black.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Who dares enter my territory uninvited?&#8221; Han Sen ran inside
      and saw the armored phantom fighting the two.
    </p>

    <p>
      Big Black was unable to beat the armored phantom, and Little Black was
      still recovering from its injuries. And now, they were both bleeding
      heavily from wounds sustained in the fight.
    </p>

    <p>
      The armored phantom had seen Han Sen about to be trapped by the vine back
      on the island, so it believed him to have been killed. Therefore, it had
      returned here to take the shelter.
    </p>

    <p>
      It wasn&#8217;t expecting his sudden return, and as soon as Han Sen
      appeared, it attempted to flee.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;You come here, bully my guard dogs and now try to run? I
      don&#8217;t think so. Go get him!&#8221; Han Sen summoned Moment Queen and
      the Little Angel to attack the intruder.
    </p>

    <p>
      The armored phantom was quite powerful, and it lasted a whole hour against
      them before Moment Queen was able to finish it off.
    </p>

    <blockquote>
      <p>
        &#8220;Moment Queen Killed The Super Creature Steel-Knight King. The
        Beast Soul Has Been Gained. The Flesh Of This Creature Is Inedible, But
        You May Harvest Its Life Geno Essence. Consume Its Life Geno Essence To
        Gain Zero To Ten Super Geno Points Randomly.&#8221;
      </p>
    </blockquote>

    <p>
      &#8220;You may retrieve the beast soul from Moment Queen. Take it
      now?&#8221;
    </p>

    <p>
      Without a second of hesitation, Han Sen immediately took the beast soul.
    </p>

    <p>
      One thing about this latest kill stood out to Han Sen in particular. The
      Steel-Knight King was a second-generation creature, and the announcement
      said he was unable to consume its flesh.
    </p>

    <p>
      If a first-generation super creature could not be eaten, its body would
      decompose. Strangely, however, this body remained.
    </p>

    <p>
      The green light vanished, but the armor and greatsword did not disappear.
