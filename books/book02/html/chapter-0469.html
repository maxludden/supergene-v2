    <p>
      &#8220;You are all official researchers in the Alliance. Haven&#8217;t you
      thought about the consequences?&#8221; Ji Yanran frowned at the
      researchers and said.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Consequences? Captain, you are indeed so naïve. Do you think we
      will stay in the Alliance after we succeed?&#8221; A researcher sneered
      with contempt.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;For something inside the Crystallizer ruin, you are willing to give
      up everything in the Alliance without knowing what it is?&#8221; Ji Yanran
      asked.
    </p>

    <p>
      At the same time, Ji Yanran understood that these people had a plan since
      long ago. This was no improvised rebellion.
    </p>

    <p>
      Without a strong support, these people would not dare to do things like
      this.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Ha-ha, do know what is in the ruin?&#8221; The researchers smiled
      at each other, feeling amused.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Just some crystals, right? What else could be in a Crystallizer
      ruin?&#8221; Ji Yanran asked, seemingly puzzled.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Ha-ha, something wilder than your wildest dream,&#8221; a
      researcher said with a smile.
    </p>

    <p>
      Ji Yanran wanted to ask again, but the researchers stopped talking. One of
      them slapped some tape on her mouth.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;You used to be the Almighty Captain, well now you should tread
      carefully. Otherwise, we would not be polite with you.&#8221; After he
      said it, he saw how helpless and beautiful Ji Yanran was, being locked up.
      Feeling tempted, he wanted to touch her face.
    </p>

    <p>
      Ji Yanran quickly became pale, whined through the tape and moved backward.
      However, she was locked, so there was no way to go. The hand of the
      researcher was about to reach her face.
    </p>

    <p>Ouch!</p>

    <p>
      Momentarily, a figure flashed by, and the entire hand of the researcher
      was cut off and sent into the air. The researcher held his broken arm and
      screamed shrilly.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;It&#8217;s you?&#8221; The other researchers saw who it was and
      became astonished.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Who else could it be?&#8221; Han Sen reached out to cut off the
      chains on Ji Yanran&#8217;s body.
    </p>

    <p>
      The researchers quickly took out laser guns, ready to shoot the two of
      them. However, before they pulled the trigger, an elegant woman appeared
      behind them. Sweeping her spear, she knocked them all over.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen dashed forward like a wild beast, throwing one punch at each
      researcher, sending them into a coma without a chance to fight back.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;How come you are here? Where are Li Mingtang and the rest?&#8221;
      Ji Yanran was overjoyed and surprised, throwing herself into Han
      Sen&#8217;s arms.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Since you&#8217;re here, how could I be somewhere else?&#8221; Han
      Sen stroked her hair lovingly and continued, &#8220;They have entered the
      core area. I don&#8217;t believe they will come out anytime soon.&#8221;
    </p>

    <p>
      After feeling thrilled, Ji Yanran walked over to those researchers and
      woke one of them up. She pointed her laser gun at his head and commanded,
      &#8220;Answer my questions. Otherwise, you know the consequences.&#8221;
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Ha-ha.&#8221; The researcher only gave her a strange smile. The
      next moment, blood came out from his eyes, ears, nose and mouth. The guy
      died instantaneously.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen and Ji Yanran were both shocked. All people feared death and would
      strive for survival if there was the slightest chance. However, this
      researcher was so resolute that he poisoned himself immediately, which was
      abnormal.
    </p>

    <p>
      They woke the other researchers up, but the result was all the same. They
      hid their poison somewhere and ended their lives immediately after they
      woke up.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Strange, it is really strange. These people would not even face
      death sentence after they return to the Alliance. They would end up in
      jail most likely. Since they would have a chance to regain freedom anyway,
      why would they commit suicide like this? Something must be off.&#8221; Ji
      Yanran was shocked, watching the dead bodies of the researchers.
    </p>

    <p>
      Even the coldest assassin could not be as resolute as this. The reaction
      of these researchers did not belong to any normal human beings.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Li Mingtang and these people all looked pretty strange. I wonder
      what they are after.&#8221; Han Sen reached out and took out everything in
      the researchers' clothes.
    </p>

    <p>
      Nothing was suspicious. They did not even have many private items. There
      were basically all tools necessary for the excavation work. However, one
      thing caught Han Sen&#8217;s attention. Each of these researchers had a
      cardholder full of different types of crystal cards. Some were memory
      chips, some were credit cards, some were access cards and work permits.
      And there were many membership cards of different corporations and shops.
    </p>

    <p>
      However, among all the cards, one seemingly ordinary crystal card caught
      Han Sen&#8217;s attention. It looked like an access card, which most
      people had a few in their life. Access cards like that opened doors to
      homes or working space.
    </p>

    <p>
      However, each of the researchers carried such a card. Although they were
      of different color and design, Han Sen still could tell it was the same
      access card.
    </p>

    <p>
      Because on the back of the access cards there was a hidden image of a red
      beast with its head and tail connected. It had a look between a cat and a
      fox. Han Sen was more than familiar with this image of nine-life cat.
    </p>

    <p>
      Although the patterns on the back of the crystal cards were complicated,
      the image of the nine-life cat could be spotted on different corners on
      all of them. If not examined closely, it was hard to discern. However,
      because Han Sen was very sensitive about the image of nine-life cat, he
      immediately spotted it.
    </p>

    <p>Han Sen was surprised by this finding and felt quite puzzled.</p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Did you find anything?&#8221; Seeing Han Sen was dazed, Ji Yanran
      squatted next to him and asked.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Nothing.&#8221; Han Sen shook his head and placed the card back.
    </p>

    <p>
      These cards could easily have smart chips installed, so it would be easy
      for someone else to track him down if he took it. In addition, they were
      just access cards and Han Sen had no idea where they led. Each of these
      people had a card, so it was obviously not an advanced card. There would
      probably be no use to take it anyway.
    </p>

    <p>&#8220;What do we do now?&#8221; Ji Yanran suddenly became confused.</p>

    <p>
      &#8220;I want to have a look in the core area again,&#8221; Han Sen said
      hesitantly. If he went inside alone, it would be dangerous for Ji Yanran
      to stay put.
    </p>

    <p>&#8220;Then I will go with you,&#8221; Ji Yanran said decisively.</p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Did you practice Micro Crystal?&#8221; Han Sen looked at Ji Yanran,
      surprised. He was lucky to have succeeded in practicing Micro Crystal and
      become immune to the wandering light. At such a young age, if Ji Yanran
      also succeeded in practicing Micro Crystal, then it would be truly
      impressive.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;I have not practiced Micro Crystal. However, Bone Energy of my
      family makes me immune to the wandering light as well.&#8221; Ji Yanran
      was quite proud.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Are you sure?&#8221; Han Sen had no idea what kind of hyper geno
      art Bone Energy was, so he confirmed it with Ji Yanran.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Otherwise, do you think my family would let me come here?&#8221; Ji
      Yanran spit out her tongue and smiled prettily.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Then we will sneak inside and find out what Li Mingtang and the
      rest are after.&#8221; Han Sen was quite curious as to why the nine-life
      cat dependent would react to this place and why the researchers would be
      carrying access cards with the image of nine-life cat.
    </p>

    <p>All these unanswered questions puzzled Han Sen very much.</p>
