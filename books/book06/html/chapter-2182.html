<h2>Messy Fight</h2>
<h3>Chapter 2182</h3>

<p>The whole of Steel City was a chaotic mess. All the Dukes and
Marquises had been gathered in the city, and the tension was
electric. The different races all suspected one-another, which led
to many conflicts and brawls that served no purpose.</p>
<p>Ultimately, the traitor stayed hidden. And above all, that meant
Han Sen had no choice but to remain where he was. He was not
allowed to leave.</p>
<p>Although the Rebate had been trying to negotiate, the Destroyed
were adamant about not permitting anyone to leave Planet Sodi until
the traitor was found. Those of the other races were not allowed to
leave, and that included the Rebate themselves.</p>
<p>Han Sen believed there to be other individuals mixed up in this,
people who were aiding the traitor in her escape. He thought much
of the current chaos and anarchy was a deliberate concoction to
help the true traitor get away. It was difficult to determine the
truth of this, though. There were no more leads or clues, so
whether the traitor was alone or working with others was impossible
to confirm.</p>
<p>And that was the reason that all the races were suspicious of
each other.</p>
<p>The next day, after Han Sen left his room, the restaurant was
jam-packed with elites again. This time, however, he was unable to
find a seat. Just as he was going to take his meal back to his
room, though, the Feather woman from the day before called him over
and said, “Why don’t we sit together?”</p>
<p>Han Sen glanced over at her empty table. Although others were
keen to watch her, no one dared to actually sit next to her.</p>
<p>Han Sen knew this was because she was a very suspicious
individual. No one wanted to sit with her and risk drawing
attention and trouble to themselves. Their fear was more about the
other elites than the woman herself.</p>
<p>Han Sen did not care about that, though. He had already
interacted with her the day before, so sitting with her again
wouldn’t make a difference. The suspicion wasn’t going to rinse off
that easily.</p>
<p>Han Sen and his companions had just sat down when the Extreme
King lady entered the restaurant. People did not know she was of
the Extreme King, but her slap had made people afraid of her.</p>
<p>The Extreme King woman, having just entered the establishment,
was unable to find a seat for herself. So, she walked to the table
she had used the day before.</p>
<p>There were a few Dragons sitting there that day, though. And
amongst them was Dragon Six.</p>
<p>Everyone saw the woman approach Toxic Dragon Old Six, and
everyone knew immediately that they’d be in for some mid-meal
entertainment.</p>
<p>The Extreme King marched right up to the table and informed them
directly, “I will allow you guys the chance to leave now.”</p>
<p>No one expected that woman to be so brash; after all, no one
spoke to Toxic Dragon Old Six like that. Everyone was very
interested in seeing how he’d react to her.</p>
<p>Toxic Dragon Old Six rolled his eyes and then looked at the
woman with flat eyes. “Why?”</p>
<p>The woman did not speak. Instead, she just punched him.</p>
<p>Toxic Dragon Old Six hummed. His fist suddenly glared with a
green Evilbreaker power, and he lifted it against the woman’s
mighty fist. The two powers thrummed against each other.</p>
<p>But because the two people hadn’t released all their powers,
they both pulled back before they created a restaurant- destroying
explosion. It looked like a tie, though, and neither of the two
seemed willing to back-off.</p>
<p>But Toxic Dragon Old Six’s eyes widened. He stood up and said,
“Let’s go.”</p>
<p>Then, he and his friends quickly left. He allowed the woman to
occupy the table all by herself.</p>
<p>Everyone watched in silence as the woman ordered her meal. No
one could understand why Dragon Six had been so willing to back off
and give her his table. This also raised a few suspicions in
regards to the identity of the woman.</p>
<p>Han Sen knew that the woman hailed from Extreme King, so he knew
why Dragon Six was so willing to walk away. And furthermore, Dragon
Six had deliberately chosen that seat to test her. After that
punch, Dragon Six seemed to fully acknowledge who she was. And so,
he relented. He knew he shouldn’t bother her anymore.</p>
<p>While Han Sen was still in thought, Barr lifted his bone knife
and ran at Han Sen, shouting, “You will die today! Either in here
or out there.”</p>
<p>Han Sen frowned. If Barr had come looking for him, that meant
the man had found a way to resist the cold. Han Sen was not afraid
of him, but he did find this a bit of a nuisance.</p>
<p>Steel City was locked down, so it wasn’t as if he could run away
or escape.</p>
<p>“Barr, do not be so cocky. This place belongs to the Rebate.”
The Rebate manager frowned.</p>
<p>“So?” After Barr said that, he lost all of his patience. He
lifted his knife toward Han Sen while a red and black light amassed
on the blade. When he unleashed that strike, it was sure to slice
the entire hotel in half.</p>
<p>The entire lobby descended into chaos. Everyone in the
knifelight’s path tried to run away. No one wanted to get involved
with whatever was about to happen.</p>
<p>Han Sen kept his seat, though. He didn’t move away, but he did
draw a pistol and fire a shot at Barr.</p>
<p>Barr looked murderous. The bone knife struck the incoming
bullet, though. The bullet was stopped, and Barr was saved from the
gunshot. That knifelight had been so strong, however, that the
strike kept coming. It sliced through the lobby, causing enough
instability in the building to bring the whole place crumbling
down.</p>
<p>Han Sen dodged Barr’s knifelight. And as he did, his pistols
swept smoothly up to point at Barr. He began firing without
reprieve.</p>
<p>Barr was not very good when it came to defense. He didn’t even
bother defending himself, and so the bullets fell on him easily.
The ice light of those bullets began to spread across him, too.</p>
<p>But this time, the ice light was unable to freeze him. A silver
necklace with a gold jewel hung from Barr’s neck.</p>
<p>After the ice light exploded, the gold jewel on Barr’s necklace
began to glow with a lava-looking, gold flame. It melted the icy
force and kept it from doing anything.</p>
<p>“A Light Fireseed necklace!” someone screamed, recognizing the
necklace Barr was now wearing.</p>
<p>When Barr saw that the necklace worked and that Han Sen’s
freezing power no longer posed a threat, he smiled. Then he looked
at Han Sen with rage. He waved his knife and screamed, “I am going
to eat you!”</p>
<p>Han Sen’s heart jumped. He summoned his dragon wings, his dragon
ear wings, and petrified his skin. He flapped his wings, and his
red body teleported away from the incoming strike.</p>
<p>Barr roared. He lifted his knife and ran after Han Sen. His eyes
looked like they were on fire with the desire to kill Han Sen.</p>
<p>The restaurant had been thrown into turmoil. No one knew who
started this all, but everyone was now fighting. And as everyone
fought against each other in a massive brawl, the hotel was rapidly
reduced to splinters.</p>
<p>No one knew where Toxic Dragon Old Six came from, but he was
back, and he threw a punch towards the Feather woman that was near
Han Sen.</p>
<p>The woman flapped her wings and avoided the strike, though.
Toxic Dragon Old Six was unable to catch up with her.</p>
<p>It was possible that he deliberately didn’t go after the Feather
woman, because Toxic Dragon Old Six seemed fine with allowing the
green light shrouding his fist to come down towards Little Angel
and the others.</p>
<p>Little Angel and Zero were able to avoid the strike, but another
few xenogeneics came forward to attack them.</p>
<p>Han Sen had stumbled outside to fight Barr, and he finally
realized what was going on. People were suspicious of the girls
around him, and they wanted to test out his companions. Han Sen
couldn’t believe it.</p>
<p>Neither Han Meng’er, Little Angel, or Zero was the traitor they
were looking for. But even so, it mattered little. If Han Sen’s
companions could be killed, that’s all that mattered to the others.
Somehow, they had just gained a horde of new enemies.</p>
