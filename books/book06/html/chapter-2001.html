<p>After that fight, Sky Palace students frequently debated whether
Han Sen or Lone Bamboo was stronger. The discussions never yielded
any answers, though.</p>
<p>Lone Bamboo had become a Marquise, but Han Sen remained an Earl.
If they were to have a rematch, it wouldn’t be for a long time.
However, Han Sen’s performance in the fight had garnered him much
respect from all of the students of Sky Palace.</p>
<p>The next few rounds of the exam offered no trouble. He won every
match and achieved first place in the Earl class exams. He received
permission to visit the holy house, and there, he found the Under
the Sky knifeskill.</p>
<p>He was also the recipient of more Fenghou Pills and a Marquise
treasure for a prize.</p>
<p>Han Sen’s name was famous in Sky Palace, but he cared little for
the recognition. He focused on practicing his knifeskills at
home.</p>
<p>Yu Jing was super cocky when walking up to the rich men to
collect his winnings. With a smug look, he said, “I brought you the
contract. Did you guys bring the harvest?”</p>
<p>One of the men smiled and instructed his maid to give Yu Jing a
box. He smiled and said, “We did lose. It was amazing to watch, and
it was worth losing this. What you deserve is inside.”</p>
<p>“Thank you.” Yu Jing accepted the box and had a look at the
contents. He smiled like a flower.</p>
<p>Yun Suyi didn’t go looking for Han Sen for a few days. She knew
there couldn’t be a happy ending between them, but she couldn’t
stop thinking about him each day.</p>
<p>After Han Sen took the scroll, he quickly learned the
knifeskill. And just as expected, with his Heavenly Go, Dongxuan
Sutra, and Sky Palace as a base, it was easy to get comfortable
with. He improved a lot in just a few days.</p>
<p>“This knifeskill has a significant flaw. It is not because Yun
Suyi performed it incorrectly.” After Han Sen practiced with it
himself, he quickly discovered the problem.</p>
<p>Han Sen had a decent understanding of Sky Palace’s text. With
Heavenly Go and the Dongxuan Sutra, there was a way he could fix
the problem without having to learn the Textless Book. That way, he
would be able to make Under the Sky nearly perfect.</p>
<p>“If I’m known to hold this knifeskill, when I use the Dongxuan
Sutra and Heavenly Go, people will believe I’m using Under the Sky.
If I’m careful, Yisha won’t think I am Dollar.” Han Sen wanted this
skill badly, and that was one of the reasons why.</p>
<p>Otherwise, he couldn’t use Dongxuan Sutra and Heavenly Go.
Without them, he was a good deal weaker, which sucked.</p>
<p>Han Sen did not see Yun Suyi, and he didn’t make plans to see
her, either. But if he happened to run into her, he would show her
the modified version of Under the Sky.</p>
<p>Han Sen went to the seventh floor of the White Jade Building. He
did not see Yun Suyi, so he settled for absorbing the Jade Air and
leveling up his Jadeskin.</p>
<p>“Brother Han, how have you been recently?” Han Sen was sitting
near an old tree, reading. Yu Jing came flying over on his
mount.</p>
<p>Now Yu Jing looked like a bona fide rich person. The Jade Night
Crane he had used previously was gone, and he was now riding a
green flying dragon.</p>
<p>His armor had been exchanged for a new set that looked
incredibly valuable, and he was also decorated with an array of
jewelry. He looked very powerful.</p>
<p>“Not bad. What do you want?” Han Sen asked Yu Jing, looking up
from his reading.</p>
<p>“Brother Han, I gave you my Fenghou Pills, but you did not use
them in the exam.” Yu Jing smiled.</p>
<p>“You said you gave them to me as a gift for free. Are you saying
you want them back?” Han Sen asked lackadaisically.</p>
<p>“Of course not. The pills belong to you. Why would I want them
back? I am saying there is someone who would like to buy them. When
you reached first place, you received more of them. Would you like
to sell the ones I gave you? The price is handsome,” Yu Jing
explained, making an expansive gesture with his hands.</p>
<p>“I’m not selling,” Han Sen said, then went back to his
reading.</p>
<p>Yu Jing took a peek, and seeing that Han Sen was trying to learn
the regional populations of xenogeneics, he smiled and said, “Ah,
Brother Han. You are hunting xenogeneics? I have a good place you
can go. Are you interested?”</p>
<p>“Oh, tell me.” Han Sen looked at him.</p>
<p>He had been looking for a long time, and he hadn’t been able to
find a location in which he could slay many Earls in a small amount
of time.</p>
<p>Every place had some sort of drawback. Old Night Island’s
monster population was spread too thin, and it was difficult to
find big groups of Earl xenogeneics there. Xuanyuan Cave’s
xenogeneics were hidden, and you usually had to wait for them to
find you.</p>
<p>Every place had a flaw, and not one had large groups of
Earls.</p>
<p>“I’ve seen this pamphlet before,” Yu Jing said. “This is shared
with other students, so of course it doesn’t have the really good
spots. I know of a private island with lots of rare xenogeneics.
They are mostly Earls, too.”</p>
<p>“If it’s private, how do I gain access?” Han Sen asked.</p>
<p>Yu Jing laughed and said, “In the past, you wouldn’t have been
able to get in. But now, things are different. You are Han Sen. At
this point, who doesn’t know your name? Being the Knife and Sword
Master is no joke.”</p>
<p>“Wait, when was I given this title?” Han Sen thought the label
sounded old fashioned.</p>
<p>“No, you’re not the Knife and Sword Master by yourself,” Yu Jing
said.</p>
<p>Han Sen didn’t understand that, so he waited.</p>
<p>Yu Jing, seeing Han Sen’s confusion, coughed and said, “It only
works when you and Lone Bamboo are together. You know of Lone
Bamboo’s reputation here. If the students of Sky Palace put you—an
outsider—on par with Lone Bamboo, you should know how lofty your
reputation has become.”</p>
<p>“So, am I the knife master or the sword master?” Han Sen asked
with a smile.</p>
<p>“Neither. You cannot be separated. You are both the Knife and
Sword Master. There is no Knife Master, and neither is there a
Sword Master.” Yu Jing then changed his tone. “The island I have
told you about is called Rare Beast Island. That island is owned by
the second elder. He treasures it so much, not even his students
can go there. Only those of his bloodline can enter and hunt there.
The elder has a young son called Shi Beifeng, and he admires you a
great deal. He would like to invite you to hunt there.”</p>
<p>“Something that great exists?” Han Sen looked at Yu Jing in
disbelief.</p>
<p>“Of course, but there is one condition. He wants you to help him
capture a xenogeneic.” Yu Jing finally explained the true purpose
of all this.</p>
<p>Rare Beast Island was an amazing place. It looked like one
island, but Nobles of any rank could enter. They’d be teleported to
different places across the island, and it would seem as if they
were actually on different islands.</p>
<p>Only those of the same level could appear at each spot,
though.</p>
<p>Shi Beifeng wanted to capture an Earl xenogeneic for a mount,
but that Earl xenogeneic was special. He had gathered a few teams
to try their hand at capturing it, but none of their attempts were
successful. So this time, he wanted Han Sen’s help.</p>
