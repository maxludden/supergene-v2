    <p>
      Han Sen&#8217;s hand hadn&#8217;t come down on the fairy yet, but
      suddenly, the little fairy blew frosty air towards his face. Ice and frost
      accumulated on his eyebrows, and he shivered from the sudden cold.
    </p>

    <p>The fairy stuck her tongue out at Han Sen and laughed.</p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Gah! How dare you trick me!&#8221; Han Sen tried to grab the fairy,
      but she quickly returned to the safety of her scallop shell. From inside
      its transparent casing, she gave him a mocking face.
    </p>

    <p>
      There was nothing he could do now except return the scallop shell to his
      pocket.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;It doesn&#8217;t seem as if this skill works on fairies.&#8221; Han
      Sen felt fairly bad, but he resolved to test out the skill on someone else
      when he left this place.
    </p>

    <p>
      For the time being, however, Han Sen decided to examine the Devil-Eye
      Spider beast soul.
    </p>

    <div class="tables">
      <table class="beast">
        <tr>
          <th colspan="2">Beast Soul Gained</th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Super Devil-Eye Spider</td>
          <td>(Mask)</td>
        </tr>
      </table>
      <!-- Devil-Eye Spider: Mask-Type Beast Soul -->
    </div>

    <p>
      Han Sen was surprised. Mask-type beast souls were remarkably rare, and not
      particularly useful, either. Ordinarily, mask beast souls could increase
      your face&#8217;s defense and that was it.
    </p>

    <p>
      But this was a mask-soul that belonged to a super creature, and he
      wondered whether or not it might prove to be something rather useful.
      After all, the Devil-Eye Spiders didn&#8217;t seem to have much defense.
      Therefore, Han Sen did not think it was the type of mask beast soul you
      might normally receive.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen summoned the Devil-Eye Spider&#8217;s beast soul, and when he did,
      a strange blue mask appeared upon his face. It was strange and creepy, and
      it resembled a spider that had sprouted golden wings. The wings shielded
      the eyes, whereas the body of the spider covered the nose. Aside from
      that, the rest of his face was exposed. It didn&#8217;t seem very
      defensive, and what&#8217;s more, it obscured his vision.
    </p>

    <p>
      As Han Sen wore it, his vision was tinted blue. Whenever he saw a living
      creature, it appeared red. It was very much like a thermal imaging tool.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;It really isn&#8217;t a defensive mask. What&#8217;s it for,
      then?&#8221; Han Sen took a look at the silver fox who was lying on his
      shoulder and the little thing appeared red as if it was on fire.
    </p>

    <p>
      Looking into the distance to peer at the green-headed flies, he saw them
      as specks of red that were faint and difficult to make out.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen used the mask for quite some time and got a fairly decent grasp on
      what the mask&#8217;s benefits ultimately would be. With this mask, you
      could view the strength of a creature&#8217;s lifeforce.
    </p>

    <p>
      But you could only see the lifeforce, and that was it. The dongxuan aura
      was still better because it could observe the energy flow, as well.
    </p>

    <p>
      Still, it would prove fairly useful. Unlike the dongxuan aura, which was
      limited to its active radius, the mask adhered to the complete reach of
      his eyesight.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;This is a Devil-Eye Spider beast soul, so I wonder if there might
      be any enhancements if I run the Devil-Eye Spider energy flow alongside
      its usage?&#8221; Han Sen then went on to simulate the Devil-Eye
      Spider&#8217;s energy flow.
    </p>

    <p>
      His eyes felt mesmerizingly cool, and he felt that coolness go towards his
      mask. His vision suddenly became much stronger, and the distance to which
      he could see had greatly improved. Furthermore, he could make out
      all-manner of details for distant objects unlike ever before.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen wanted to test the extent of its vision-enhancements, and when he
      did, he was shocked. He was able to observe every single hair on a fly
      that was one kilometer away. Han Sen loved it.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;This thing is far greater than a pair of binoculars. It&#8217;s
      just a shame that the vision is limited to blue and red,&#8221; Han Sen
      thought to himself. Then, he pulled the scallop shell out of his pocket.
      He looked at the fairy and cast the Devil-Eye Spider&#8217;s energy flow.
    </p>

    <p>
      The fairy, as soon as she saw Han Sen, stuck out her tongue at him once
      more. But upon looking him in the eye, her face suddenly became tinged
      with confusion.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Get out.&#8221; Han Sen used his willpower to command the fairy to
      exit the safety of her shell.
    </p>

    <p>
      And then, the fairy slowly opened the shell. But she only opened it
      halfway before snapping out of her daze and closing it immediately. She
      looked at Han Sen with much shock, then turned around to avoid making
      eye-contact with him.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;It works!&#8221; Han Sen had grown really fond of the mask he
      received. If he could confuse a super creature such as the fairy, then it
      had to be remarkably powerful.
    </p>

    <p>
      But despite the grand reward he had managed to obtain, Han Sen was a
      greedy person. He returned to the beehive with a keen interest into what
      else he might claim on this outing.
    </p>

    <p>
      The flies seemed to have snapped out of their mind-control following the
      spider&#8217;s death. They no longer bothered the beehive, and instead
      made their way back to the swamp.
    </p>

    <p>
      Aside from the golden-winged bees and the green fly corpses that littered
      the ground, the hive seemed to have gone back to normal operation.
    </p>

    <p>
      When night fell, the bee king went back to its routine. It emerged from
      the beehive and collected the honey that oozed out from the Chinese Rose.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen could still not figure out what this activity was for. Still, he
      had come up with a plan. The following night, he would command the little
      angel to gather the honey on his behalf.
    </p>

    <p>
      After the next day came and went, Han Sen made his preparations and got
      into position. With the little angel ready to go, he saw the king bee make
      its routine exit.
    </p>

    <p>
      Strangely, however, the bee king looked different on this day. The claws
      of the bee king seemed to be in possession of something. It was an object
      that was shiny like gold, luminous jewelry.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen took a closer look and noticed it was some sort of bee crystal.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Weird. Why is the bee king carrying this bee-crystal thing?&#8221;
      Han Sen was now confused, and so he didn&#8217;t summon the little angel
      as he had planned to. All he did was watch.
    </p>

    <p>
      The weather was nice that night. The moon was big and bright in the sky,
      in complete fullness.
    </p>

    <p>
      The bee king maintained its hold on the bee crystal as it began circling
      the top of the hill. Eventually, it placed the bee crystal down near the
      flower and returned to the hive.
    </p>

    <p>
      Not long later, the bee king came out again. In its wriggly hands, it was
      holding another bee crystal. It placed it down on the same spot it had
      placed the previous crystal.
    </p>

    <p>
      This occurred five times in total, and now five of those bee crystals were
      left exposed on the top of the hill. The bee king returned its hive after
      this and did not return.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen thought it was a most curious sight, and he had no idea what the
      bee king was doing. He looked at the other golden-winged bees and noticed
      that they had all retreated to the beehive and showed no sign of returning
      to the outside, either.
    </p>

    <p>
      Amidst this confusion, Han Sen suddenly heard a strange noise coming from
      someplace in the sea of flowers. It seemed as if something was
      approaching.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen turned around to take a look, and he managed to espy the presence
      of something crawling inside the bushes. Due to the obscuring leaves and
      relative darkness, he couldn&#8217;t make out who or what it was, however.
    </p>

    <p>
      The flowers that populated the area grew close to the ground. If something
      was crawling around out of sight, it couldn&#8217;t have been all that
      big. At the very most, Han Sen imagined, it would be a small snake or
      something. If it were any bigger, the flowers wouldn&#8217;t aid in
      keeping it out of sight.
    </p>

    <p>
      Now, this intruder was making a beeline for the hill. And that was when
      Han Sen caught sight of what it truly was: a baby silkworm that was
      half-transparent. It was indeed fairly small, and its body was like a
      silver crystal. It climbed atop the hill and approached the flower there.
      The bees beneath the hill made no move to attack it.
