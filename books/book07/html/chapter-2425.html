<p>“We can’t get into the city. Talking about it is useless,” Han
Sen said, looking at the undamaged city door.</p>
<p>Night Wind’s power was strong, and it far exceeded Han Sen’s
capabilities. Han Sen didn’t stand a chance of opening Du God
City’s door if Night Wind had failed, and Miss Mirror had fallen to
King class. They really didn’t seem to have any options.</p>
<p>Night Wind’s heart jumped. His sword of darkness slashed again,
but this time, he wasn’t targeting the door itself. He turned his
attention to the rocks all around, planning to dig out the entire
tower that the door was set into.</p>
<p>Han Sen and Miss Mirror stepped back and watched. Since the door
was impassable, they couldn’t think of any alternatives. Night
Wind’s plan was a desperate, last-ditch effort, not a well thought
out strategy.</p>
<p>The dark substance chains kept whipping into the black rocks,
and the rocks were shattered and swept away. More and more sections
of the tower were revealed.</p>
<p>Han Sen didn’t know how many floors the tower had once
possessed, and that was because the tower had actually been cut in
half. It looked like the whole building had been slashed by an
enormous sword. The stone pillars in the front were all chopped
off. The pillars fell smoothly from tall to short, as if it had
been a very tidy cut.</p>
<p>The stone pillars were thicker than a water tank. There were
multiple lines of pillars, and each line contained a dozen of them.
The three of them stared up at the broken tower with wide eyes.</p>
<p>Night Wind wasn’t one of the top deified in the universe, but he
wasn’t weak by any measurement. Attacks backed by his full deified
power were only able to leave small scratches on the city’s bricks.
Cutting a single brick would be far beyond his abilities.</p>
<p>With that in mind, it was difficult to imagine the sort of power
that would have been required to cut clean through this entire
tower. Even thinking about it was frightening.</p>
<p>In the beginning, Han Sen wasn’t very hopeful that they would be
able to enter Du God City from above. Surely such a large and
powerful city would have some sort of bai sema or restrictive power
in place. This wasn’t the sort of place that you could just climb
over a wall to get into.</p>
<p>But now, the tower was broken, and the restrictive properties of
the place must have long been abandoned. That meant gaining access
would be easier than Han Sen had imagined.</p>
<p>The upper half of the city tower was missing. Night Wind slashed
the rocks in various directions, but he couldn’t find the other
half of the tower.</p>
<p>The bottom half of the tower was filled with rubble, and so
Night Wind swung his dark substance chain. He moved the stones out
of the way, clearing a path so the three of them could enter the
tower.</p>
<p>There was little to see in the half of the tower that remained.
A statue had once stood in the tower, but the upper half had been
sliced through and taken away with the top half of the tower. The
part of the statue that remained appeared to be sitting, and its
legs were crossed. The three of them couldn’t tell what sort of
statue it might have been originally.</p>
<p>The shattered remnants of stone beasts lay scattered around the
statue. They had fallen, breaking across the floor. Judging by
where they now lay, it was clear that they had once stood guard on
either side of the statue.</p>
<p>“It looks like a pretty savage battle was once fought here, but
if that is true, how come we haven’t found the corpses of the
creatures that must have died here?” Han Sen asked with a confused
tone of voice.</p>
<p>“Maybe we have. We’ve dug up a few severed arms, remember? Those
limbs were ridiculously dangerous. Even once they had been
amputated, the arms still managed to kill many of our workers. That
certainly shows how scary the people involved in this battle must
have been. Even their limbs possess indestructible power,” Night
Wind said.</p>
<p>Miss Mirror frowned. She looked toward Du God City and said, “If
this is really Du God City, then this must be the sacred place for
the Ancient God. Even the Extreme King have believed that Du God
City was just a legend, not a real place that actually existed. The
Ancient God have protected this city very seriously. If other
creatures wished to attack Du God City, then the Ancient God surely
would have fought back. But I’ve never heard any stories of the
Ancient God having a battle on this scale.”</p>
<p>After pausing, Miss Mirror said, “Based on what we’re seeing,
this is a ruin of a god spirit’s battleground, probably from the
very first era. How did the Ancient God claim it? The Ancient God
might have the word ‘god’ in their title, but they are not actually
gods.”</p>
<p>“Maybe we’re making assumptions about what happened here. This
might not be the ruins of a god spirit’s battleground,” Night Wind
said.</p>
<p>“Even if this isn’t, a fight like this must have shocked the
entire universe. There is no way no one knows about this.” Miss
Mirror shook her head.</p>
<p>Han Sen thought and said, “Maybe Du God City really did exist,
and it was just a forbidden place that was sacred to the Ancient
God. But this city was already destroyed in the very first era.
Maybe that is why no one has actually seen Du God City; maybe the
Ancient God themselves don’t even know where to find it.”</p>
<p>“That is possible. The Ancient God and the Very High are always
so secretive and mysterious. Those two races already existed back
in the Sacred era, and they were already very powerful. But they
were suppressed by Sacred back then. They weren’t as famous as they
are right now.” Miss Mirror nodded in thought.</p>
<p>“If Du God City already existed in the era of the gods, and it
was destroyed at some point afterward, does that mean there are
secrets here that are associated with what it takes to become a
god?” Night Wind sounded very excited.</p>
<p>Han Sen shook his head. “Maybe not. For Du God City to be
destroyed like this, it probably means that the Ancient God failed.
Maybe the secret inside Du God City was already stolen? This might
just be an empty city now.”</p>
<p>Night Wind understood this line of reasoning, but he still held
hopes of plundering Du God City. He said, “No way. There must be
something inside this city. Otherwise, why are other powers trying
to fight their way into the city?”</p>
<p>“It’s hard to say,” Han Sen said quietly.</p>
<p>In truth, Han Sen also thought that there was something inside
Du God City. But that item could be something very different from
the secret to becoming a god. Perhaps some frightening people had
survived the grand battle and were now deliberately luring people
inside.</p>
<p>Han Sen had a bad feeling about this place. They had found a
stone that could turn a deified into a King, and a statue that had
a thousand hands and a thousand eyes. Whatever was inside this
creepy place, it wouldn’t be very nice.</p>
<p>“Let’s head inside for now,” Miss Mirror told Night Wind. Night
Wind went back to breaking up and hauling out the rubble.</p>
<p>The whole of Du God City was buried under an avalanche of stone.
Even the structures and streets were all buried by rock. If Night
Wind and the others wanted to proceed, they would have to move the
stones.</p>
<p>Luckily, all the rocks in the city had already been reduced to
shattered rubble. There weren’t big chunks like what they had found
outside the door. Because of that, they didn’t need tools to break
up the rocks into smaller chunks. They just had to haul out the
shattered stones.</p>
<p>With Night Wind’s powers, moving mountains wouldn’t have been
difficult, so hauling away some rubble was really easy. He didn’t
dare use his power to remove all the rubble, though. He was afraid
of breaking something valuable buried under the stone. Also, on the
chance that something was still alive and sleeping within the city,
he didn’t want to wake it up.</p>
<p>After the experiences that they’d had in recent days, even a
deified elite like Night Wind would treat Du God City with an
appropriate level of respect. He wouldn’t attempt anything
stupid.</p>
<p>Night Wind guided his dark substance chains, sliding aside rocks
that were a dozen meters wide. After going past the tower, they
found themselves in a plaza. Night Wind kept digging, removing one
hundred meters of stone before coming to a stop. He stared at the
place he had just dug up.</p>
