<h2>Opening the Knife</h2>
<h3>Chapter 1927</h3>

<p>Black-Moon King stood quietly on top of the mountain. He drew
out a knife.</p>
<p>Han Sen thought a King class knife would radiate, but the knife
in his hands did not. This was a knife that was narrow like a
crescent moon, but it was black, and it did not reflect a speck of
light. It was as dark as the night.</p>
<p>Han Sen looked at the knife and figured that it was probably
only about three feet long. He wondered why it would have to be
ground and sharpened on a mountain-sized whetstone.</p>
<p>Black-Moon King had not added the finishing touches yet, so he
put his hand on the mountain. And then, the yellowish mountain
produced waves of water. The waves rose at the bottom of the
mountain and surged up towards the top, headed for the peak. They
gathered atop the peak, and atop a rock there.</p>
<p>That rock had a deep groove, and when the water waves reached
it, they poured down into it.</p>
<p>Black-Moon King stood in front of the watery stone. He held two
knives and looked very serious. It looked as if he wasn’t holding
two knives, but instead, two sacrifices.</p>
<p>The black blade was planted on the rock by Black-Moon King. The
knife was fifteen degrees away from the rock, and at that angle, he
began to grind it.</p>
<p>When Han Sen was in the Alliance, he became interested in
blacksmithing. He wasn’t, however, interested in forging knives.
Z-Steel products had to be refined to make them sharp, although
beast soul weapons needed nothing of the sort.</p>
<p>But creating a knife and refining it in the geno universe was
different. A weapon that had been created from xenogeneic materials
could fix itself. That was, assuming it hadn’t been too badly
damaged. But overall, there was no need for maintenance and
refinement. They looked after themselves.</p>
<p>This was the first time Han Sen had seen a xenogeneic weapon
being created. While he wondered what the point of the refinement
was, a light sparked between the knife and the whetstone.</p>
<p>That light was as warm as the sunrise. When you looked closely,
the black blade had teeth marks on it.</p>
<p>Black-Moon King continued refining the knife, his movements slow
and methodical.</p>
<p>The grinding was like the moaning of a newborn baby.</p>
<p>Han Sen was shocked. This was obviously not as simple as
refining a Z-Steel blade, so Han Sen was glad he had come to watch
the event.</p>
<p>Everyone watched intently as Black-Moon King continued grinding
the knife. No one spoke, as they were worried they might interrupt
his focus.</p>
<p>On its third pass over the whetstone, the black knife began to
glow with a strange light. It looked like a jagged moon rising. The
warm and clear light was coming down, and it gave the onlookers a
chill. Everyone felt like they were naked under the glare of that
light, and they imagined it had shaved off all their hair.</p>
<p>After the fourth pass, another tooth appeared on the moonlike
knife.</p>
<p>Every time Black-Moon King ground the knife against the
whetstone, a moon-tooth rose. They were small to begin with, but a
full moon soon started to take shape. And then, a broken moon. And
then, it disappeared.</p>
<p>The moon above the mountain kept changing. A lot of cold
moonlight came down. It was like Narrow Moon and the moonlight were
interacting with each other.</p>
<p>It was hard to see when the moon and the shadows combined. It
was like the whole world only had the knife and the moon left. It
made people feel as if they were intoxicated.</p>
<p>The grinding sounds reverberated in the audience’s ears. Every
time the knife scraped across the stone, moonlight came down from
the sky to imbue the knife with a greater brightness.</p>
<p>From dark to bright, from bright to dark. The strange scene
began to fade, and the knife was sharpened. There was no more
knifelight to observe. It was black, like absolute darkness.</p>
<p>At this time, Black-Moon King pulled the knife away from the
whetstone. It seemed to have been finished.</p>
<p>The water waves on the mountain got smaller and smaller, and
disappeared. The mountain returned to its yellow color. Han Sen
felt strange about this, and he thought, “Has he finished grinding
it?”</p>
<p>As Han Sen was thinking about this, Black-Moon King began
walking down the mountain with the knife. He walked in front of the
pavilions that Han Sen was watching from.</p>
<p>Han Sen could feel nervousness rising from the Kings around him.
Maybe there was some excitement; either way, it all seemed so
strange.</p>
<p>“Moon Wheel, can you open the spirit of this knife?” Black-Moon
King held the knife in both hands as he bowed sincerely before Moon
Wheel King.</p>
<p>Moon Wheel King stood up and said, “If I can open the spirit of
this knife, I would consider it an absolute honor.”</p>
<p>After that, Moon Wheel King exited the pavilion and walked with
Black-Moon King. He accepted the knife from him carefully. Rebecca
and Du Lishe watched their father go to open the spirit of the
Narrow Moon blade. They looked excited, as the other Kings looked
disappointed.</p>
<p>Black-Moon King handed the knife to Moon Wheel King. With great
seriousness, he said, “Please use your Moon Wheel powers to open
this.”</p>
<p>Everyone was in shock, and Han Sen had no idea what was going
on, so he just watched intently.</p>
<p>Moon Wheel King nodded and took the blade in his hands. His body
began to glow with moonlight. Black-Moon King fell back to the
pavilion.</p>
<p>Han Sen looked at Moon Wheel King. He had heard Moon Wheel King
was as strong as Yisha, but Han Sen didn’t really know much about
him. And when Han Sen spoke with him, he didn’t seem remarkable at
all. He was like your average, middle-aged man.</p>
<p>But he was now holding that prestigious knife, tasked with
unearthing the knife’s power. He was basking in the elegance of
radiant moonlight. He was like an angel that had just come from the
sky, and not a single speck of dust could ever fathom touching
him.</p>
<p>The moonlight floated into the black weapon. Its body soon lit
up.</p>
<p>It was not quite shining, as it was just moonlight. There was no
sign of fire, but it felt gentle. It was quiet and warm. Bzzt!</p>
<p>Everyone’s knife began to buzz. They all wanted to hop out of
their scabbards.</p>
<p>Han Sen looked at Ghost Teeth Knife. It did not make any noise,
but it looked hostile. It didn’t seem to be fond of its same
kind.</p>
<p>The moonlight started to get colder and colder, and all the
knives in Narrow Moon were crying. It was as if they were really
welcoming the birth of a new King.</p>
<p>But Han Sen’s biggest point of interest did not rest with the
King class weapon. It was all about the power Moon Wheel King had
inserted into it. Moon Wheel King’s power was pure, unlike Yisha’s.
Moon Wheel King’s power was soft. It did not feel intimidating, and
it would be easy to ignore.</p>
<p>Han Sen didn’t dare underestimate that power, though. In fact,
he felt more alert than usual.</p>
<p>But the reason Han Sen focused on Moon Wheel’s power was not
because he was strong; it was because the power reminded him of
Moon, the geno art Yisha had given him.</p>
