  All the people throughout the kingdoms were in complete shock. An inheritor of a Blood – Pulse from one of the 12 Annihilation God Spirits, God Word King, had chosen not to do battle. It made Ingot, who was the least threatening of the three God of Wealth members, suddenly very popular.

Everyone started to gossip about why God Word King had decided to avoid fighting. They wondered if it was because he didn’t think he could win or if it had to do with something else.

Sky King felt a bit depressed. He had not expected God Word King to give up the fight. He wondered, “Where did God Word King get this news from?”

A middle-aged man, who looked like a scholar, was in God Word King’s manor. He was watering the flowers. He kept watering the flowers while he spoke to himself. “On Sept. 18, which is today, I should not go out, make use of any type of weaponry, or try getting into a fight. I should not do anything of the sort.”

Meanwhile, Bao’er thought this turn of events was very boring. She wanted to play, but her opponent had given up. It upset her.

was

Her feelings of dismay only increased when God Word King completely gave up the fight. The fun she had been looking forward to was delayed.

Since God Word King had given up, no one dared to fight the small flying fish. All future opponents gave up the idea of fighting her, so Bao’er was able to climb the ranks without anything impeding her progress. She did not have to do any more fighting.

Compared to the others, the gold wing peacock king had faced quite a few challengers. The fights were all very close, but the gold wing peacock king was able to gobble up a few more geno races.

Han Sen noticed that the gold wing peacock king was not able to eat just any gene race it wanted. It had to eat bird gene races. It also was able to absorb god-class gene races. As for taking a gene race’s power, that did not seem to be something that was guaranteed. Sometimes it worked, and sometimes it didn’t work. The gene skill it adopted also seemed to be rather random. Han Sen had yet to figure out a pattern for why it did what it did.

Regarding Han Sen, he had been leveling up fine. The blood god dragon with the blood dragon god pulse crushed practically every enemy he went up against. Soon enough, Han Sen found himself ranked among the top 16 fighters. After reaching that rank, he imagined he would get into the top eight before too long. To enter that highest echelon, he had to go up against Zhuo Dong Lai.

Han Sen had heard that person’s name before, but he did not bother trying to find out who he was. He had heard about him simply because the man was too prestigious of a character. Zhuo Dong Lai was a student of Sky Group from Wu Wei Dao Palace. The legends surrounding him claimed that his parents were once being chased, so they sought refuge inside a god pulse. His mother was pregnant at the time, and she gave birth to Zhuo Dong Lai inside that god pulse.

According to the legends, when Zhuo Dong Lai was born, a purple air was released and landed on him. A lot of purple mist seemed to have targeted him. Mysterious text had also appeared. After examination, it was revealed he had been born with a God Spirit Blood-Pulse. Because of that, people called him the man who was blessed by the gods. It led to him receiving the name, Dong Lai. Zhuo Dong Lai was taken in as a student of Wu Wei Dao Palace’s Sky Party Leader, who was the leader of the biggest of the nine sects of Wu Wei Dao Palace. Within a dozen years, he was able to reveal his horns. He was extremely popular and famous in Wu Wei Dao Palace. People claimed he was the greatest student Wu Wei Dao Palace had claimed in more than a thousand years.

Some legends also stated that Zhuo Dong Lai singly fought off students from each sect while they all came at him together during Wu Wei Dao Palace’s nine-sect competition. At the time, he was laughing and chatting as he managed to beat down each of the nine students coming at him. He was then drawn into the skill pool and given the alpha’s inheritor gene race.

There were too many fantastical legends about Zhuo Dong Lai. If someone gathered and wrote down all of the legends, a storybook could have been created.

Han Sen remembering things about Zhuo Dong Lai was not a testament to Zhuo Dong Lai’s legacy and strength. It was because the name held a special memory in Han Sen’s heart.

Back in the Alliance, a demigod association featured a man named Zhuo Dong Lai. He practiced the Purple Manor Sutra. It was one of the hardest Xuan Men geno arts to learn.

Back in the day, Zhuo Dong Lai wanted Han Sen to be a student so he could give him the Purple Manor Sutra. For some reason, there was still this lingering sense that he had always missed a great opportunity. When Han Sen learned that Zhuo Dong Lai had died, he felt sad. He was sad that the Purple Manor Sutra had no heir to learn it.

When Han Sen heard the name Zhuo Dong Lai, it triggered a tidal wave of memories. It was something he could not forget.

In Sky Party, Zhuo Dong Lai was sitting in a stone pavilion. He stared at the fish in the

pond.

An old man, who looked rather dull, came to sit down in the same stone pavilion. He looked at Zhuo Dong Lai, who was perched in a frozen position upon the banister, and said, “Brother Zhuo, you will be fighting Dollar tomorrow. What do you think? Are you sufficiently prepared?”

“No,” Zhuo Dong Lai casually said. His eyes were still fixed on the fish in the water. He did not move much.

“The leader is hoping you will be able to win this next fight,” the elder said with a frown. He was feeling a bit angry, but he managed to keep it down.

Zhuo Dong Lai finally turned around and asked, “What if I am unable to claim victory?”

“You have one of the alpha’s four rare gene races, and you have the purple mist holy clothes,” the old man said. “If you want to win, then I do not see a reason why you cannot win.”

Zhuo Dong Lai coldly asked, “What? Do you mean using a God Spirit gene race in the god fights? Do you want me to make a God Spirit mad?”

The god fights were opened because the God Spirits wanted to test their followers. A God Spirit gene race was like an extension of the God Spirits. Using a God Spirit’s power to fight would likely embarrass the God Spirits. In a worst-case scenario, they could take back the God Spirit Blood-Pulse. That was why no human used a God Spirit gene race in the middle of a god fight.

The purple mist holy clothes were one of the four rarest gene races in Wu Wei Dao Palace. They had already combined with an Annihilation Blood-Pulse. They had become god-class gene races.

The old man wanted Zhuo Dong Lai to use the purple mist holy clothes. There was an 80% to 90% chance that doing so would provoke the God Spirit and incite its wrath. “But Brother Zhuo, you do not care about that,” the old man said with a smile. “So, what? Who cares if you make it mad?”

“Is that really what the teacher wants?” Zhuo Dong Lai calmly asked. “The leader has not said anything, but I suspect he wants you to win, Brother,” the old man said. “After all, you are very talented. You will be the next to assert leadership in the Sky Party. The teacher will want you to do something that can cement your fame and legacy. In that way, when he gives you the throne, people from the other parties will not be able to whisper a single negative word about his decision.”

“If things are truly that way, please go and tell the teacher I will try my best.” Zhuo Dong Lai suddenly looked depressed. He stopped looking at the old man and went back to the stone railing. He cradled his jaw in his hands as he watched the fish swim.

“I hope you succeed, Brother Zhuo, and I hope you become famous,” the old man said as he left. After he turned around, he looked disdainful.

“Famous, huh?” Zhuo Dong Lai lifted his lips. He looked disdainful too.

“That is fine. Maybe this Dollar will be an interesting guy.” After a while, Zhuo Dong Lai stood up. His eyes looked focused. He was emitting some light. In the dark night, there was some weird purple light.

On the day of the fight that determined the top 16, many people had a hard time deciding which fight to watch. Everyone who had come this far was famous across the entire universe. They had all shocked the world in some capacity, and it sucked having to miss out watching any of them.

After hesitating for a while, many people settled on watching the matches that featured members of the God of Wealth. They were particularly keen on watching Dollar’s bout.
