    <p>
      &#8220;It looks like everyone knows who I am. Yet I don&#8217;t know any
      of you. That hardly seems fair.&#8221; Han Sen smiled at the people in
      front of him.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;I cannot believe we stumbled across you here. This truly is
      perfect.&#8221; Manager Qu had murder in his eyes. He looked at the people
      around him, and they spread out to surround Han Sen.
    </p>

    <p>
      There were seven of them, and they looked to be elites who had opened
      their gene locks. Furthermore, they were all under the effects of the
      drug. They possessed an unnatural power, and they were clearly preparing
      themselves to kill Han Sen.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Han Sen, summon your super pet. It&#8217;s about time we
      demonstrate to you that super pets aren&#8217;t that good.&#8221; The
      leader, Manager Qu, looked to be seething with rage as he coldly spoke to
      Han Sen.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Super pets aren&#8217;t good, you&#8217;re right; they&#8217;re
      brilliant. But I don&#8217;t need a super pet to deal with you
      guys.&#8221; Han Sen summoned the Flaming Rex Spike in his hands.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen wanted to see how strong the people truly were, having used the
      shura concoction.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Good. Show us how talented you are.&#8221; Manager Qu seemed
      genuinely excited, and very confident in his ability to kill Han Sen
      before he summoned a super pet.
    </p>

    <p>It would be better if they did not have to fight the super pet.</p>

    <p>
      Without any hesitation, Manager Qu swung his sword as fire erupted from
      the blade and wreathed it. Then, he rushed towards Han Sen.
    </p>

    <p>
      The other six people, who were blood-horned shura, had their elemental
      powers primed. They all raced towards Han Sen, looking as if they wanted
      to kill him quickly before he summoned his super pet. They seemed to be
      really confident about killing Han Sen, and as a matter of fact, they had
      already formulated a plan for killing him beforehand. They had learned it
      on the off-chance they would one day encounter him again. But their plan
      included what they should do to deal with the little angel at the same
      time. Now that they did not have to deal with the little angel right away,
      their confidence was bolstered.
    </p>

    <p>
      They thought Han Sen was a person who relied solely on his super pet for
      strength, and that he wasn&#8217;t all that proficient in battle himself.
      Now that they had used their shura liquid, their power exceeded what they
      believed possible for a human being. Thus, they thought killing him would
      be a trivial task.
    </p>

    <p>
      Seeing the first weapons approach, Han Sen waved him Flaming Rex Spike.
      The rex spike shone with a green light, and without fear, he committed to
      the battle they brought towards him.
    </p>

    <p>
      The green light came from Han Sen&#8217;s simulation of the armored
      phantom. He could simulate it one hundred percent. Han Sen&#8217;s
      lifeforce was not as strong as the armored phantom&#8217;s, however, so
      the light was a little weaker.
    </p>

    <p>Kacha!</p>

    <p>
      The indestructible green light cleaved through every one of his foes'
      elemental attacks. When he reached Manager Qu&#8217;s longsword, Han
      Sen&#8217;s swing broke it with ease.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Impossible! How can you unleash such power?&#8221; Manager Qu and
      the rest of his people were all shocked. They had all used shura liquid to
      increase their fitness to a level that granted them elemental powers.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen never used anything of the sort. With no body-boosting
      concoctions, they had no idea how he had managed to become so strong and
      do such a thing.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Unleashing power is not that good.&#8221; Han Sen waved his Flaming
      Rex Spike towards one of his attackers.
    </p>

    <p>
      The green light spun alongside the Flaming Rex Spike, becoming a green
      light drill bit. The man it was coming for raised his giant rock of a
      shield, in the hopes of blocking the incoming hit.
    </p>

    <p>
      The Flaming Rex Spike drilled through the rocky shield like butter. Its
      speed was not impeded in the slightest, and it cut clean through into the
      man&#8217;s body.
    </p>

    <p>The blood-horn shura roared, as his body began to turn into stone.</p>

    <p>
      But it seemed useless in opposition to the green drill bit. The rocky body
      was of no resistance, and after the drill pierced through, he was
      instantly killed.
    </p>

    <p>
      The faces of his opponents all changed. They did not expect Han Sen to
      possess such a power, even with his super pet. He was far stronger than
      any scrap of intel had informed them.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen waved his Flaming Rex Spike and put his enemies at a disadvantage.
      He was still winning, despite going up against six people at the same
      time.
    </p>

    <p>
      His enemies went all pale. They believed their shura liquid was enough to
      compete against a super pet, but now, they were brought to the startling
      realization that it wasn&#8217;t even enough to deal with Han Sen himself.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;What is going on?! How can Han Sen cast and unleash such power? Why
      is he so strong? Did he find a way to absorb Life Geno Essences? Has he
      become a celestial being?&#8221; Manager Qu was suddenly brought to fear.
      He didn&#8217;t want to fight Han Sen any longer.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Let&#8217;s go. When we return, we must make sure to inform the
      boss that Han Sen has managed to absorb Life Geno Essences. And we must
      tell him that he has become a celestial being,&#8221; Manager Qu shouted
      before running off.
    </p>

    <p>
      Five of the fighters still remained, but they did not stay for long. They
      all took off running in different directions, as fast as the wind.
    </p>

    <p>Han Sen coldly laughed and chased after Manager Qu.</p>

    <p>
      Manager Qu saw Han Sen chase after him but felt relieved. Even if Han Sen
      could catch up with him, the others would have gone far enough away to be
      safe from any other pursuit he sought to give. One way or another, the
      message would be delivered to their boss.
    </p>

    <p>
      But then, Manager Qu saw Han Sen summon a blonde angel and a black-armored
      queen.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;I want two of them alive. Kill the rest!&#8221; Han Sen coldly
      commanded.
    </p>

    <p>
      The angel and queen flew in different directions, and their speed truly
      shocked Manager Qu.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;That kind of speed&#8230; they must both be super pets! You have
      two super pets?!&#8221; Manager Qu&#8217;s heart was shattered into
      pieces. He spoke to himself aloud, acknowledging his underestimation of
      Han Sen.
    </p>

    <p>
      According to the boss&#8217;s calculation, they wouldn&#8217;t have been
      able to kill him even if they had twice the men. Han Sen&#8217;s own
      power, and all the stuff he had managed to collect over time, were far
      beyond their wildest expectations.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;You are wrong. I only have one super pet. The other is a king
      spirit. Oh, silly me. Perhaps you haven&#8217;t heard? King spirits are
      what you refer to as super spirits. They are officially titled King-class
      Spirits.&#8221; Han Sen moved his body and shot right behind Manager Qu,
      with a speed faster than any other human could achieve.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;King spirit?!&#8221; Manager Qu exclaimed in shock, now having lost
      the ability to run. &#8220;It&#8217;s over. It&#8217;s all over! We were
      so wrong.&#8221;
    </p>
