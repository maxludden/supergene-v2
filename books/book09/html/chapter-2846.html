	<p>Han Sen did not watch the next fight. He had to quickly increase his genes so he could become butterfly class. If
		he didn&#8217;t do that, he wouldn&#8217;t stand a chance when it came to fighting top-class deified creatures.
	</p>

	<p>Han Sen went straight to the Nine-Defense Palace. Before the next fight began, he was hoping to achieve butterfly
		class.</p>

	<p>But his gene leveling-up progress was not very smooth. That was because he was already larva class. He ate loads
		of low-class deified xenogeneic genes, but it did not increase his gene tally very much. He needed at least
		larva class deified genes if he wanted to soundly earn more. It was the only way to gain the amount of deified
		genes he needed.</p>

	<p>Of course, it was great to have butterfly class deified genes. He would get more genes from them, but the
		xenogeneics in Nine-Defense Palace were mostly primitive classes. Xenogeneics like Time Ghost, even though it
		was locked up, was not something Han Sen had the chops to kill. So, his progression was going at a snail&#8217;s
		pace for the time being,</p>

	<p>Luckily, Han Sen&#8217;s next opponent was only going to be a transmutation deified. He had a long time to go
		before the next fight, and Han Sen won the fight smoothly.</p>

	<p>In his third match, his opponent was similar and larva class. It was a xenogeneic that looked like a giant
		dragon, but it was not an opponent that truly challenged him. Han Sen wanted to kill it, but the giant dragon
		was evil. The moment it saw things going sour, it threw in the towel and escaped.</p>

	<p>Han Sen won every battle he fought. The name Dollar was something becoming learned across the universe.</p>

	<p>It was a shame Han Sen had to focus all of his time on practicing. He did not have much time to focus on the
		matches conducted by others, so Han Sen had no idea that the most popular name wasn&#8217;t actually Dollar. It
		had become Space Garden&#8217;s Han Sen.</p>

	<p>Space Garden did not have a deified, yet seven from there had joined in the god fights. Although they were all
		primitive class, their performances had been exceptional.</p>

	<p>Aside from one of them having bad luck in which the person who encountered a butterfly class xenogeneic had to
		get kicked out, the other six were able to reach the third round.</p>

	<p>Of course, luck was involved with them all. After all, they were all primitive classes. They did not meet strong
		enemies in their first two bouts, but their performances and powers displayed were still quite shocking.</p>

	<p>Pretty much all of them were the best of what a primitive deified could achieve. They all had very good powers.
	</p>

	<p>Everyone thought this was because of Han Sen. Thus, Space Garden and Han Sen, who did not even use his real name
		to join the fights, had become the hot topic of the universe.</p>

	<p>&#8220;Godfather Han is so awesome. Sword Fairy, Queen, and Dragon Lady Chef are all stronger than the others. I
		would like to go to Space Garden. I wonder if Godfather would be willing to bless me too. Then, I could come out
		and play here.&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;I think the little lady from Demon with purple clothing and the little lady from the Feather are
		stronger.&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;I did not expect Teacher Xie to become deified as well. Also, he is a part of Space Garden. That is so
		rare. But Teacher Xie&#8217;s luck is so bad. He met a Very High true god class, so he had to concede.&#8221;
	</p>

	<p>&#8220;Ha! Ha! Space Garden has seven deifieds. Only Teacher Xie was the one who had the poorest luck. Even that
		weakest Wang Yuhang had extremely good luck. He encountered two primitive deified xenogeneics that were very
		weak, and it got him into the third round.&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;It is a shame Godfather Han has chosen not to participate in the fights. If he did take part, it would
		surely be quite interesting.&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;Does Godfather Han need to join the fight? He can just spit out deifieds. Does he need to join the god
		fights himself? He will earn vast fortunes by just sitting at home.&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;How do we get Godfather Han to start blessing us? If I could ask him, I would be willing to spend
		everything.&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t you even think about it. Every big race has tried capturing Han Sen like crazy. He has created
		many deifieds. Even the three high races are jealous of what he can do.&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t think it will be long before Space Garden becomes the fifth-biggest faction in the entire
		universe. It might even threaten the four races ahead of it. I would suggest pledging our allegiance to them
		quickly. If Space Garden really does become big, we will be the very first few to support it.&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;What you are saying makes sense. If we are lucky and help them out with something, we might be able to get
		Godfather Han to bless us. If that happens, I can become deified too. Then, I can join the god fights and become
		very famous. What should I call myself? Space Garden&#8230; Cow God! What do you guys think of that name?&#8221;
	</p>

	<p>Many ordinary creatures kept talking about this. Many of them wanted to ally with Space Garden, but Space Garden
		was completely cut off. No one was able to go in, so no creature was able to join.</p>

	<p>Upon seeing Han Sen bring so many scary deifieds there, the group of Flower Gods felt very conflicted.</p>

	<p>Many powerful deified elites were sitting there. They could guarantee the safety of Space Garden, and they could
		hunt many of the plant xenogeneics to ensure a steady stream of geno fluids.</p>

	<p>Because there were so many deified elites there, it made the Flower Gods feel a bit worried. They were afraid of
		their genes being too inferior. They thought it might lead to Han Sen and the others abandoning them because
		they were not successful in being able to reach deified.</p>

	<p>They were also hoping that one day, Han Sen could give the Flower Gods some blessings to become deified.</p>

	<p>The races that had the power to capture Han Sen were all trying to find a way to gain access to Space Garden.</p>

	<p>They were interested in the resources available in Space Garden too. Their main interest was Han Sen. If they
		were able to choose between Space Garden and Han Sen, they would select Han Sen without a shadow of a doubt.</p>

	<p>That was especially true of the Very High. They wanted to get Han Sen back. They were afraid of the curse that
		was believed to plague Han Sen. They did not want to risk it coming true. The Very High were also scared of
		Space Garden&#8217;s performance. As Han Sen grew stronger, the more upset they felt.</p>

	<p>Many creatures of the universe were looking for Holy Pirate since he was the only one who could enter Space
		Garden without approval. Even the Pirates themselves were searching for Holy Pirate. It seemed as if Holy Pirate
		had truly disappeared.</p>

	<p>Holy Pirate was feeling very sad. He was being sneaky and feeling scared as he traveled around Extreme King.</p>

	<p>He had promised Han Sen that he would save him from the Extreme King. After a few attempts, there was no chance
		of him succeeding. Therefore, he gave up.</p>

	<p>As soon as the geno god list started and Space Garden had stirred up such a big incident, even Holy Pirate
		himself had become a target of the universe.</p>

	<p>Fortunately, Holy Pirate was very good at running. If he wasn&#8217;t, he would have been caught already.</p>

	<p>Although his name possessed the word &#8220;holy,&#8221; there was nothing holy about the man. He was just a
		runner in the universe. The universe was big, and there was nowhere he couldn&#8217;t really go. Even the Very
		High&#8217;s Outer Sky was a place he could enter easily. He could steal from the Very High too. That was, after
		all, how he had become famous in the universe in the first place.</p>

	<p>Outsiders did not know he stole things. He only played with the things he stole and quickly returned them to the
		Very High just as they were when he took them. If he did not do that, they would not let him get away so easily.
	</p>

	<p>In regard to fighting, Holy Pirate did not think he could go up against the best of the Very High or Extreme
		King. They were all top-class deifieds.</p>

	<p>Holy Pirate was getting chased by the old antiques, and he had to hide. He went to the Extreme King. He was
		planning to take Han Sen back so Han Sen would take him to Space Garden. With Han Sen, he could control Space
		Garden, which was the perfect place for a den for thieves. It was not too bad being a king.</p>

	<p>Holy Pirate&#8217;s power enabled him to ignore many of the security defenses of the Extreme King. He finally
		reached King&#8217;s Garden, where Han Sen was.</p>

	<p>Holy Pirate knew there was a guy called Holy Baby there. It was Bai King&#8217;s student. When he looked into the
		garden, there was no sign of Han Sen. He saw a girl. She was sitting in the garden quietly watching the geno god
		list fight.</p>
