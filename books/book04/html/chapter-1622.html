      “If Skysword is regretting that he agreed to the challenge, we don’t have
      to do this.” God-like was smiling, and he sounded scornful.
    </p>
    <p>“No need. Let’s begin,” said Han Sen calmly.</p>
    <p>
      “No wonder you’re Skysword. You’re definitely confident,” God-like
      complimented Han Sen, then grabbed the Eternal Shield and rushed forward.
    </p>
    <p>
      White light flowed across the shield, and it flew toward Han Sen like a
      comet The light on the shield was getting brighter and brighter, and the
      physical space in front of the shield seemed like it was starting to
      twist.
    </p>
    <p>
      Han Sen looked at God-like and his Eternal Shield, but he remained very
      calm. His physical strength was already at the pinnacle level in the
      Fourth Sanctuary, and he wasn’t weaker than any of the super creatures or
      spirits. Though God-like was powerful, not even a berserk super creature
      was enough to scare Han Sen.
    </p>
    <p>
      He raised his arm and brought out the Overbearing Shield. It became as
      tall as a human being and stood in front of Han Sen. Hong!
    </p>
    <p>
      The Eternal Shield hit the Overbearing Shield, and the powerful shock
      waves shook the space around them, forming a twisted black hole.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Mom, do you think Han Sen can win?” Lotus Empress felt kind of anxious.
      Han Sen had only entered the Fourth Sanctuary a few years earlier than
      her, so she wasn’t sure if he could defend against such a power.
    </p>
    <p>
      Before Night Empress answered, she heard a sound of clashing metal. The
      Eternal Shield hit the Overbearing Shield with terrifying power, but it
      couldn’t damage the Overbearing Shield. It didn’t even force Han Sen to
      take any steps back. Instead, the Eternal Shield and God-like bounced
      back. God-like took four steps back before he could balance himself again,
      and he was shocked.
    </p>
    <p>
      “You deserve your reputation, Skysword!” God-like yelled, and the light on
      the shield got brighter and brighter. He rushed toward the Overbearing
      Shield again.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Eternal Shield kept hitting Han Sen’s shield, and it kept bouncing
      back. It couldn’t make Han Sen move even a little bit.
    </p>
    <p>
      “I can’t believe Han Sen is already this powerful.” Lotus’s eyes were
      gleaming.
    </p>
    <p>
      Night Empress also praised, “I’ve heard about Skysword before, but I can
      hardly believe that this is him. The rumors about him certainly seem to be
      true, though. His power is indeed amazing. I would never have imagined
      that he would already be this powerful after only a decade of being a
      demigod.”
    </p>
    <p>
      Night Empress and the others didn’t know that Han Sen had actually been
      absent from the sanctuary for almost ten years.
    </p>
    <p>
      Han Sen was just standing there, and his arm shield was hit again and
      again. Though the Overbearing Shield wasn’t damaged, it couldn’t damage
      the Eternal Shield of God-like either.
    </p>
    <p>
      “It seems that my shield’s reflecting power isn’t enough to break the
      Eternal Shield.” Han Sen looked at his opponent, but he didn’t feel
      anything. He’d agreed to the competition because he was already
      well-prepared.
    </p>
    <p>
      Seeing that the strikes from God-like didn’t do anything to Han Sen, the
      creatures from Sacred were all dazed.
    </p>
    <p>
      They all knew how sturdy God-like’s shield was. Even though the Eternal
      Shield had hit the Overbearing Shield many times, Han Sen’s shield still
      hadn’t cracked. That meant Han Sen’s shield had to be just as sturdy as
      the Eternal Shield.
    </p>
    <p>“Are you done?” Han Sen asked, looking at God-like.</p>
    <p>
      “I’ve never stopped you from making attacks. You can do so whenever you
      want.” God-like was surprised by how solid Han Sen’s shield was, but he
      wasn’t that worried.
    </p>
    <p>
      He couldn’t break Han Sen’s defense, but he was still confident in his own
      Eternal Shield. He was confident that Han Se couldn’t damage his shield,
      and it would end up in a tie.
    </p>
    <p>Han Sen smiled, and he summoned an object into his hand.</p>
    <p>
      God-like was suddenly anxious. After all, the reputation of Skysword
      preceded him. Though he had the invincible Eternal Shield, he still
      couldn’t help being nervous.
    </p>
    <p>
      He looked at Han Sen’s hands, and he saw that Han Sen was grabbing an
      object about the size of an egg instead of something sharp.
    </p>
    <p>
      Even so, God-like didn’t dare underestimate it. He summoned all the power
      in his body and infused it into the Eternal Shield, and the shield started
      to shine like a sacred object.
    </p>
    <p>
      Han Sen was holding his Crystal Core. He took a look at the radiant
      Eternal Shield. He grabbed the Crystal Core, and he pulled his arm back.
      And then, he threw the Crystal Core out like a baseball.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Crystal Core flew between them like lightning, and then it hit the
      Eternal Shield.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Hou!” At the same time, God-like yelled as well, and all his power burst
      out, condensing in the Eternal Shield and making it much more solid.
    </p>
    <p>
      Everyone stared at the place where the Eternal Shield and the Crystal Core
      would connect. However, what happened next shocked everyone and made their
      eyes pop out. They couldn’t believe what they were seeing.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Crystal Core hit the Eternal Shield hard, like a china cup hitting an
      iron plate, and the Crystal Core was smashed into pieces.
    </p>
    <p>
      Everyone was startled. They originally thought that the object Han Sen
      threw out would be a powerful one, but nobody had expected it to be
      immediately smashed, so all of them found it quite unacceptable.
    </p>
    <p>
      However, after the Crystal Core got smashed, that wasn’t the end of it. A
      small skeleton climbed out and hit the Eternal Shield with one punch.
    </p>
    <p>
      God-like was scared again because he didn’t know what the skeleton was. He
      condensed his power again and used his Eternal Shield to ward off that
      punch.
    </p>
    <p>
      What confused God-like was that the punch from the jade skeleton didn’t
      have much power. When its small fist hit the Eternal Shield, it barely
      made any sound, and God-like didn’t even feel his shield tremble. The jade
      skeleton then flew back into Han Sen’s hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      “I thought that was going to be impressive, but you were just bluffing,”
      said the giant dragon.
    </p>
    <p>
      Everyone else thought the same thing that the giant dragon did. They all
      thought that Han Sen was just bluffing, since the attack didn’t do
      anything.
    </p>
    <p>
      “No wonder. After all, this is the Eternal Shield of our leader. Even if
      Skysword’s shield is impressive, it won’t be able to damage the Eternal
      Shield,” said another creature, smiling.
    </p>
    <p>
      However, God-like’s expression suddenly changed, and he made a small
      squeaking sound. Everyone looked to him and his Eternal Shield.
    </p>
    <p>
      A jade color was spreading across the surface of the Eternal Shield, and
      after only a short while, it covered the entire Eternal Shield and turned
      it into a jade sculpture. It looked completely different from the original
      Eternal Shield now.
    </p>
    <p>
      All the mutant creatures from Sacred were stunned because they didn’t know
      whether the change was good or bad. All the creatures from Night Shelter
      looked at the Eternal Shield curiously, as they didn’t know what was going
      on.
    </p>
    <p>
      As for God-like, his face was already deep red, and his eyes were filled
      with horror.
