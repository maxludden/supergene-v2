  Roar!

One of the Viscounts amidst the nine captains roared. His armor cracked, and his muscles inflated. His skin looked like steel, and his eyes became red. He was turning xenogeneic.

Han Sen was not surprised by this, though. In fact, he was quite happy about it Han Sen used his Dongxuan Movements to avoid fighting all nine of them at the same time. But that did not mean he couldn’t kill them. It just enabled him to scope out the right time to strike.

In the xenogeneic universe, killing xenogeneics was widely approved. It was the only way he could nab beast souls, too.

The Greatsword Viscount was just a Noble when he was killed. Because of this, the sanctuaries did not get involved and he wasn’t able to receive any decent loot

The xenogeneic Greataxe Viscount went mad. He shouted, right as his steel-like body took off running towards Han Sen. His hands clutched a greataxe.

Han Sen’s body moved like some sort of weird bird. When he dodged the greataxe, his own sword struck the xenogeneic Viscount’s neck.

The Pirate Bone Sword was very sharp, and not even a Viscount’s body could withstand its edge. If the Pirate Bone Sword found its target on the enemy, the xenogeneic Viscount would be beheaded.

But the xenogeneic Greataxe Viscount was blisteringly fast. When the greataxe was only halfway through its swing, its operator was able to pull it back swiftly. Then, it came at Han Sen again, but at a speed that was even faster than his own sword.

In the air, Han Sen’s body had no protection. He was exposed. He borrowed the strength of the air, though, and moved three feet to the side to dodge the raging ax.

The other Viscounts pulled out their spears and threw them. They came at Han Sen from every single angle. And even though Han Sen was moving like a bird, it was difficult to dodge. He was not a real bird, after all.

The Dongxuan Armor’s energy kept on surging. He wasn’t a bird, but his body seemed light as a feather. He was like a phoenix soaring through the sky. He evaded the spears as the Pirate Bone Sword was swung towards the xenogeneic’s neck again.

The xenogeneic Viscount used his greataxe to block. It had been forged from xenogeneic Viscount materials, too. But even so, it was broken in a single hit.

Luckily for the Taurus, the xenogeneic Viscount was very fast. He roared and fell back a few meters to avoid the deadly strike.

A few other Viscounts approached, with all the other weapons being cogs in a machine that was coming for Han Sen.

Han Sen moved with incredible precision. Despite being locked in an impossibly small space, he was able to break through the effort to surround him. He was still coming for the xenogeneic Viscount.

Everyone could see that this was what he wished to do, however. Amidst the effort of surrounding him, he wanted to kill the xenogeneic Taurus Viscount above all.

“He is so brave! He is so strong! He is so awesome!” Mister Ji complimented Han Sen three times.

Even Lao Zhuoma and Mike knew what Han Sen wanted to do, and it was a strangely obvious move to make.

“Am I crazy or is he crazy? Does he really want to push and kill the xenogeneic Viscount while he is still surrounded? Is this guy really a Baron?” Mike was very surprised.

“If he isn’t a Baron, it makes sense why the Taurus are being killed so simply.” A Baron gave a wry smile.

Before Han Sen got off the ship, no one could suspect things might turn out this way. No one believed a Baron could truly go up against an army as accomplished as this one.

And this was something not even a Baron from the higher classes could achieve.

In fact, amidst the highest lanterns in the geno hall, there were Barons. But none of those would be as dexterous as Han Sen.

Han Sen wouldn’t say he was the strongest, but if he fought solo, he was the absolute best.

The combination of the Dongxuan Aura’s buff, the Dongxuan Movements, and his Phoenix Techniques was something none of Han Sen’s opponents would be able to overcome. Assuming no one extra strong appeared, Han Sen would be undefeated for sure.

The scary thing was, he had infinite power. He wouldn’t be fatigued.

“Stop him!” Angry Steel shouted. He had never experienced such a dire state of affairs before. A Baron was challenging the whole of his army, and the Baron was going to kill another of his best captains. If the attempt was successful, it would be mortifying.

Aside from the xenogeneic Viscount, the eight other captains knew that if Han Sen captured the xenogeneic’s corpse, the Angry Steel Army might still be considered a joke even if they killed him. They all tried to stop Han Sen.

But as they moved to attack, they saw that the situation had changed. They were no longer surrounding Han Sen. It was more like Han Sen was chasing their leader.

After all the fighting that had transpired, they could not stop the swordlights. They knew it was only a matter of time before Han Sen put an end to the xenogeneic Viscount, but when Han Sen moved, he was never where they expected him to be. Their swords could not hit Han Sen, and many of the swords were broken by Han Sen’s Pirate Bone Sword.

They watched as Han Sen quickly approached the xenogeneic Viscount, but no one could stop him.

Roar! The xenogeneic Viscount shouted. The muscles across his body were huge. In one hand he held a broken handle, and in the other he held the broken head of the ax. He was now running towards Han Sen.

There were two Viscounts on the right and left, and there were two Viscounts behind Han Sen.

But Han Sen looked so calm, and all he did was move quickly. He jumped up, and with a swordlight, he spied an opportunity. He came out from the ring surrounding him, twisted his body, and slipped past the xenogeneic Viscount. Then, he drew his sword.

It was so fast it was like lightning. A swordmind appeared that was difficult to understand. It was right in front of the xenogeneic Viscount.

It was too late, though. The xenogeneic Viscount shouted and threw his weapons away, as his blood vessels almost burst He used both hands in an attempt to stop the Pirate Bone Sword that was quickly approaching.

Han Sen was not as strong as the xenogeneic Viscount, and when his sword was grabbed, he couldn’t push it onwards. Angry Steel and the Taurus warriors were all filled with happiness for a change.

But the next second, their mood and color changed. The straight blade of the sword that the xenogeneic Viscount had grabbed suddenly curved like a crescent moon. It created a weird angle, piercing into the Viscount’s head.
