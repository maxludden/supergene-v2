When Han Sen saw Luo Haitang, he was shocked.

The Luo Haitang he saw now was completely different. The man was so slim that he was practically skin and bones. His eyes were sunk deep in their sockets, and his hair was white. He looked like a dying old man, and not the fabled Godslayer Luo that Han Sen had known.

It was hard to imagine Luo Haitang’s body had become like this over the course of a few years.

“Don’t cry for me. I just wanted to see your smile and anger.” Luo Haitang touched Luo Lan’s hair.

“I’m too stubborn. I’m sorry.” Luo Lan refused to raise her head. She did not want him to see her cry.

“If you weren’t stubborn, you wouldn’t be my granddaughter.” Luo Haitang looked so happy, brushing Luo Lan’s hair.

Luo Lan smiled and cried. She touched Han Yufei and Han Sen, and introduced Luo Haitang.

“It is nice to see you here.” Luo Haitang accepted their bows and returned to smiling at Luo Lan.

“If you are willing to, you can stay with us. This is not the Luo family, but ours can be your home,” Luo Lan said as she held Luo Haitang.

Luo Haitang smiled. “You guys can have dinner with me. It’s been a while, and I asked people to make your favorite leaf with rice.”

“Sure.” Luo Lan wanted to cry, unable to believe he could remember small things like that.

The meal was fairly normal, like an ordinary family dinner. There wasn’t much talk, just average conversations like ordinary families have.

At the end of the dinner, Luo Haitang asked Luo Li to take them to their rooms. Before they left, though, Luo Haitang said to Han Sen, “There is no more of the Luo family. You can do whatever you wish with the Falsified-Sky Sutra. If you really want, you can give it to Jade Shura.”

Han Sen looked back at Luo Haitang in shock. The skinny face was wearing a smile, but it had turned red, and the eyes in it were bright.

When Han Sen saw this, his heart felt bad. Luo Haitang’s lifeforce was so strong in that moment, and it was obvious he was going to die. He didn’t think they’d ever meet again after that.

Han Sen stopped and looked at Luo Haitang’s lifeforce. He didn’t really care about matters concerning the Luo family, but Luo Lan and Luo Haitang had a connection. And Han Sen did not want to see his mother upset.

Luo Haitang’s body was messy. It was a human body, but he had shura qi.

When a human practiced the powers of the shura, it was something of a miracle for them to last this long.

Luo Haitang wasn’t like Zero. She had shura blood and could use Shura Change. Luo Haitang’s body would be damaged if he used Shura Change. It was something few could imagine.

Han Sen knew that every time the man used it, the pain would be excruciating.

Luo Lan told them to leave, but Han Sen turned back. He stood in front of Luo Haitang and placed his hand on the old man’s chest.

“What are you doing?” Luo Li was shocked. She started to run over to him, but Han Yufei stopped her.

Han Yufei said coldly, “If Han Sen wanted to kill him, there’d be nothing you could do to stop him.”

Luo Li stopped struggling. It wasn’t a nice thing to be told, but it was pretty much the truth. Without Godslayer Luo, the family was likely to fall, too.

Luo Li knew Luo Haitang was dying. And at this point, Han Sen was much stronger than Luo Haitang had been in his prime.

“It’s fine.” Luo Haitang nodded to Luo Li, and then said to Han Sen, “Little Han, you don’t need to bother with this. I know what is happening.”

Han Sen didn’t say anything, but he used his Dongxuan Aura to cover Luo Haitang. Then, he used Yin Yang Blast to punch it in.

Luo Haitang’s problem was the fact that his shura qi could not combine with his body. The longer he practiced, the stronger the shura qi became, and the more the old man was injured.

This was more than bodily decay. His very lifeforce was being injured. It was like he said; his body had been irreversibly damaged.

Han Sen knew a few healing skills, but they weren’t very strong. Even the silver fox could not hope to heal Luo Haitang now.

Han Sen did not need to heal his body, though. Han Sen just had to get rid of the shura qi inside him. Without the shura qi around, he’d be easier to heal. And this wouldn’t happen again.

Luo Haitang had practiced shura qi for many years. It had combined with his flesh and integrated into every cell. It did not matter how strong you were, it would be difficult to remove shura qi without harming the body.

But to Han Sen, this wasn’t an impossible task. That was because his Dongxuan Aura could observe the sequential structure of Luo Haitang’s body. He could break the chain of the shura qi.

Han Sen just had to find the correct sequence chains and break them. Then, he could remove the shura qi without hurting Luo Haitang.

But that also meant all those years of practice would be gone, and Luo Haitang would not be as strong as he once was.

Han Sen put a small amount of the Dongxuan power into Luo Haitang’s body. Then he broke the shura qi, one by one.

Every time he broke a shura qi, Luo Haitang felt better. Luo Lan and Luo Li were delighted.

Han Sen could only break a little each time, otherwise he’d harm Luo Haitang’s body. Because of this, progress was slow, and it took him a number of hours to reach the halfway point

Han Sen admired the fact that Luo Haitang had practiced the shura qi, though. He had obviously put in a lot of effort. It was shocking that he had managed to endure all that pain in its practice.

Luo Lan and Han Yufei were waiting patiently, while Ji Yanran brought Bao’er and Littleflower to rest.

Bao’er was not tired, though. She watched Han Sen with wide eyes. But Littleflower was young, and so Ji Yanran put him to bed. After Ji Yanran laid him down, she returned to watch Han Sen and Luo Haitang.

While Littleflower was sleeping, he felt an itch on his face. It was so itchy, it made him sneeze. And when he did, he opened his eyes. There, he saw a red beast that looked like both a cat and a fox. It was smiling at him.
