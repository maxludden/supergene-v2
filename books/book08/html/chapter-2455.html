<h2>The Woman in the Wooden House</h2>
<h3>Chapter 2455</h3>

<p>Han Sen was hesitant. He didn’t know if he should stay in the
demon spirit’s eyes or jump to the eyes of this woman.</p>
<p>From what the woman had said, he could guess that she had been
imprisoned in this house by the demon spirit. If Han Sen leaped
into her eyes, even if she never discovered his presence, there was
a chance he might never leave that place.</p>
<p>But if he stayed inside the eyes of the demon spirit, who knew
how long he would have to remain inside the Sea Demon Car.
Twiddling his thumbs in the Sea Demon Car for a few hundred years
would be a pretty miserable fate.</p>
<p>“The woman should be easier to deal with than the demon spirit.
Even if I’m discovered, it won’t be as difficult to escape.” Han
Sen could feel that the demon spirit was on the precipice of
leaving. Putting away his hesitation, Han Sen reflected himself
into the eyes of the woman before the demon spirit had a chance to
break eye contact.</p>
<p>With the woman’s curses still echoing around him, the demon
spirit walked back down the hill away from the house. As he watched
the demon spirit’s receding back, Han Sen felt rather glum.</p>
<p>“Finally, back to normal.” With the woman’s vision, Han Sen
could finally see colors again. It was a relief to have normal
vision after being stuck in the monochromatic eyes of the demon
spirit.</p>
<p>When the woman saw that the demon spirit had finally left, she
stopped swearing. Then, she turned away from the window.</p>
<p>The woman glanced around, and as she did, Han Sen followed her
gaze. The interior of the house was packed with bookshelves, and
the bookshelves were all lined with books.</p>
<p>The woman’s eyes moved too quickly, however, which kept Han Sen
from being able to read the titles on the books.</p>
<p>The woman walked downstairs and left the house. Despite her
earlier anger, the woman walked over to the book that the demon
spirit had left on the grass and picked it up.</p>
<p>When she returned to the house, the woman threw the Shocking
World Record of the Extreme King on the floor. She stomped on it
many times, discharging some of her leftover anger.</p>
<p>A while later, the woman picked up the Shocking World Record of
the Extreme King. She used a cloth to clean it, then placed it on a
bookshelf.</p>
<p>The woman grew restless after that. She stood up and moved back
to that same bookshelf, repositioning the Shocking World Record
slightly.</p>
<p>“Does this woman have OCD?” Han Sen thought that the woman was a
bit weird. There were no other creatures on this mountain, only
this one woman living alone in a wooden house. Han Sen wanted to
escape her eyes, but it appeared as if doing so would be
impossible.</p>
<p>“I don’t know what this woman is capable of. If her power is
average, I can just wait until I’m sure that the demon spirit is
gone. Then I can race out of her eyes to make an escape.” In
preparation for that eventuality, Han Sen paid careful attention to
the woman.</p>
<p>The woman was definitely strange. When she was done fiddling
with the book, she went to sit at the window and peer outside. Han
Sen realized that the clouds outside the island weren’t white
anymore. They were light yellow like butter.</p>
<p>Han Sen was happy. He brought out his Wanjie Rubix Cube and
filmed what could be seen from the window. He then sent it to the
Treasure Identifier Elder.</p>
<p>“Didn’t you want to capture me and claim the bounty on my head?
Come and try it,” Han Sen said to the Rubix cube after he made the
film.</p>
<p>After the Treasure Identifier Elder received the footage from
Han Sen, he edited the clip and began streaming it.</p>
<p>Han Sen didn’t know what effect this play might have, but for
now, it was all he could do.</p>
<p>Thankfully, the wooden house didn’t have any mirrors or swords.
Otherwise, if she looked into a mirror and noticed that her left
eye was red, she’d realize there was a problem.</p>
<p>The woman sat in front of the window for a long time. Han Sen
didn’t know what she was thinking about, and he was starting to
believe that she’d never move again. But after a while, the woman
finally moved.</p>
<p>The woman sighed deeply. She stood up and moved toward a
desk.</p>
<p>The desk was laden with stacks of books and documents. There
were no tools that required electricity, but perhaps that was due
to the magnetic storms that plagued the Tianxia System. Electric
instruments probably wouldn’t work here anyway.</p>
<p>The woman’s room was organized with the same fastidious
attention to detail as the rest of the house. The items on the
table were arranged tidily, and her books and notebooks were all
lined up perfectly. All the pens were in the pen cup.</p>
<p>The woman had serious OCD issues. When she sat down in front of
the desk, she picked up the top notebook. She opened the notebook
and flipped to an empty page.</p>
<p>After a moment of thought, the woman wrote something down on the
empty book. She assembled words, numbers, and symbols into a
variety of formulas that Han Sen was unable to comprehend.</p>
<p>Han Sen didn’t know what the woman was doing. The woman wrote
with repeated breaks for thought. Before long, she picked up a book
from the bookshelf. She flipped through it quickly, apparently
trying to find something specific.</p>
<p>“Phenomenon? Isn’t that the geno art that is similar to Sky
Palace’s Textless Book?” Han Sen thought in surprise. Phenomenon
was a secret skill of Sky Palace, as well.</p>
<p>What happened next surprised Han Sen even more. The woman kept
pulling down and perusing different books, and those books were of
the top geno arts exclusive to a variety of different races. Many
of them were guarded with the utmost secrecy.</p>
<p>Han Sen saw the Destroyed’s geno art Three-Bodies-in-One
Destroyed Chaos Godlight and the Dragon’s Evilbreaker Dragon
Presence. Many other famous geno arts that were known across the
geno universe were there, as well. There were also many names that
Han Sen had never even heard before.</p>
<p>“Who is this woman? And why does she have so many secret geno
arts here? Surely the spirit demon didn’t steal them all just for
her, right? That should be impossible! Those races wouldn’t hand
out their secrets for free. How many elites would really bring
their secret geno arts to Tianxia System just to get mugged?” Han
Sen couldn’t make sense of the situation.</p>
<p>But as he watched, Han Sen soon realized what she was doing. She
was obviously researching the geno arts. Because he didn’t know
what she was writing, though, he couldn’t understand the research
she was doing.</p>
<p>It was like when normal people made use of computer software.
Although people might use a program every single day, if they saw a
coder working on that same program, they wouldn’t have a clue what
they were seeing.</p>
<p>Unless Han Sen could see the geno arts she was researching, he
wouldn’t have a single clue to figure out what he was seeing. The
symbols and formulas weren’t enough for him to tell what she was
working on.</p>
<p>“No, this won’t work… If I keep it complete, no creature will be
able to reach the required fitness level. Lowering the fitness
requirements will dismantle the skill, so that would be useless…
How do I keep it complete and also lower the fitness requirements
for practice?” The woman mumbled to herself. She was putting an
almost painful level of focus into the problem, but she couldn’t
seem to come up with any solutions.</p>
<p>She grappled with the problem for a while longer, but she still
couldn’t figure it out. She walked over to the bookshelf, pulled
down the Shocking World Record, and began reading through it.</p>
