  The Sky’s shadow was becoming bigger in Han Sen’s eyes. A scary presence that could not be described with words was landing on Han Sen.

The presence was scary but not enough to prompt a shift in Han Sen’s will and determination.

Still, the presence of the Sky still shocked Han Sen. Although it was just a fake character that was little more than a calculation, it was still incredibly powerful. One likely could not tell if the Sky was a genuine life force or not. One could not tell it was just a shadow.

Han Sen did not think much. He saw another powerful shadow emerge from the god light. It was a weird man with three heads and six arms. It was a weird person, and it was one of the Destroyed.

This fellow from the Destroyed was stronger than any Destroyed elite Han Sen had seen before. It was like a demon god that was standing between the sky and the ground. Its presence was very scary. It was like the sea or even like hell. It exuded a presence that suffocated Han Sen.

One after another, elites came out of the evolution wall releasing a strong presence on their way to Han Sen.

No matter how strong Han Sen’s will was, when there were more and more elites showing up, he started to feel pressure.

If they were real elites, no matter how many there were, they could not do anything to Han Sen.

These were coming from the evolution wall. It was scary to see the people from those races evolved to the max of their potential. Although they had no real bodies and did not actually exist, the presence they released was nothing fake. It was like they were coming out of real bodies.

Many powerful bodies showed up. Han Sen felt a whole heap of pressure, and that was just the shadow of a hundred races. “Crape Myrtle wants to use their presence to suppress my will so it can become stronger.” Han Sen understood Crape Myrtle’s rationale for setting up all this, but he doubted it might actually work.

More and more shadows showed up. Their power was far too grand to imagine. If this was someone else in his shoes, their will would have snapped by now. Even Han Sen could felt his own body was rather tense. In the battlegrounds of the 33 skies, Ancient Devil was like a demon shadow. He got close to Human King.

Human King did not move. His body did not move. When the space and the will around changed, the distances separating the two appeared longer.

Ancient Devil’s body, which looked like a shadow, was elongated. It reached before Human King.

“What a shame,” Human King quietly muttered. No one knew what he meant. He reached out a hand and slapped Ancient Devil as if he was swatting a fly.

The hand looked as if it covered the sky and covered the ground. Ancient Devil was unable to escape its area. Before the hand could touch Ancient Devil’s body, the pressure alone was enough to explode his body and have it become black dust that scattered everywhere.

It happened in one hit. Ancient Devil’s body exploded, and the fight came to an end. Ancient Devil’s name on the geno tablet was wiped away, leaving only Human King’s name there.

“Did it just end?”

“Human King is too strong.”

“This is the real sort of invincible elite. Compared to Han Sen, this is so much worse.”

“They are all top four. The differences between them are still too much.”

In the universe of kingdoms, people were shocked. They thought Human King was extremely strong. They were surprised about his appearance. Human King had only used one hand to kill Ancient Devil. Afterward, he frowned and secretly said to himself, “That Ancient Devil looked as if he had a death wish. What was he doing?”

Boom! Boom! Boom!

After Ancient Devil died, the final barrier of the 33 skies came down. Now, all of the 33 skies could be seen. The geno tablet that was no longer there was now seen in the arena. It was glowing with a god light. On the geno tablet, two names were shining like a pair of suns. No one would have believed that those two would have been the final names to be displayed on the geno tablet.

There was Human King and Crape Myrtle. They were the last two names. They were deep in every creature’s brain. They were names that were now hard to forget.

Human King looked at Crape Myrtle. He also looked surprised. Clearly, he never thought the last opponent would end up being a God Spirit. Crape Myrtle knew about Human King. He was not surprised to see him.

Human King looked at Crape Myrtle. After a while, he said, “I did not expect to see you here.” Clearly, he recognized who Crape Myrtle was.

Crape Myrtle looked at Human King and said, “It looks like you did not only absorb Qin Xiu, but you also have Qin Xiu’s memories.”

Human King said, “I have been planning this for years. If I could not take everything, it would have been a colossal waste of all my time and energy. And you, you are the Geno Hall Leader, yet you joined the geno tablet fights. That must damage your reputation quite a bit.”

The universe was shocked. None believed Crape Myrtle was the Geno Hall Leader.

“No way! God Hall Leader joined the geno tablet fights?”

“People like Human King would not talk nonsense.” “Is that true? Is Crape Myrtle the leader of the geno hall?”

Crape Myrtle did not move. He looked at Human King and said, “It looks like you have access to everything about Qin Xiu, but you did not earn his confidence.”

Human King did not move. He coldly said, “I will fight when I must. When I do not need to fight, why should I waste my breath?”

Human King brought attention to Crape Myrtle’s identity because he did not want to fight Crape Myrtle. Before he really walked the last step, Human King was still going to be rather afraid of Crape Myrtle.

As the master of the geno hall, Crape Myrtle did not have what it took to be the leader of the geno tablet.

Crape Myrtle looked at Human King and said, “I only just came here. I cannot simply leave like this. Han Sen took my 28 starlights, so I suspect you will do the same.”

Human King coldly laughed. “You know you cannot do that, so why would you even bother to try?”

“I like it.” Crape Myrtle curled his lips. His fingers came forward like starlight.

Human King was powerful, but he was unable to dodge Crape Myrtle’s finger-borne starlight. Just like Han Sen, his body was pinned in place by the starlight nails.

Human King was not in a rush to escape such bindings. He did not even look as if he wanted to struggle. He looked at Crape Myrtle and said, “If you like it, you can give me more starlight.”

Crape Myrtle smiled. He turned around and left. He quit the arena of the 33 skies.

No one knew the geno tablet fights were to end in such a way. When Crape Myrtle departed the battleground, his name was erased from the geno tablet. All that was left behind was Human King’s name.

The light of the geno tablet was very bright. Human King’s name was shining brightly. The 33 skies were suddenly so noisy as if it was welcoming a new master.

The starlight on Human King’s body shattered. He did not go to the geno tablet. He looked at his body and said to himself, “You might be able to stop me now but not forever. This kind of power will only delay my ascension to walking that step by a few days. It will not stop anything. Your empire will fall.”
