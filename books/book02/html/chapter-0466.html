    <p>
      &#8220;Li!&#8221; Seeing the warframe of Li Lu was shot down, the two
      soldiers shot at the red crystal warframes madly using laser guns.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Come inside. Quickly,&#8221; Ji Yanran exclaimed at the two
      soldiers, but it was too late.
    </p>

    <p>
      Although the two soldiers shot down a few red crystal warframes, they were
      taken out by more simulating crystals.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Go!&#8221; Han Sen exclaimed and used his warframe arm to push Ji
      Yanran&#8217;s.
    </p>

    <p>
      Although those people were not his friends yet, Han Sen felt upset seeing
      fellow humans die. However, now was not the time to be sad. He could not
      watch Ji Yanran die like those soldiers.
    </p>

    <p>
      Ji Yanran came back to herself, gritted her teeth, and operated the
      warframe to go inside the ruin. They had to get rid of the simulating
      crystals as soon as possible. Otherwise, she and Han Sen would die as
      well.
    </p>

    <p>
      Behind the black crystal gate, there was a crystal path. Ji Yanran led Han
      Sen to go forward but did not dare to go too fast. Very soon, the red
      crystal warframes started to catch up with them.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Don&#8217;t worry so much. Run quickly.&#8221; Han Sen knew that Ji
      Yanran was worried about the traps in the ruin, but if they did not go
      quickly, they would soon lose their lives.
    </p>

    <p>
      The expert panel should have already entered the ruin. If there were any
      traps, they should have triggered those already. Being yelled at Han Sen,
      Ji Yanran suddenly understood that and operated her warframe at full speed
      to go forward. After they ran for several miles, the entered a huge
      architecture like a shelter. Many paths were interconnected.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Where are we going?&#8221; Ji Yanran took a look, but path looked
      identical to each other. She had no idea where they were supposed to go.
    </p>

    <p>
      In addition, the paths were so narrow that the warframes could not pass.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Follow me.&#8221; Han Sen gritted his teeth, came out of the
      warframe, and turned it into a briefcase. He ran ahead with the warframe
      in his hand.
    </p>

    <p>Ji Yanran copied Han Sen&#8217;s moves and followed him.</p>

    <p>
      As Han Sen just entered the path, he quickly summoned the snow-toothed
      wolf. A snow wolf suddenly appeared in front of Han Sen. It was a beast
      soul mount, but Han Sen did not mean to ride on it, only commanding it to
      go forward.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen planned to use the snow-toothed wolf as a scout. He knew very
      little about Crystallizer ruins. However, since Ji Yanran did not have any
      idea, he must make a decision, even if he did not know whether his
      decision was right or not. Hesitation would only bring them into bigger
      crisis.
    </p>

    <p>
      The snow-toothed wolf was running forward, and Han Sen and Ji Yanran were
      following with warframe cases in their hands. However, the paths were so
      complicated that they lost the direction although there were no dangers.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;It sounds quiet now. Let&#8217;s stop.&#8221; When reaching
      something like a bridge, Han Sen looked down and stopped, looking at the
      weird crystal statues.
    </p>

    <p>
      Ji Yanran listened carefully and indeed heard no sound. She felt relieved
      and looked to the crystal statues about 50 feet tall each.
    </p>

    <p>
      The statues were made of crystals of different colors. The shapes of them
      looked rather odd. They were nothing like humans or animals.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Those are the deities that Crystallizers worshiped. Most
      Crystallizer ruins had statues like these,&#8221; explained Ji Yanran as
      she looked around.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen did not seem to be listening but fixed his eyes on one statue.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Come out, otherwise I would not be polite.&#8221; Han Sen squeezed
      the warframe case in his hand and yelled coldly at the statue.
    </p>

    <p>
      Ji Yanran looked to the statute, feeling puzzled. She did not see
      anything, but very soon, someone walked from behind the statue.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Tang Xin? How are you here? Where is everyone else?&#8221; Ji
      Yanran saw who it was and asked with her brows knitted.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;I don&#8217;t know. We scattered. Why are you here as well?&#8221;
      Tang Xin walked to the two of them as he said.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Stop. Otherwise I will shoot.&#8221; Han Sen quickly drew his mini
      laser gun from his waist, pointed it at Tang Xin and said coldly.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Why should I stop?&#8221; Tang Xin did not pay Han Sen any mind and
      continued to approach them.
    </p>

    <p>Boom!</p>

    <p>
      Without any hesitation, Han Sen shot at Tang Xin&#8217;s head, taking half
      of his skull away.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Han Sen, what did you do?&#8221; Ji Yanran was startled, not sure
      why Han Sen did it.
    </p>

    <p>
      However, Ji Yanran knew Han Sen must have a reason. Although Tang Xin had
      offended Han Sen before, Ji Yanran knew he was not someone who would
      commit murder because of a small grudge.
    </p>

    <p>
      Without Han Sen explaining, she saw what was wrong. With half of his goal
      grown, Tang Xin did not fall immediately but turned around.
    </p>

    <p>
      On Tang Xin&#8217;s back, a pink crystal the size of a duck egg was set in
      his muscles. Red crystal hair was growing from the crystal, driven into
      his entire back like veins, blinking red light as if he got new heart. It
      looked both weird and sickening.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Parasite crystal!&#8221; Ji Yanran was astonished, quickly drew her
      gun and aimed at the crystal like Han Sen, ready to shot.
    </p>

    <p>
      Before Ji Yanran shot Tang Xin, a slim hair grew from the crystal and
      wrapped Tang Xin up entirely like a mummy.
    </p>

    <p>Boom boom boom!</p>

    <p>
      Ji Yanran and Han Sen shot at the mummy like Tang Xin repeatedly, but to
      no avail. The laser guns only broke a part of the crystal hair, which
      quickly grew again.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Laser weapons are useless. Use beast souls.&#8221; They suddenly
      heard a voice say. Han Sen and Ji Yanran turned back and saw Professor Li
      Mingtang and several young researchers coming from a path nearby. It was
      Li Mingtang who said that.
    </p>

    <p>
      Before Han Sen summoned his beast souls, someone came from behind Li
      Mingtang. He held a beast soul sword and slashed at Tang Xin and the
      crystal repeatedly, breaking the crystal.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;A cookhouse soldier does not belong here.&#8221; Wang Hou took back
      his beast soul sword, stared at Han Sen coldly and said.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;A cookhouse soldier is also soldier,&#8221; Han Sen said calmly.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;If you want to throw your life away, suit yourself,&#8221; Wang Hou
      said contemptuously and ignored Han Sen. He walked to Ji Yanran and said,
      &#8220;Captain, why are you down here? You should not be here.&#8221;
