	<p>When Han Sen went back to the Qin Kingdom and Feng family castle, it was only four days later.</p>

	<p>He heard that the Chu Kingdom’s border had a scary ice god pulse manifest, and so the concept tempted him quite a
		bit.</p>

	<p>His Dongxuan Sutra and Blood-Pulse Sutra were already able to break the world. The Story of Genes could manifest
		Spell. He did not need more power, but his Jadeskin was lacking. It required a rare gene race to reverse the
		power of his body. The Chu Kingdom had a super ice god pulse show up. Perhaps there was a chance of a rare ice
		gene race showing up.</p>

	<p>Jadeskin was not completely an ice element, but one ice gene race for its body was likely enough. So, Han Sen
		wanted to go to the ice fields.</p>

	<p>Han Sen thought, “After Qin Xiu took control of the God Chaos Party, the God Chaos Party has not tried to do
		anything attention-drawing. I am afraid things will end up as God Hall Leader said. He has not gained complete
		control of the black crystal armor, and that is why he is worried. In these times, nothing explicitly bad should
		happen.”</p>

	<p>“Mister Han, the king wants you to go and visit him.” Before Han Sen could move, Qin Jing Zhen’s officer arrived
		at the Feng family castle to deliver a decree issued by the king.</p>

	<p>Han Sen thought about it and decided on following the officer to go and see the king.</p>

	<p>When Wan’er was revived, Qin Jing Zhen ended up getting attacked by her. The wounds he had received were quite
		bad. Han Sen had not seen the king since that happened, so he was keen on learning about what happened to the
		man.</p>

	<p>When Han Sen next saw Qin Jing Zhen, he frowned.</p>

	<p>Qin Jing Zhen was a powerful elite. When he saw him, he was totally fine. Upon seeing him now, he looked pale.
		His eyes looked tired. It seemed as if he was still sick.</p>

	<p>Han Sen had a closer look. He sighed and said, “I did not expect Qin Jing Zhen’s wounds to be even worse than I
		thought. I am afraid he will not live long.”</p>

	<p>Qin Jing Zhen smiled. He pointed at the chair and said to Han Sen, “Please sit, Mister Han.”</p>

	<p>“My King, why have you sought me out?” Han Sen asked. With the condition Qin Jing Zhen’s body was in, he was not
		going to be asked there for a casual, mid-day chat.</p>

	<p>Qin Jing Zhen sighed and said, “Mister, you are a miracle man. I am sure you can tell that I am going to die
		soon.”</p>

	<p>“If you trust me, I can check your body over and maybe help you out,” Han Sen said. “While I may not be able to
		save your life forever, I can possibly make your life last a bit longer.”</p>

	<p>In front of the Qin Kingdom’s king, other people would have watched their words and spoke with great care. Han
		Sen, however, was not that worried. “Please, Master,” Qin Jing Zhen said without any doubt. On any other day,
		Qin Jing Zhen would not have let any random person touch his body. This time was different.</p>

	<p>The Qin Kingdom had many elites, but no one had been able to do anything to alleviate his wounds. Even Jian Bu Gu
		said he could only live for another year at the most. Qin Jing Zhen was not too worried about his safety
		anymore.</p>

	<p>Plus, Han Sen had saved Bai Qin inside the alpha temple and drew Wan’er away. It made Qin Jing Zhen trust him a
		bit more. That was why he was not so worried about letting him help now.</p>

	<p>Han Sen reached out his finger and placed it on Qin Jing Zhen’s forehead. He was forced to use his Dongxuan
		Sutra’s power and inject it into the ailing man’s body.</p>

	<p>The structure of Qin Jing Zhen’s body went into Han Sen’s brain. All of his cells were dyed with gold light.</p>

	<p>The gold light was very bright. Although it was very weak, it was hard to ignore its existence.</p>

	<p>It was Wan’er’s power. It seemed to be very beautiful, but it was a deadly thing to Qin Jing Zhen.</p>

	<p>When the gold light corroded him, Qin Jing Zhen’s gene chains had become gold. Now, 10% of his gene chains were
		gold. If this kept going on, when it reached 30%, Qin Jing Zhen’s body would be destroyed. He would be a dead
		man.</p>

	<p>Qin Jing Zhen had three powers. Suppressing the spread of the gold light did not seem to work very well. It was
		hard to stop the gold light completely in its tracks. According to the speed of the gold light, Qin Jing Zhen
		really had less than a year to live.</p>

	<p>Han Sen pulled his finger back. He looked at Qin Jing Zhen and frowned.</p>

	<p>“I know my condition,” Qin Jing Zhen said. “You can tell me what you think without beating around the bush. Be
		direct.”</p>

	<p>Han Sen nodded and said, “According to the examination I have conducted on your body, if there is no other power
		to heal you, you only have one more year to live.” “Teacher Jian said that too,” Qin Jing Zhen said with a wry
		smile. “It looks like I really am going to die this time.” Although he was a king, he could not face his
		mortality. Qin Jing Zhen really did not want to die yet.</p>

	<p>“Maybe not,” Han Sen said after a brief hesitation.</p>

	<p>Qin Jing Zhen’s eyes immediately grew brighter. He looked at Han Sen and asked, “Mister Han, do you have a way to
		fix my wounds?”</p>

	<p>Qin Jing Zhen looked for Han Sen because he thought he now had hope. This was his final hope. He had consulted
		with many others. even the Annihilation God Spirits that protected the Qin family were unable to do anything for
		the wounds Qin Jing Zhen had sustained. Qin Jing Zhen had already given up, but Jian Bu Gu was the one to
		suggest seeking out Han Sen and see if he could help him out.</p>

	<p>After thinking for a moment, Han Sen said, “I am not sure I can completely heal you, but I do have a way to
		extend your life for about three to five years. In the time I can give you, perhaps a more permanent solution
		can be found.”</p>

	<p>Qin Jing Zhen developed a wry smile and said, “I would like to live another three to five years. You might not
		believe me when I tell you this, but I am not afraid of death. There is something I do not want to leave behind
		unfinished.”</p>

	<p>“Is this because of the crown prince?” Han Sen asked.</p>

	<p>“Mister Han, you really know me,” Qin Jing Zhen said with a sigh. “The Qin Kingdom is the greatest kingdom in the
		universe. It is very powerful. It is stronger than the other six kingdoms, but it is also different from the
		other six kingdoms. The Qin Kingdom is a kingdom founded on law. The king is the highest. Without a king, other
		departments can continue to function. The country will still operate, but my Bai son is still young. He still
		wants to play. For a boy his age to run a country, it would be terrible. I am afraid he will mess up the fate of
		the kingdom.”</p>

	<p>Qin Jing Zhen said it clearly, and Han Sen understood what he meant. If Qin Bai succeeded his father on the
		throne, someone might steal his power and operate the boy like a puppet.</p>

	<p>“The Qin Kingdom is in trouble. There are so many problems facing us. I would like to live a few more years so I
		can give my son a safe country.” Qin Jing Zhen looked at Han Sen seriously and said, “Mister Han, no matter the
		price I must pay, please let me live a few years longer. I do not want to die now.”</p>

	<p>“I will do what I can. It will not be hard extending your life for three to five years more, but any longer than
		that will be dependent on your body.” Han Sen paused before saying, “The skills I use will have their effect on
		you. To use this method, there is a condition.”</p>
