    <p>
      Han Sen and Ji Qing sat at a table face-to-face. Many people bid passing
      greetings to her, indicating her familiarity and popularity with the
      people there.
    </p>

    <p>
      When Han Sen looked around, he noticed a battle stage. Two people were
      currently atop it, in a friendly bout of black and white boxing.
    </p>

    <p>
      Ji Qing was very good at black and white boxing. It was something that
      helped train your psychological fortitude, and it wasn&#8217;t something
      won by outright strength alone.
    </p>

    <p>
      For power in that game, your mind had to be strong. If it wasn&#8217;t,
      you&#8217;d be carrying an unloaded gun.
    </p>

    <p>
      Since Ji Qing was good at this, she brought Han Sen in the desire of
      testing his mind.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Sister Qing, it has been a while since you last visited. And you
      brought a man with you; is he your new boyfriend? My, my, you go through
      them quickly!&#8221; A stylish young man approached and seemed to be quite
      close with her. He immediately sat down and spoke to her casually.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Tu Bin! Do not talk such rot. This is my brother-in-law, Han Sen.
      You must have heard of him, yes? He is the big hero that defeated the
      royal shura Yu Qielan. He is not like you.&#8221; When Ji Qing said that,
      she conveyed a certain amount of seriousness, but it was betrayed by
      lively eyes that suggested a smile.
    </p>

    <p>
      Tu Bin was the son of a boss of a financial department someplace. His
      style exuded the look of a young gangster, but it was far from his true
      identity. He was rather famous in the realm of black and white boxing, and
      he was only slightly inferior to Ji Qing.
    </p>

    <p>
      Tu Bin and Ji Qing&#8217;s relationship was not as close as one might
      suspect, however. They had no personal conflict with each other, but they
      frequently came here to spar and battle against each other with a mutual
      respect.
    </p>

    <p>
      They did not hate each other, but they fought frequently. They never
      battled elsewhere, just here to help each other become better at this
      specific sport. Beyond the confines of this area, they did whatever two
      young friends might get up to.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Ah, you are the big Hero Han I&#8217;ve heard about? My
      apologies.&#8221; It was difficult to discern whether Tu Bin&#8217;s words
      were sincere or possessed undertones of sarcasm.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Yes, so, presuming you have no other business to take up with me, I
      suggest you go elsewhere. Do not disturb me right now,&#8221; Ji Qing
      plainly told Tu Bin.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;If you came here alone, I would most certainly remove myself from
      your presence. But today, Hero Han has come. If I did not ask him to
      practice with me, that would be a shameful missed opportunity.&#8221; Tu
      Bin then turned to look at Han Sen and continued, &#8220;Hero Han, would
      you like to provide me some tips?&#8221;
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Nah, I haven&#8217;t played this game in a long time,&#8221; Han
      Sen casually said.
    </p>

    <p>
      Tu Bin looked ready to say something, but he was interrupted by sudden
      loud noises coming from beyond a doorway. It looked like something was
      underway.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;What&#8217;s that ruckus all about?&#8221; Tu Bin asked, wanting to
      keep talking to Han Sen. No one replied.
    </p>

    <p>
      The people who came to this place were typically quite young. Although Tu
      Bin had quite a background, there were a lot more people with far greater
      histories behind them.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen and Ji Qing looked to where the noises came from, and they noticed
      a lot of people had gathered to chant someone&#8217;s name.
    </p>

    <p>
      There were so many people, Han Sen wasn&#8217;t sure what was going on. He
      activated his dongxuan aura in a bid to learn more.
    </p>

    <p>
      What he saw surprised him. It was all started by one person, and that
      person was Yi Dongmu. He had actually come to this place, and he looked
      quite popular, too.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;This is not fair. Why are handsome men so popular
      everywhere?&#8221; Han Sen&#8217;s heart felt betrayed. He was a hero, but
      no one really seemed to recognize him. Yet Yi Dongmu was receiving all the
      attention in the world.
    </p>

    <p>
      These thoughts did not immediately leave Han Sen&#8217;s mind, either. It
      didn&#8217;t feel right, so he touched his cheek and thought,
      &#8220;It&#8217;s not right. I am handsome. I must look better than that
      Yi Dongmu, but why am I not receiving his treatment? Do people just love a
      miserable emo more than they do a genuinely beautiful man?&#8221;
    </p>

    <p>
      As Han Sen contemplated all this, Ji Qing and Tu Bin stood up. They too
      looked excited, seeing Yi Dongmu ascend the battle stage.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Little Qing, what are you looking at?&#8221; Han Sen asked Ji Qing.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;I am looking at Yi Dongmu! Who else would I be looking at?&#8221;
      Ji Qing said, as she started walking forward to take a seat closer to the
      stage so she could watch Yi Dongmu perform.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Is he that good a person to look at?&#8221; Han Sen was genuinely
      confused.
    </p>

    <p>
      Although Han Sen was willing to admit Yi Dongmu was a little handsome,
      others were keen to suggest Yi Dongmu might be more handsome than he
      himself. And that was too much for Han Sen. Ji Qing was a renowned lady of
      the Ji family, too; there was no way she&#8217;d regress into another
      member of the Yi Dongmu fangirl horde, was there?
    </p>

    <p>
      Ji Qing opened her mouth but did not say anything. Tu Bin looked annoyed
      by what Han Sen asked and said, &#8220;Hero Han, you may have beat the
      shura and shone a light on the Alliance, but I do not advocate or
      appreciate what you have just asked. Yi Dongmu is a god to the people of
      this Martial Hall. He beats everyone in the central galaxy and never, ever
      loses! You may be strong, but in black and white boxing, I don&#8217;t
      think you stand a chance against Yi Dongmu. Only someone like Dollar could
      do that.&#8221;
    </p>

    <p>
      Ji Qing was going to say something, but he covered all the bases for her
      and she agreed with every last word.
    </p>

    <p>
      If the ordinary elites in the Martial Hall could not beat Han Sen, there
      was little to gain. But if Han Sen went up against Yi Dongmu and defeated
      him, his true strength would most certainly be revealed. That would prove
      a thing or two to Ji Qing.
    </p>

    <p>
      Naturally, however, Ji Qing did not believe Han Sen could defeat Yi
      Dongmu. She only wanted to gauge his strength in comparison to the others.
    </p>

    <p>
      But Ji Qing squinted her eyes and smiled. She said, &#8220;Tu Bin, I am
      not fond of what you just said. My brother-in-law can beat a royal shura,
      so I&#8217;m sure he can beat Yi Dongmu.&#8221;
    </p>

    <p>
      Ji Qing did not say this in earnest. In her heart, she said to herself,
      &#8220;I am sorry Yi Dongmu, I have no choice. I do support you, but if I
      am to get Han Sen to reveal his true strength, he must go up against
      you.&#8221;
    </p>

    <p>
      When Tu Bin heard this, he became infuriated. Yi Dongmu was not only his
      friend, but a god to the place.
    </p>

    <p>
      Tu Bin merely stood up, clapped his hands, and shouted, &#8220;Quiet!
      Everyone quiet!&#8221;
    </p>

    <p>
      Everyone looked in his direction, unsure of what was happening. Someone
      who was friendly with Tu Bin interrupted the sudden silence and asked,
      &#8220;Tu Bin? Tu Bin, what the hell?&#8221;
    </p>

    <p>
      Tu Bin then jumped on top of a chair. He pointed his finger at Ji Qing and
      said, &#8220;Our Ji family lady, Ji Qing, just said her brother-in-law,
      this Han Sen—the big Hero Han who beat the royal shura Yu Qielan—could
      beat our Yi God in black and white boxing.&#8221;
    </p>

    <p>Boo!</p>

    <p>
      Boo noises erupted all across the room, with not a single speck of support
      for Han Sen.
