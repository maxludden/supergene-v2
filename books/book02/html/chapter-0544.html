    <p>
      Han Sen had always needed a hyper geno art for underwater fighting. To
      fight in the water was completely different to fighting on land. The
      effects of water pressure and resistances were considerable. The shift in
      the effectiveness of certain land hyper geno arts to how they performed in
      the water likewise very acute.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen had many S-Class licenses of the Saint Hall, so spending one more
      did not concern him much. And now here he was, arriving in the Saint Hall
      to purchase an additional hyper geno art.
    </p>

    <p>
      Humans found it hard to hunt creatures in the water, so there were not
      many underwater-based hyper geno art to select from. Han Sen&#8217;s
      choices were strictly limited.
    </p>

    <p>
      Out of the eight underwater ones available, he picked one S-Class licensed
      hyper geno art. He did not dwell on the purchase too much, and quickly
      bought it outright.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen had picked the S-Class licensed hyper geno art called
      &#8220;Tide&#8221;. It was a water-based skill that allowed its user to
      draw power from the surrounding water itself and so amplify their own
      powers.
    </p>

    <p>
      Although it did not sound particularly special, Tide&#8217;s amplified
      power was nothing to be sniffy about.
    </p>

    <p>
      After he drank the exclusive geno solution for Tide, Han Sen returned to
      the shelter and drove the Crystal Palace into the sea so he could practice
      his new ability.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen spent most of his time practicing Tide, but for the Dongxuan
      Sutra, he decided to only practice one cycle each day. That practice
      itself only took two minutes.
    </p>

    <p>
      This wasn&#8217;t because Han Sen did not want to continue - it was
      because after one cycle, his body was already filled to the brim with
      power. Practicing further would not deliver any more benefits.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen guessed it was because his body had not yet reached the status of
      a Celestial Being. There was a limit to how much his body could take.
    </p>

    <p>
      There was a further natural benefit from Han Sen practicing Tide. Ordinary
      evolvers could not breathe underwater, which made it impossible for them
      to dive and explore the deep sea. Their inability to breathe underwater
      was an extreme handicap for any of their sea-bound ventures.
    </p>

    <p>
      But now Han Sen was free to explore and practice within the deep sea as
      much as he wanted. He was not unlike a yaksha, forming ripples and waves
      across the sea. His swimming speed had increased a great deal, and he
      could have been mistaken for a creature that had been born and lived in
      the sea all its life.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Not bad. Not bad. Although I can&#8217;t yet perform my skills and
      abilities as well as I do on land, 80% of my power now translates to my
      talents in the water. I will be able to battle sacred-blood creatures
      now.&#8221; Han Sen was tremendously excited about his rising powers.
    </p>

    <p>
      The rate at which Han Sen could learn and effectively utilize Tide was
      exponentially faster than he had predicted. He wasn&#8217;t sure if it was
      because he had learnt the Dongxuan Sutra, but whenever he was in the water
      now, he felt no resistance. He was like a water fairy.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;I need to find a sacred-blood creature out in the sea, so I can
      test my abilities on it.&#8221; Han Sen&#8217;s exhilaration was
      unbridled. Recently, he has taken to eating the flesh of various mutant
      creatures, which led to his mutant geno points increasing a good deal, but
      his sacred geno points had been at a stand-still.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen drove the Crystal Palace deep underwater in the hopes of finding a
      solo sacred-blood creature. He would also have to find one with a head
      that wasn&#8217;t too large, otherwise he would not be able to eat it.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Why do the creatures beneath the sea have such big heads?&#8221;
      Han Sen caught sight of a sea monster that looked not unlike a dragon,
      with a body that was over a hundred meters long. It swam dangerously close
      past the Crystal Palace, which made Han Sen gulp.
    </p>

    <p>
      The views one could observe down in the deep sea were astoundingly
      beautiful, fascinating and otherworldly. A large band of sea bugs now
      caught Han Sen&#8217;s attention, and they shone purple as they winded
      their course across the seabed.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;What are these little creatures?&#8221; Han Sen watched the
      football-sized sea bugs through the windows of the Crystal Palace with
      great curiosity.
    </p>

    <p>
      They rather resembled sea urchins. They had circular bodies that had
      numerous thorny spikes which emitted light. It was quite beautiful to see
      them shining so.
    </p>

    <p>
      But after what occurred with the red-demon jellyfish, Han Sen was not
      willing to underestimate any creature that lived beneath the sea. There
      were many thousands of those sea bugs, and until he learnt more about the
      powers each possessed, he wasn&#8217;t willing to blindly venture out and
      start attacking.
    </p>

    <p>
      He summoned the golden rock worm king and suited it up in armor. The
      golden rock worm king&#8217;s defenses were now almost up to the level of
      a sacred-blood creature hailing from the Second Shelter. This was the
      perfect opportunity to test out its abilities and resiliencies.
    </p>

    <p>
      If they were to meet a sacred-blood creature out there, the golden rock
      worm king was definitely sturdy enough not to die too quickly. Han Sen
      could have the golden rock worm king retreat whenever he chose.
    </p>

    <p>
      The golden rock worm king had its battle mode initiated, and it dove out
      into the dark waters.
    </p>

    <p>
      Before it could get close to the sea bugs, the target of its venture had
      already taken heed of its approach. The spikes that shone purple now
      discharged a violet solution of some sort. All of a sudden, the water of
      the area became a thick and murky purple.
    </p>

    <p>
      When the golden rock worm king touched this purple emulsion, the super pet
      armor corroded instantly. Understanding what has happening, Han Sen
      quickly recalled the golden rock worm king.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Whoa, those are some powerful sea bugs!&#8221; Han Sen summoned his
      own armor and glyph, and then reached out to touch the purple liquid
      himself. Fortunately, the purple fluids could not corrode his own armor.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen did not hesitate. He jumped into the water and swam directly
      through the murky compound. He was almost like a shark, homing in on the
      urchin-looking sea bugs.
    </p>

    <p>
      The sea bugs seemed to feel even more threatened, and so they squirted out
      more of their corrosive purple toxin. The water began turning black and
      Han Sen struggled to see anything.
    </p>

    <p>
      Luckily, he could outpace the sea bugs he was after. He sprinted in front
      of one and quickly waved his ghost-pawed claws to kill it.
    </p>

    <blockquote>
      <p>
        &#8220;Mutant Creature Hunted: Poison-Spike Sea Bug. The Beast Soul Was
        Not Acquired. Consume Its Flesh To Obtain A Random Amount Of Mutant Geno
        Points, Between Zero And Ten.&#8221;
      </p>
    </blockquote>

    <p>
      Han Sen was shocked. If the sea bugs were mutant creatures, that meant
      there was a many thousands of them in front of him.
    </p>

    <p>
      It was rare to see so many mutant creatures together on land. The value of
      what he had stumbled onto was difficult to comprehend.
    </p>

    <p>
      Consumed with excitement, Han Sen was overwhelmed at the number of mutant
      creatures he could now freely hunt. The likelihood of obtaining the beast
      soul of a sea bug was all but guaranteed, as a beast soul was sure to drop
      from the thousands of mutant creatures that stretched out before him.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen immediately swam out to kill as many sea bugs as he could. Like a
      swarm of angry wasps, they all tried to spray their toxic liquid to deter
      their attacker. As he came near, they also tried to put their thorns into
      him directly.
    </p>

    <p>
      Under the buff provided by the double Berserk sacred blood beast soul, the
      mutant sea bugs had no chance of piercing his golden armor. Their poison
      was useless against him. Han Sen casually attacked and slew a fair number
      of sea bugs.
    </p>

    <p>
      But the poison-spike sea bugs had their own form of intelligence. After
      Han Sen had killed a dozen of them, they noticed their inability to
      compete their hunter, and they all tried to escape. Panicking, they tried
      to swim as far away from Han Sen as they could.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen had not yet acquired the beast soul he was looking for, so he was
      not planning on letting them get away so easily. He fervently chased them,
      and fiercely swung his ghost-pawed claws. With each swing, the satisfying
      sound of a fresh kill struck his eardrums.
    </p>

    <blockquote>
      <p>

        Been Acquired. Consume Its Flesh To Obtain A Random Numeric Amount Of
        Mutant Geno Points, Between Zero And Ten.&#8221;
      </p>
    </blockquote>

    <p>
      Han Sen&#8217;s heart was delighted at obtaining a new beast soul. He
      tried to push his luck and kill a few more to collect another, but in the
      corner of his vision he saw a giant poison-spike sea bug headed in his
      direction.
    </p>

    <p>
      This sea bug was like a hot-air balloon, and it shone out of the darkness
      of the sea like a renegade neutron star. Its brightness made it impossible
      for Han Sen to open his eyes at all.
