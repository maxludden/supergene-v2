    <p>
      Luo Sulan smiled and said, &#8220;Technically, there are two problems.
      First, I was exiled from my family for running off to marry your father.
      As such, I can hardly be considered a part of the Luo family. Second,
      you&#8217;re asking why we were bullied by our second uncles and aunties?
      That&#8217;s a little harder to explain. We owe them; let&#8217;s leave it
      at that.&#8221;
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;We owe them? What is that supposed to mean?&#8221; Han Sen
      didn&#8217;t expect that answer, and he ended up looking at Luo Sulan with
      surprise.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;I&#8217;m not sure. But that is what your father told me, actually.
      He never told me the details, however.&#8221; Luo Sulan smiled as she
      spoke.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;My father&#8230; did he really die?&#8221; Han Sen&#8217;s heart
      always held onto the glimmer of hope his father might still be alive.
      Following his accident, no body had actually been retrieved, after all.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Honestly? I don&#8217;t know. I have spent many years investigating
      his death myself, but I have yet to unearth another truth. Still, I do
      believe your father is alive.&#8221; Luo Sulan&#8217;s eyes displayed
      certainty in this belief.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen moved his lips as if to say something, but those words never came.
      Instead, he ended up saying, &#8220;Mom, your fighting skills must be
      powerful.&#8221;
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;They&#8217;re okay. Your grandfather taught me fairly well,&#8221;
      Luo Sulan smiled and said.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Then why don&#8217;t you teach me what grandfather taught
      you?&#8221; Han Sen asked Luo Sulan with vibrant eyes, that possessed a
      hint of disappointment he hadn&#8217;t been offered such teachings before.
    </p>

    <p>
      Luo Sulan smiled at Han Sen and suggestively asked, &#8220;Are you sure I
      did not teach you?&#8221;
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Of course. I think I would know if you had taught me
      something,&#8221; Han Sen said.
    </p>

    <p>
      Luo Sulan reached out her hand to grab Han Sen by the ear and said,
      &#8220;My stupid son, I cannot believe you have no clue about what I
      taught you. Do you think your decision-making abilities, fighting
      abilities, learning abilities, timing abilities, predictive abilities,
      thinking abilities, your world-view, your attitude to do things, the
      principles of being a human, and your reactive abilities were self-taught
      or natural attributes which you were born possessing?&#8221;
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen was shocked, having always believed himself to be supremely
      talented through self-education. Now he understood that ever since he was
      small, the reason his mother left him to his own devices often was so he
      could become more independent. Even when it came to playing games, she had
      trained his abilities on the sly.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen then remembered the game of Red Hands, which he frequently played
      with his mother. They played it more than anything together, and only now
      did he realize that this was what had enabled him to have such good timing
      and reactions, and also allowed him to read other people so well.
    </p>

    <p>
      There were a lot of other similar things. And he was now flabbergasted to
      realize that throughout his childhood, his mother had taught and guided
      him seamlessly, without making the training an apparent chore. Luo Sulan
      had a great influence in his youth and had a bigger hand in shaping his
      personality than he had previously given her credit for.
    </p>

    <p>
      But still, these powers she had taught were fairly ordinary. There was
      nothing special or exclusive about what she had taught him, yet it was his
      excellence in these departments that allowed him to later standout amongst
      others.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;But you never taught me the Luo family&#8217;s hyper geno
      art.&#8221; Saying this, Han Sen sounded upset again.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;In this world, what makes you strong? You. If you are powerful
      enough, it does not matter which hyper geno art you learn; if you are
      strong, you are strong. If I instead opted to teach you the most powerful
      Qi Gong there is, it wouldn&#8217;t have mattered. With low base traits,
      you&#8217;d be a noob no matter what. Who you are as a person is what
      defines your ultimate power, and you have done just fine without that
      hyper geno art. I taught you the necessities for becoming a powerful
      figure in this crazy world, and from what I can tell, it paid off. That
      was the task I gave myself, and teaching that hyper geno art was not in my
      interest.&#8221;
    </p>

    <p>
      Luo Sulan stopped talking for a brief moment. She sighed, then continued
      to say, &#8220;And I left the Luo family, anyway. I have no association
      with them, if you disregard my name. The last thing I wanted was you
      getting involved with them, needlessly.&#8221;
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen noticed Luo Sulan had no desire to talk about the Luo family she
      had left behind, so he didn&#8217;t push the subject further. Instead, he
      asked, &#8220;Are these really the relics from my great
      grandfather?&#8221;
    </p>

    <p>
      Luo Sulan nodded and said, &#8220;Yes. Your father gave them to me.&#8221;
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;So, great grandfather really is Instructor Han?&#8221; Han Sen went
      silent after asking the question, and simply stared at his mother.
    </p>

    <p>
      Luo Sulan had a wry smile and responded by saying, &#8220;I would like to
      know this, too. I thought your father was just an average, funny guy. He
      doesn&#8217;t quite seem so average anymore, does he?&#8221;
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen found it difficult to believe that she knew so little about his
      father. If she did know more than she was letting on, he suspected there
      was something she thought best not to mention.
    </p>

    <p>
      But Han Sen knew he wasn&#8217;t going to get any answers, so he
      didn&#8217;t ask anything else about him.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Mom, do you know what super geno points are?&#8221; Right now, they
      were back home. And feeling like a door-to-door, sleazy salesman, Han Sen
      popped the sneaky question.
    </p>

    <p>
      Luo Sulan gave Han Sen a complicated look and said, &#8220;I have taught
      you many things. But what I have taught you all goes to aid you in
      achieving an easy life for yourself. Your cleverness and abilities have
      exceeded all my wildest expectations. As good as this may be, it is not
      without its downsides. If you were merely an ordinary person, you&#8217;d
      be safe. By being someone special, more often than not, you may find
      yourself facing death.&#8221;
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen wasn&#8217;t quite sure what she was getting at, so he just looked
      at her.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;If you have willingly selected the road you currently tread, then
      by all means advance and keep going. But it is a lonely road, a
      less-traveled path that only holds room for one. Even your dearest person
      in this world will be unable to help you. But if you think you cannot go
      any further, then by all means stop. At least that way you&#8217;ll live
      longer.&#8221;
    </p>

    <p>
      Luo Sulan stroked Han Sen&#8217;s head with love and said, &#8220;I wish
      you the best of luck, my son. Perhaps one day you will indeed become
      someone of much renown.&#8221;
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Mom, I never studied much. Could you say what you just said in a
      simpler way?&#8221; Han Sen&#8217;s face looked very embarrassed, as he
      couldn&#8217;t understand a thing.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;There is no need for you to understand. Just be who you are. You
      have always followed your heart, in the deeds of the past and present.
      Adhere to this simple philosophy as you continue your march, now and into
      the future.&#8221; Luo Sulan ruffled Han Sen&#8217;s hair into a mess,
      pinched his cheek, smiled, and then said, &#8220;I actually have high
      expectations of you.&#8221;
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen felt so helpless. His mother was overall reluctant to say much and
      didn&#8217;t provide many answers to the questions for which he sought
      resolution. All he had learned was how powerful his mother&#8217;s family
      had actually been, but it did not help. The details were scarce, and in
      regards to his father, Han Sen was still unsure whether he was dead or
      alive. He ended up with more questions than answers.
    </p>

    <p>
      But the engagement plans went well, and that took a load off Han
      Sen&#8217;s shoulders. Now, he could finally place his name on Ji Yanran.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Hm, next up; how do I get rid of this troublesome fairy?&#8221; Han
      Sen had been kept busy for two weeks. When he returned to the shelter in
      the desert, the fairy was still vigilant outside the walls of the
      Yellowstone City. It looked like he had no choice, and they&#8217;d have
      to fight each other until one of them dropped, no matter what.
