<h2>Sanctuary’s Gate</h2>
<h3>Chapter 1733</h3>

<p>A strange power burst out from the officer. It became a blast in
the air and then quickly disappeared. After one second, a vortex
manifested in the sky. It was light, and the dimensions inside
whirled and twisted.</p>
<p>The sky was like a lake with a whirlpool. It was scary, and even
elites like Gu Qingcheng frowned.</p>
<p>Stay Up Late’s face changed, and he said, “No! He wants to open
the sanctuary gate!”</p>
<p>“What does that mean? I thought it was always open!” Han Yufei
asked.</p>
<p>Stay Up Late quickly explained, “The sanctuary is open. But that
simply means that it isn’t locked for beings that wish to exit It
easy for creatures to leave this universe, as when they generate a
geno armor, they can summon and push a gate open. Even if they
don’t want to leave.”</p>
<p>“But the door is still closed to creatures from the outside. The
door currently only allows travel in one direction. Now that the
officer is opening it, creatures on the other side can enter. When
the crystallizers went out, that is why they were destroyed.”</p>
<p>Stay Up Late said all this, and then shouted, “Officer, what is
it that you want? Do you want to repeat the tragedy that befell the
crystallizers?”</p>
<p>The officer looked calm, but his eyes glinted with excitement.
He looked at the rumbling sky and said, “Night, you do not
understand. We cannot stay here. We have to exit. No matter what we
do, it is imperative that I go out.”</p>
<p>“You aren’t just leaving. You are destroying the sanctuary! You
do not have to open the door if you wish to go out!” Stay Up Late
shouted.</p>
<p>“Why are you still talking to him? Just kill him already.” Xie
Qing King jumped towards the officer with a silver light.</p>
<p>The officer waved his fist and blasted Xie Qing King away,
though. The silver light shattered as his body fell to the ground
and produced a deep crater.</p>
<p>Xie Qing King managed to get back up, but he was bleeding from
the corners of his lips.</p>
<p>“He is getting stronger!” Gu Qingcheng’s face changed.</p>
<p>“He used his body to open the gate. He is going to go over the
maximum power threshold believed attainable,” Stay Up Late
said.</p>
<p>“Didn’t you say geno armor can’t level up? How is he increasing
strength like this?” Gu Qingcheng asked.</p>
<p>“I don’t know. His presence is a little strange.” Stay Up Late
shook his head, and he looked at the officer who was hovering in
the sky.</p>
<p>“We have to kill him to end this.” Little Angel looked calm. She
summoned her holy white armor and swung her angel sword. Golden
Growler roared, and his golden armor shone. He was charging a roar
blast at the officer.</p>
<p>Gu Qingcheng didn’t dare slow down, and she immediately swung
her blade.</p>
<p>Ji Yanran’s crystal shoes and Stay Up Late’s Western King Sword
were both headed for the same target.</p>
<p>Many scary powers were going converging, but the officer
remained motionless. Perhaps it was because he was leveling up, or
there was another sinister motive entirely.</p>
<p>Boom!</p>
<p>All that horrendous power went against the officer, producing an
explosion that was scarier than a supernova.</p>
<p>Luckily, the impact was wholly in the sky. If it had gone
against the ground, the entirety of Planet Roca would have been
destroyed.</p>
<p>When the power died off, Stay Up Late was shocked. The officer
had not been killed. He hadn’t even been injured.</p>
<p>But his body had experienced a number of weird changes. The
Southern King Fire Wings were being eaten by the armor he wore.</p>
<p>They were actually being eaten.</p>
<p>The officer’s black armor had a number of black cracks, like
many mouths from hell that were gnawing and gobbling up the
wings.</p>
<p>The power they cast had been absorbed by the armor, and that was
why nothing had come of their strikes.</p>
<p>“This is the presence of the other race. You…” Stay Up Late’s
face changed.</p>
<p>“Yes. Ever since the disaster of the crystallizers, I have
searched out the leftovers that destroyed them. After all this
time, I have found a way to infuse it with me and make my geno
armor more powerful. There is a price to pay, however. If it wasn’t
for you, I wouldn’t have bothered doing it</p>
<p>The officer was in the sky, looking calm and passionate.</p>
<p>“Why? Why do you have to do this? Does going out mean that much
to you? You will destroy the world we live in, just so you can
leave?” Stay Up Late looked at him and said.</p>
<p>“Night, you don’t understand. You never will. It’s because
you’re not here yet” The officer was being honest.</p>
<p>“Then tell me what it is that you are afraid of!” Stay Up Late
shouted.</p>
<p>“What am I afraid of?” The officer looked to the sky, where the
vortex whirled. There was some black stuff in there, and it was
spreading, like a black hole.</p>
<p>Inside the black hole, something scary was emerging. It sounded
like some sordid, frightening beast.</p>
<p>“Officer, you really want the sanctuaries to have a repeat of
the first disaster!” Stay Up Late shouted.</p>
<p>The officer laughed and said, “The crystallizer disaster? That
was nothing. If we don’t get out, something one million times worse
will happen.”</p>
<p>After the officer said that, something roared. A dragon-like
creature came out of the black hole.</p>
<p>Everyone’s face changed. Only the officer looked greedy.</p>
<p>“Come! You guys know what this world looks like.” The officer
ran to Stay Up Late and touched his shoulder.</p>
<p>The armor on his hand was like a mouth, biting into Stay Up
Late’s shoulder. It chomped into Stay Up Late’s flesh and armor.
Stay Up Late held back the pain and swung his Western King Sword at
the villain.</p>
<p>The officer grabbed it, though. He didn’t break it, but cracks
started to form across the blade. They were starting to spread.</p>
<p>Stay Up Late wanted to pull his Western King Sword back, but it
wouldn’t budge. And when he gave a firm tug, it went katcha and
broke. Half of it was swallowed by the officer’s armor.</p>
