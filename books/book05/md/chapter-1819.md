Yisha frowned. It was obvious that the man had given her a challenge that was harder than she initially thought

Han Sen had already generated his geno armor, so it was too late for him to change technique now. Aside from humans, not many creatures could practice two geno arts in order to create two types of geno armor.

That was because the genes of others were stable, and accomplishing this was outside the realm of possibility. The genes of humans were unstable enough to allow this, but it was still closer to the side that did not allow the fabrication of a second geno armor.

So, Yisha did not consider trying to get Han Sen to practice another geno art and start from scratch. She didn’t think it would be possible.

Breaking his geno armor and getting him to rebuild it would be a fruitless endeavor as well. It would permanently damage his body. She could take that risk if he was just an ordinary nobody, but Han Sen had a deified feather. If Kong Fei found out what she had done to him, she might incur his wrath.

“This geno art is harmful, but if he can finish learning the basics, there is the chance of it becoming something very strong and beneficial. Han Sen has managed to generate a geno armor with it already, and aside from deified elites, that shouldn’t be possible. And once an elite rises to become deified, their body is locked down. They cannot generate a geno armor, but this man can. Perhaps there really is a chance.” Yisha looked at Han Sen as she thought.

“A geno art that cannot be practiced, and yet he has managed to generate a geno armor with it. If he can evolve a second time and become a Noble, with that perfect geno armament, his strength would far exceed that of other Nobles. After that, practicing would be much less difficult for him, and he might achieve a great deal. It’s just this first step will be really difficult to take. Very hard, indeed.”

Han Sen saw Yisha staring at him and noticed that she wasn’t saying a word. He thought to himself, “Did I waste too many of her resources? Does she no longer want me? That’s fine. Just let me go without killing me, please.”

Han Sen was overthinking things a little, though. Yisha had taken him as a student as part of a wager. And that aside, she was not the sort of person that would give up easily.

“Han Sen, let me ask you something. I can force you to be my student, but I want this to be something that you yourself desire. I am happy to accept you, but I won’t make you do this if it is against your will. I can give you a job, though, and you won’t have to worry about anything,” Yisha suddenly proposed.

“Of course I am willing to be here!” Han Sen hastily told her. He did not know if she was just testing his resolve or not, so he didn’t want to share his true opinion. He spoke with firm confidence.

“My training will be hard. Not everyone is able to accept this. And if you are my student, you have to keep that flame of resolve stoked and push through the pain, even when it hurts. If you cannot handle the pain of this, I can give you the job of an officer instead. Regardless of what happens, I want you to know that you do not have to worry about anything else in your life.” Yisha spoke coldly, but she was still staring at Han Sen fondly.

“I will endure whatever pain comes my way and go as far as I possibly can. I will give up anything and give my everything, as long as you don’t give up on me. I won’t disappoint you.” Han Sen paused for a moment. With a sad look, he went on to tell her, “On Mosi Mountain, Stay Up Late and I were the recipients of deified feathers. Those high-level races only wanted Stay Up Late, and they ignored me completely. I want to practice too in order to go further. Please, give me the chance no one else did. If I am given the possibility to reach for the stars, I don’t mind dying in the effort. Anything is better than staying still, rotting in place.”

By the end of his speech, Han Sen felt excited. Even he almost believed what he was telling her.

“Good. If you have this much courage and sense of purpose, I will give you the opportunity. I will help you go further and make those other fool races regret what they told you.” Yisha thought Han Sen was speaking from the heart, and she wholeheartedly believed his words. But after this, she still went on to say, “Remember your own words today. I won’t blame you if you give up right now and settle for the comfort of a quiet and good life. But if I spend a lot of resources raising you up, only for you to eventually give up and try to run away, you will pay the ultimate price. Not even a deified elite could save you from the destruction I’ll bring down on you. Do you understand me?”

“If I try to run away, my head is yours to remove.” Han Sen’s answer sounded serious.

What Han Sen said, though, was not entirely a lie. The last few sentences were actually quite sincere.

Han Sen was not willing to back down. If he did not aim high in the geno universe, he could not survive. And he couldn’t protect his friends and family when they made the jump. He needed to get stronger, so he could get back Golden Growler and Littleflower. There was no way he could back down now.

“Okay. Then, let us continue.” Yisha could tell Han Sen was sincere and true to his words, and she was very impressed by him.

Yisha was giving him a chance to leave because it would be hard to begin what he had started. Merely getting past the first stage would cost a lot.

She wanted to find out what sort of character Han Sen had before committing. If Han Sen was weak and impatient, she would rather give up and lose the bet No one could promise her pursuit with Han Sen would pay off, so she had to learn more and consider things properly.

Han Sen’s answers and behavior had satisfied her. She was no longer second-guessing herself; she was willing to give this ago.

If Yisha knew Han Sen just wanted to use up her resources to get through The Story of Genes, she’d have been very angry.

“Continue,” Yisha said.

“Continue what?” Han Sen was shocked, and not sure what she was alluding to.

“Continue eating, of course!” Yisha said. She waved her hand, and a beautiful Rebate brought forth a number of elixirs.

“Consume them one by one, and cast your geno arts. Do this as many times as you have to. I will make you a Noble, and not even the gods themselves can stop it.” Yisha raised her head, asserting her feeling of confidence.

“Yes. I won’t disappoint you. I will start consuming them now.” Immediately after saying that, Han Sen gulped down the contents of the first bottle.
