<h2>Undying Bird Challenge</h2>
<h3>Chapter 2227</h3>

<p>Han Sen smiled. He did not mind the threat. The Demon Bug King
Bai Sema wouldn’t even buckle to the attacks of a King class
creature. Therefore, he did not think he had to worry about the
tiny little lava bugs.</p>
<p>“Undying Bird really resides on this island?” Ji Qing asked
curiously.</p>
<p>Bao’er was lying down on Han Sen’s shoulder. Her eyes curiously
observed the small island they had landed on.</p>
<p>The island was not big, and with Han Sen’s speed, it would not
take long to walk across it. The island did have a spectacular
amount of flora, though. It was practically a rainforest. Insects
and beasts roamed all about it.</p>
<p>Standing on the island, you would not feel the heat of the lava
that was nearby. It felt like a summertime place where you would
want to sleep away the hours.</p>
<p>Bai Wei did not answer, and she kept marching toward the jungle.
Han Sen expected to encounter danger, but he soon realized that the
creatures around were just ordinary animals. They weren’t even
xenogeneics, and they most certainly weren’t threatening.</p>
<p>In the center of the island was a white mountain. It was only a
few hundred meters tall, but it looked like a big steamed bun. The
peak of the mountain cradled a broken tower of sorts. It looked
very old, and it had decayed over the years. It was no longer
straight, and it looked ready to fall apart.</p>
<p>They walked before the foot of the mountain, then Bai Wei looked
toward the broken tower atop the peak and shouted, “King Bai’s heir
has come. Is the Undying Bird at home?” Her voice echoed across the
expanse of the island, but no response came from the tower, so she
shouted again.</p>
<p>After she shouted three times, a door in the broken tower atop
the peak opened. It did so with a long, drawn-out squeak.</p>
<p>Han Sen and Bao’er’s eyes opened wide as they looked at the
tower’s door. They were curious about what the appearance of the
deified Undying Bird would be. The tower was not very large, so if
the Undying Bird did indeed live there, it couldn’t be too big
itself.</p>
<p>Everyone looked at the tower curiously, then they heard some
footsteps emerge. Not long later, they saw a shadow open the door
and walk out of the tower.</p>
<p>“She is the Undying Bird?” Han Sen’s eyes opened wide as he
watched the person walk out of the door. He thought it was
strange.</p>
<p>It was not an actual bird that was emerging; it was an old woman
with a cane. Her back was crooked. Her appearance was haggard, and
her skin was all wrinkled like the bark of an old tree. Due to the
fact she was crooked and old, her size only put her up to Han Sen’s
waist. She was wearing a pair of circular glasses and a red robe.
She certainly looked rather weird.</p>
<p>“Who is making a racket down there?” The old woman did not look
tall. She stood in front of the tower and looked down the mountain.
She couldn’t see very well, so she had to raise her glasses. Her
tired-looking eyes eventually settled on Bai Wei and the
others.</p>
<p>Bai Wei never expected someone like that would be the one to
emerge. She was a queen, and though she was surprised, she still
said, “I am Bai Wei, and I am King Bai’s daughter. I am here at the
request of my father. Are you the Undying Bird?”</p>
<p>The old woman pushed up her glasses. She stared at Bai Wei and
said slowly, “You are King Bai’s heir? I am not the Undying Bird. I
am merely an old woman that is tasked with cleaning the tower.”</p>
<p>“Then can you inform the Dying Bird that King Bai’s heir is
here?” Bai Wei said.</p>
<p>“You are too late, I am afraid. The Undying Bird is deceased,”
the old woman said slowly.</p>
<p>“Undying Bird died?” Han Sen’s eyes opened wide, and his
eyeballs almost popped out of their sockets.</p>
<p>Bai Wei was frozen, as she had not expected this to happen. If
the deified Undying Bird was dead, then there was no point in her
being there.</p>
<p>The old woman sighed and went on to say, “But Mister Undying
Bird told me that if King Bai’s heir does come, that person can
take whatever they please. That is, assuming they can triumph over
the test.”</p>
<p>Bai Wei’s face looked a little bit better, and so she went on to
ask, “I would like to try it. What is this test you are referring
to?”</p>
<p>The old woman did not answer. Her old eyes, which peered through
a pair of glasses, lingered on Han Sen. “Who are these people? They
do not look as if they belong to the Extreme King. If they do not
belong to the Extreme King, then just kill them. This is the
Undying Bird’s house, and not just anyone can make themselves
present.”</p>
<p>Han Sen felt a chill. That old woman looked very, very old, but
when she looked at them, Han Sen felt a great chill. He knew she
was actually a very dangerous being.</p>
<p>Bai Wei looked at Han Sen and answered the old woman. “They are
indeed knights of the Extreme King. They have helped escort me
here.”</p>
<p>“I see.” The old woman nodded and did not say anything. She held
her cane and slowly approached the edge of the mountaintop. She
looked so shaky as she went, and it made the onlookers worry about
whether or not she might misplace her step, slip, and fall off the
peak to her death.</p>
<p>Standing atop the peak and its stone steps, the old woman seemed
to be recalling something. She eventually said, “Back then, the
Undying Bird clashed with your father King Bai. Many people died,
but there was no winner. One thousand years later, they agreed to
have matters of battle put to their Marquise heirs. Their fights
would determine the ultimate victor. But Undying Bird could not
give birth to her heir. When she conceived a child, she died while
giving birth, so the fighting was unable to continue.”</p>
<p>After the woman said this, she looked very sad. She pointed to
the stone steps and said, “But the Undying Bird made these stairs
before she died. If you can walk past the stairs and come up to the
top, then you win, and then you can take the items that the Undying
Bird and King Bai fought for. If you cannot accomplish this, then
you can go home.”</p>
<p>“And there are no other conditions?” Bai Wei looked at the old
woman atop the peak.</p>
<p>“No. No matter how you do it, cross these steps and reach the
top. You’d still win even if you were to crawl up.” The old woman
coughed after speaking.</p>
<p>“If there are no other conditions, I’m going to start.” Bai Wei
said that, and then she walked up the stairs of the steam bun
mountain.</p>
<p>Han Sen looked at the stairs. They were only a few hundred
meters tall, and from the bottom to the top, it’d only be a few
thousand steps. Han Sen did not find anything strange about them,
but he wondered what sort of test the stairs would conduct. Han Sen
was even more interested in the item that the Undying Bird and King
Bai had fought for, but he also thought that the old woman was
extremely dangerous and that he would do well not to provoke her,
so he watched Bai Wei accept the test.</p>
