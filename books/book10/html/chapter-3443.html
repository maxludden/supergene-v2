<p>A shocking number of Break World beasts had come. They were like
dark clouds blanketing the sky, unceasing in their advance. Wang
Yuhang was riding his bike out of the bai sema. He was already in
his ultimate Super God Spirit mode. His entire body was so pretty
to look at. Wherever the bike was, a bloody cascade came falling as
the Break World beasts started to rip each other to shreds.</p>
<p>Tang Zhenliu was having fun watching. He laughed and said, “Good
job, Little Uncle. Is this all the God Chaos Party can throw at us?
What was the point of bringing in all of those Break World beasts?
With Little Uncle here, if a thousand come, a thousand will die. If
10,000 come, 10,000 will die.”</p>
<p>“Interesting. There is no 1,000 or 10,000. There is only me. How
are you guys going to kill me?” An evil and seductive voice rang
through space. There was a weird woman with two heads on the
approach. She stopped Wang Yuhang’s advance.</p>
<p>The Break World beasts that were killing each other under the
influence of Wang Yuhang’s power had their eyes turn red. Now, they
all jumped toward Wang Yuhang.</p>
<p>Wang Yuhang was shocked by the reversal of allegiance. He knew
he had encountered a mighty foe. He madly exploded his Super
Hormone, seeking to turn things around quickly.</p>
<p>The Break World beasts around were affected by Wang Yuhang and
the lady with two heads. Their eyes kept turning red, going crazy
non-stop. They would jump to Wang Yuhang, and then they would jump
to the two-headed woman.</p>
<p>The woman with two heads had a face that was very seductive and
another face that looked very cold, but they felt as if they had
magical powers. They were trying to fight back and gain control of
the Break World beasts to overthrow the grip Wang Yuhang had on the
creatures.</p>
<p>Some Break World beasts went crazy because of the constant
flipping of emotions. They went crazy so that they started ripping
up their own bodies. Their bodies became pieces and chunks. They
tore themselves up so much that their bones showed, yet they still
would not stop.</p>
<p>“It has been so long since I last encountered an opponent that
posed a challenge,” the pretty face said. “You should remember my
name, for my name is Shelley.” The body of the woman came for Wang
Yuhang.</p>
<p>Wang Yuhang and Shelley started to fight. They did not have the
time to notice other things. The Break World beasts around them
were still affected though. The other Break World beasts beyond
those, however, were headed for the bai sema around Space
Garden.</p>
<p>Huangfu Jing rushed out of the bai sema. She teleported in front
of a Break World beast. She used her long legs like a battleax to
cut the Break World beast in half.</p>
<p>The white tiger opened its eyes. Before Itchy could speak again,
it stood up. It looked at Huangfu Jing and moved its legs and
vanished. When it appeared again, it was directly in front of
Huangfu Jing.</p>
<p>Pang!</p>
<p>Huangfu Jing’s heart jumped. She lifted her arms. The moment she
moved, the white tiger showed up with its claws coming down against
Huangfu Jing. If she hadn’t been a second quicker, the claws would
have shredded her eyes.</p>
<p>The two powers attacked. Space around started to crack. Even the
bodies of the Break World beasts around were breaking.</p>
<p>The scary attacks had started, and Space Garden’s powerful
elites were already fighting. There were still many creatures in
Space Garden that were simply watching the battle unfold. That
included the Very High and Sky Palace students.</p>
<p>The Sky Palace students in particular were feeling awfully glum.
Space Garden had many elites fighting there, but in Sky Palace,
only Sky Palace Leader could participate in the combat.</p>
<p>“We of Sky Palace were once the best in the universe, but now we
must rely on the protection of others.” A Sky Palace elder let out
a sigh.</p>
<p>In fact, this was what most of the Sky Palace students were
thinking. They all felt very sad.</p>
<p>While they were feeling sad and complaining, two shadows from
the Sky Palace camp-a black and a white one-arose. They departed
the safety of the bai sema and plunged into the Break World beast
horde.</p>
<p>“It is Lone Bamboo and Yu Shanxin!” When the Sky Palace students
saw those two, they become incredibly happy. “Yes! We of Sky Palace
have Lone Bamboo and Yu Shanxin in our midst. They are no weaker
than the elites of Space Garden.” Seeing Lone Bamboo and Yu Shanxin
in the middle of all those beasts, they saw that one of them had a
very sharp sword light. The other wielded a very light jade finger.
They were no worse than the elites in Space Garden. People were
very happy about their presence there.</p>
<p>Ji Yanran was holding Ling’er, but she looked worried. Space
Garden had many elites, but God Chaos Party had many more Break
World beasts and elites. They watched the Break World beasts come
without reprieve. Many Break World beasts kept coming. They kept
trying to bring down the bai sema.</p>
<p>“Little Gold Gold, take care of my mother and my little sister.”
Littleflower spoke to Golden Growler, who was next to Ji Yanran. He
turned to Ji Yanran and said, “Mother, the situation is awfully
glum. I am going into battle.”</p>
<p>“Be careful. Fight what you can but run away if it becomes too
much. That is the Han family tradition. Do not bring us any
embarrassment.” Ji Yanran touched Littleflower on the head.</p>
<p>“Mother, do not worry. In this world, there are no other people
that can take our lives.” After saying that, Littleflower, broke
space and departed. His body glowed with white light. He looked
like another person. He did not look young. His white, long hair
was floating like a battle god was descending.</p>
<p>The moment he rushed out of the bai sema, Littleflower moved his
hand. Time and space started to change. The Break World beasts that
were going to Space Garden suddenly turned around. They struck the
other Break World beasts.</p>
<p>“I have heard that the holy body’s time and space power is
invincible. Today, I, Itchy, am going to learn of it.” Itchy
traveled through time and stopped Littleflower’s assault.</p>
<p>The space fight was not stopping. It made the universe collapse.
Stars were breaking. Aside from the bai sema that was protecting
Space Garden, space around was an utter mess. It was like the end
of the world.</p>
<p>In the evolution wall, Han Sen was suffering under the duress of
so much pressure. His body was not breaking, but his soul was not
something unbreakable. The spirits of many different races showed
up from all inches of the evolution wall. There had to be at least
30,000 of them.</p>
<p>Han Sen received pressure from 30,000 different powers. His will
was so tense that it was like steel. It looked as if he was going
to break at any second.</p>
<p>If this was another creature, their will would have been
crushed. They would be turned into an idiot. Right now, the whole
concept of Han Sen not yet going nuts was something of a
miracle.</p>
<p>Beneath that pressure, his body had yet to move. He still could
not trigger his body’s power to combine with his will and soul.</p>
<p>“Did Crape Myrtle want to turn me into an idiot?” Han Sen knew
that it would not be possible, but he still felt as if his will was
yearning to snap. He was not a god. He was just a human. Humans had
their limits. Han Sen felt as if his will was going to be pushed
too far beyond his limit.</p>
<p>Suddenly, the evolution wall displayed a new race. It lit up.
The name was brighter than the name of any other race. It was like
a bright moon amidst a sea of stars. It was so pure. “Fairy!”</p>
<p>When Han Sen saw the word, he was shocked.</p>
<p>Han Sen knew what the word meant, but there were two
possibilities. First, it was the jade spirit fairies that were made
from Chaos. The other had a chance of being scarier. That word
might have meant the God Chaos Party Leader. To be accurate, only
the God Chaos Party leader was a fairy. The jade holy fairies were
just some products Chaos had created.</p>
