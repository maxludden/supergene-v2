  Goddess was in the Martial Hall of Sacred shelter, watching the Divinity’s Bout A man covered in holy light walked onto the battlefield.

Almost everyone in the Fourth Sanctuary knew about Dollar now. However, as Goddess looked at Dollar, she felt that he seemed familiar. It wasn’t because she had seen his fights like everyone else; she felt that she had met Dollar before, but she couldn’t recall when or where.

It was natural that Goddess couldn’t recall. She couldn’t link this peerless being with someone who was defeated by her dog in a single strike.

And also, Goddess hadn’t given Han Sen a second look. Before she actually saw Han Sen clearly, her black dog had already smacked him into a wall. Goddess thought Han Sen had already died, which was why she could kind of remember his shape, but she couldn’t remember where she actually met him.

Sacred’s master entered the battlefield and summoned a golden scepter into his hands.

There was a pair of wings on his back, and he was wearing a beautiful armor. The golden scepter in his hands was gleaming, and he looked fabulous in the outfit. He really looked like some god from a religious legend.

Han Sen looked at the master of Sacred shelter, and he was considering how he could kill his well-dressed opponent without giving him a chance to concede the battle.

Everyone in Sacred shelter was a super creature, and Sacred’s master was a berserk super creature. Even if Han Sen’s super geno points were already maxed, he was still very interested in the beast soul and geno core of a berserk super creature.

Before Han Sen moved, Sacred’s master started to strike. He raised the scepter in his hand, and the golden crystal started to release a gleaming halo, covering the entire battlefield with golden light.

Han Sen was completely invincible under his super king spirit mode, so he wasn’t afraid of that golden light at all. However, when the golden light fell on Han Sen’s body, it felt strange. It was as if the golden light wasn’t giving out any forces, and it didn’t affect Han Sen’s body.

Although he couldn’t be sealed or dampened as a super king spirit, he would still feel something. Even if it wasn’t destructive, Han Sen would at least feel something.

However, Han Sen didn’t feel anything, which meant the golden light wasn’t trying to attack at all.

Han Sen couldn’t tell what the golden light was used for, but he didn’t have time to think about it Sacred’s master raised the scepter in his hands and rushed toward Han Sen.

Han Sen stood still, and when the scepter was about to hit his body, he raised Blow Blood to his mouth and blew it toward the master of Sacred shelter.

Peng!

Even a great being like Sacred’s master couldn’t handle the destructive power of Blow Blood. The bloody light went through the face of Sacred’s master, and his entire head exploded.

In the next second, the creature’s head recovered as if nothing had happened. The scepter moved toward Han Sen.

Han Sen frowned a bit, and he hit the scepter with his fist. The giant force from his fist bounced the scepter away, but it didn’t injure Sacred’s master.

Sacred’s master noticed that his own power hadn’t been reduced much, and he was exhilarated. He dashed toward Han Sen with the scepter in his hands again, with that terrifying golden light.

Han Sen defended himself against the crazy attacks from Sacred’s master while shooting streams of bloody light with Blow Blood. The bloody light hit Sacred’s master and exploded on his body again and again, but Sacred’s master seemed to be a true immortal, like some kind of god. No matter how injured he got, he could recover in less than a second.

It was recovering instead of healing. When his flesh and blood exploded, his body didn’t knit itself back together, it was just instantly restored to its previous state. Han Sen realized that Sacred’s master was recovering so quickly because that golden light was helping.

Inside the golden sacred light, the master of Sacred could endlessly store his body, and injuries meant nothing to him. They couldn’t even weaken his power.

“No wonder the golden light didn’t have any attacking power. He’s using the power on himself.” Han Sen was a bit surprised in his heart.

“Dollar isn’t that strong after all. He’s just a little bit stronger than Sacred’s master.”

“Dollar is indeed inferior to the Armored Man. The master of Outer Sky, who is just as powerful as Sacred’s master, was killed instantly by the Armored Man, yet Dollar can’t even break Sacred’s Golden Light.”

“If he loses this battle, he might not even get the second place of the Son of God’s.”

“No wonder Sacred’s master is a top-tier demigod. Dollar is still too young.”

“Dollar seems to be much weaker than I expected. He isn’t as tyrannical as that Armored Man at all.”

“I think Dollar just relied on his geno core. Without his geno core, he is just barely a top-tier being.”

“You can’t say that. Dollar hasn’t used his self geno core yet, so it’s difficult to say who will win and who will lose.”

“It doesn’t matter, really. Even if he wins, do you really think he is now qualified to fight the Armored Man for first place?”

“Fight for first place? The Armored Man will definitely be the first place, and Dollar is likely to be the second place.’

Sacred’s master was indeed a top-tier being, and he wasn’t at a disadvantage at all against Han Sen in super king spirit mode. Within his Golden Light, he was like an undying god, and the fight became quite heated.

Han Sen was quite interested in the Golden Light of Sacred’s master. He didn’t care what the onlookers were talking about. He put away the Blow Blood geno core and summoned the Six Paths Sword that Six Paths had left behind.

Though Han Sen couldn’t use the Six Paths Sword as well as Six Paths Emperor, Han Sen didn’t intend to practice the entirety of Six Paths’ sword technique. He only simulated the last technique, Six Paths as One.

Though it was only around sixty percent alike, the power was still terrific. The power in the sky and earth flooded toward the Six Paths Sword, and the power in the sword grew stronger and stronger.

Everyone was pretty surprised. Other people couldn’t tell Han Sen’s power, but they were all very surprised that Han Sen was able to perform the blade technique Six Paths as One.

It was conceptualized and created by Six Paths himself, and it couldn’t be used simply by wielding a Six Paths Sword. When Han Sen performed it, it looked very much like the real Six Paths, so everyone was amazed.

When the power in the swords condensed, Han Sen slashed toward the scepter instead toward Sacred’s master himself.

Sacred’s master was scared. He didn’t dare resist the Six Paths Sword directly, so he dodged it. Six Paths as One could be used several times, and that was what Han Sen did. Though the power wasn’t as strong as what Six Paths himself wielded, it was still incredible.

Sacred’s master didn’t dare to let the Six Paths Sword hit the crystal on his scepter, so he conceded and quit the battlefield.

Though Han Sen won the battle, many people lost confidence in him. Nobody thought that he could beat the Armored Man anymore.
