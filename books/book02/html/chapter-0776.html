    <p>
      &#8220;Lin Beifeng?&#8221; Han Sen turned around with surprise. It had
      been a while since he had last seen him, and he did not expect to see him
      here in the Second God&#8217;s Sanctuary.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;This is a fate-wrought meet, undoubtedly.&#8221; Lin Beifeng ran
      over to Han Sen, grabbed his hands, and almost began bawling his eyes out.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;I&#8217;ll confess it has been a while, but there is no need for
      such a display of passion.&#8221; Seeing Lin Beifeng so happy, Han Sen was
      quite touched.
    </p>

    <p>
      Lin Beifeng wiped his teary eyes and maintained a grip on Han Sen&#8217;s
      hands as he said, &#8220;Brother, I am touched. In this dusty craphole,
      even if my wallet were bursting at the seams, I cannot buy anything. It is
      a miserable and upsetting affair. Now that I have finally met you, I can
      spend my money on decent merchandise. Come; sell me two sacred-blood beast
      souls!&#8221; When Han Sen heard this, he threw his clingy hands away. The
      whole reason he was behaving so passionately was for this, it was now
      plain to see.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;You think sacred-blood beast souls are a common item you can buy
      from just anywhere? And you&#8217;re saying you want two?!&#8221; Han Sen
      laughed.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;I am not willing to believe you do not have any for sale.&#8221;
      Lin Beifeng was unaffected by Han Sen&#8217;s comments, and still insisted
      that he be sold some sacred-blood beast souls.
    </p>

    <p>
      Lin Beifeng had been bored out of his mind in this place for quite some
      time. He was very rich, but his family lacked ties to the greater
      families. In his time here, few people had been willing to help him, and
      even with the money he had, he couldn&#8217;t buy anything decent. His
      time here had not been pleasant.
    </p>

    <p>
      He never expected to see Han Sen here though, of all places. He had heard
      many tales regarding Han Sen&#8217;s escapades, and having known him
      previously, was certain he would have sacred-blood beast souls for sale.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Brother Beifeng, cease your acting. Do you really think this child
      would have sacred-blood beast souls available for sale? I have already
      given you my price. Either cough up the coin or get lost; don&#8217;t play
      games with me,&#8221; a middle-aged man near Lin Beifeng said.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;I&#8217;m not buying your rubbish beast souls. This guy has
      all-manner of different beast souls; so why would I buy ones from your
      crappy roster?&#8221; Lin Beifeng coldly replied.
    </p>

    <p>
      People knew Lin Beifeng was rich, so it was common for people to attempt
      to scam him. There weren&#8217;t many high-class beast souls in a place
      such as this, and such extortionists frequently grouped up to weasel the
      most coin out of him. They would sell him mutant beast souls for the price
      of a sacred-blood beast soul. Either Lin Beifeng bought them or had
      nothing to use. He was a daily victim of this treatment.
    </p>

    <p>
      Unfortunately for him, these same schemers owned the shelters, and the
      prices they presented were unchangeable. After all, the prices were their
      call to make. Lin Beifeng had no choice but to suffer and accept the
      exorbitant fees they charged.
    </p>

    <p>
      Now that he had met Han Sen, he wasn&#8217;t willing to be bullied
      anymore, and he most certainly wasn&#8217;t going to buy their beast
      souls.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Well, Brother Beifeng, I give you an ultimatum. You either buy it
      now off me for this price or don&#8217;t. But if you come around wanting
      to buy it again in the future, I can guarantee you the price won&#8217;t
      be this generous,&#8221; Liu Jie fearlessly said. He did not believe the
      pretty, young stranger possessed a single sacred-blood beast soul.
    </p>

    <p>
      Liu Jie knew all about this place and the surrounding area, and he knew
      that the shelter only had a dozen mutant beast souls available for sale.
      There weren&#8217;t any sacred-blood beast souls to be found in the
      markets, and there most certainly wouldn&#8217;t be any on a pretty, young
      man.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Whatever,&#8221; Lin Beifeng coldly said. Then he ignored the
      extortionist. Turning back to face Han Sen, he smiled and said,
      &#8220;Let&#8217;s go, brother. I am buying you food. And perhaps, just
      perhaps, we might talk a while, as we eat.&#8221;
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Forgive me for interrupting your plans for lunch, but don&#8217;t
      we have a spirit attacking the shelter right now? Shouldn&#8217;t we go
      take a look?&#8221; Han Sem said, smiling.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Sure, let&#8217;s go take a look at what we face.&#8221; Lin
      Beifeng felt a chill run down his spine. He knew that with Han Sen&#8217;s
      help, however, he&#8217;d be able to move to another royal shelter and not
      remain stuck where he currently he was.
    </p>

    <p>
      People in the shelter had mercilessly bullied him, extracting every penny
      they could through a barrage of tricks and scams. No one had been willing
      to help him move to another royal shelter. He couldn&#8217;t do it on his
      own, but right now, with Han Sen at his side, he knew he wouldn&#8217;t
      have to worry.
    </p>

    <p>
      They both ascended the city wall, and looking over, they witnessed a
      spirit commanding creatures to attack the shelter. After taking a look,
      Han Sen quickly lost interest.
    </p>

    <p>
      It was a royal spirit that looked like an ugly ogre. It was something Han
      Sen was not interested in killing or claiming the spirit stone for.
    </p>

    <p>
      The creatures that were attacking the shelter were mutant creatures, as
      well. Han Sen was too lazy to bother slaying such unthreatening creatures.
    </p>

    <p>
      But the people in the shelter quickly grew concerned and considered their
      would-be conquerors as a grave threat. Lin Beifeng was very tempted to
      help, so he asked Han Sen, &#8220;Brother, do you have any sacred-blood
      beast souls? If you lend me two, I will go down there and show them how
      it&#8217;s done.&#8221;
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen gave him two sacred-blood beast souls that he would never
      otherwise use, which made Lin Beifeng super happy. He was given a
      sacred-blood armor and the long-forgotten ghost-pawed claws. After suiting
      up, Lin Beifeng hastily ran out to greet the attackers who sought to claim
      the shelter.
    </p>

    <p>
      Through the aid of his new sacred-blood beast souls, although Lin Beifeng
      was not that strong, he could easily slay the ordinary creatures. Even the
      mutant variants could do nothing to him and were soon cut down.
    </p>

    <p>
      Lin Beifeng had become an extremely powerful man, as he was seen cleaving
      his way through the hordes of monsters down below. He even looked quite
      heroic, and this shocked the people of the shelter.
    </p>

    <p>
      By the time all was said and done, he managed to beat the ogre into
      running away. Once his victory was assured, everyone gave him massive
      applause.
    </p>

    <p>
      After beating the spirit, Lin Beifeng himself was exuberantly happy. When
      the deed was complete, he spared no time in bringing Han Sen to a hotel
      where they could eat.
    </p>

    <p>
      Not long after, a group of people arrived at the shelter. Liu Jie and the
      people in charge went to welcome the team.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Liu Jie, didn&#8217;t you send a message as a plight for aid,
      saying a royal spirit sought to conquer the shelter? What is this?&#8221;
      Liu Kuang asked, frowning.
    </p>

    <p>
      With him, he had brought a team of fairly skilled warriors. They were to
      support him in slaying the mutant horde, but now that they had arrived,
      they were surprised to see the fight already over.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Brother Kuang, a kid came out of nowhere and sold two sacred-blood
      beast souls to Lin Beifeng. His mood was cockier than usual today, and so
      he promptly went out to slay the creatures and send the ogre back off to
      its hole.&#8221; Liu Jie relayed to him what had transpired during his
      absence.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;What is this &#8216;kid&#8217;s&#8217; association with Lin
      Beifeng?&#8221; Liu Kuang frowned. He believed Lin Beifeng was a worthless
      piece of meat, who was easy to bully. And bully him they did, frequently,
      in this knight shelter. Now, someone had sold him two sacred-blood beast
      souls. This meant they could no longer scam money from his coffer.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;He said they were friends. He was about twenty years old at the
      most. He had silky skin, the sort which made him look quite weak and
      useless. I would say he was just like Lin Beifeng; a loser from a rich
      family. God knows where he managed to get two sacred-blood beast souls to
      sell to Lin Beifeng.&#8221; Liu Jie approached him closer and continued by
      saying, &#8220;Brother Kuang, should we take care of this kid?&#8221;
    </p>

    <p>
      Liu Kuang gestured with his hand and said, &#8220;Getting sacred-blood
      beast souls will not be easy. And if that kid is not from our shelter and
      has been able to come out all this way, he must be fairly
      experienced.&#8221;
    </p>

    <p>
      After a pause, he continued by saying, &#8220;Are you sure no one else
      followed this kid&#8217;s arrival?&#8221;
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Yeah. I have been sending people to keep an eye on them, and
      knowing about everyone else in this shelter, I can indeed confirm that
      there is no one else here aside from him,&#8221; Liu Jie quickly said.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Good.&#8221; Liu Kuang&#8217;s eyes were tinged with hate and
      cruelty. He went on to say, &#8220;Little Zhang, go and bring Brother
      Blind.&#8221;
