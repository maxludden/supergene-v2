“The eighteen-weapon strikes get stronger the closer to the end you are. The first hit is about the level of an ordinary Duke-level striking with full strength. I suppose that an ordinary Duke could break the lance with brute force. His fitness isn’t too bad, then.” The woman in the control room thought that she was being pretty generous when she defined Han Sen as “not bad.”

That level of fitness was common for the people of the Extreme King. Even Bai Wei, who had just become a Duke, could probably do the same thing with her Extreme King Punch. Han Sen’s attack wasn’t a very unusual thing for the woman to see.

That woman liked smart and brave men. She didn’t like reckless men, who fought with nothing more than muscle power.

The woman believed that power could be increased in a number of different ways. If the intelligence and emotions of a person were weak, however, it would be hard for them to ever become strong.

Han Sen’s punch broke a lance, and immediately after, another weapon was flying toward him. The attacks didn’t even give him a second to breathe.

His assailant was a knife this time, and when the knife came soaring towards Han Sen, it took the image of a tiger that was ready to devour the world. It roared as it came for Han Sen.

Pang!

Han Sen threw a punch, breaking the knife’s tiger strike. That strong collision of powers didn’t even leave a wound on Han Sen’s mighty fist. It still glistened like white jade.

The eighteen weapons attacked Han Sen, one after another. Each weapon had its own special power; the lance had been precise, while the knife was strong. Next came a sword that could cause intense pain. Every strike from each weapon was performed in a very skilled and efficient manner.

Normally, the princes and princesses could choose to fight on their own or let their guards fight on their behalf. Depending on the element of the incoming weapon, they could select the best fighter to deal with each individual threat.

But Han Sen didn’t care about efficiency. It didn’t matter if it was a sword or a lance or a stick coming for him; he demolished each one with a swing of his fist. By this point, eight weapons had been wrecked by his hands. And the whole time, Han Sen’s feet remained firmly planted in the same place he had started.

“His fitness isn’t bad. If he plans to use his body’s power to endure all eighteen hits, though, that will be a very naive thing to attempt. Even if Lone Bamboo was here, he wouldn’t be able to perform such a feat.” The woman looked shocked.

There were many who could break eight weapons, but Han Sen was acting as if nothing remotely remarkable had occurred. Not just any Duke could remain so calm under such circumstances. The eight punches so far could easily earn Han Sen recognition as one of the top Dukes.

It was frightening to think that a Duke who hadn’t awakened their astral body could reach this level.

Bai Wei stood behind Han Sen, and she looked a little bit confused. She understood that the eighteen weapons would become a lot stronger towards the end. She wasn’t confident she could complete the second set of nine attacks. She had wanted Han Sen to do the last nine, while she did the first nine.

But Han Sen had started fighting immediately. She was worried that Han Sen wouldn’t have enough strength to reach the end.

After all, Han Sen was just an original body Duke. He wasn’t like an astral body Duke that could utilize the powers of a planet. He wasn’t like a celestial body Duke, either, who could use the power of the universe to heal themselves.

Han Sen evidently planned to absorb all eighteen hits. Bai Wei didn’t think she could do something like that. If she had what it took, she wouldn’t have asked Han Sen for help.

Clearly, Bai Wei’s worries were unfounded. The eighteen weapons kept on attacking, but Han Sen was still as stable as a mountain. One hit, one weapon. He broke each and every attack.

Regardless of the power or craftiness of the weapons’ attacks, they could not escape Han Sen’s powerful punches.

A dozen weapons had been destroyed by Han Sen, and he was still behaving as if nothing out of the ordinary had happened. Bai Wei was staring at him in surprise, while the woman in the control room looked very strange.

*Boom!*

Han Sen punched the final weapon, and the woman in the control room looked stunned.

“No wonder he is considered to be on the same level as Lone Bamboo. He really does just depend on the power of the body. He is quite the character. But people like that can easily find themselves suppressed by higher level enemies. After all, he is quite reckless.” The woman then thought of something. She laughed and resumed talking to herself. “This is good! Someone with such simple power will be easy to control. He won’t be able to cause much trouble. He’ll be a decent Royal Guard after all. Bai Wei made a fine choice.”

After that, the woman stood up and walked out of the control room. Now that Bai Wei and Han Sen had entered The Grave of Soldiers and Kings, the camera would not be able to record them. There was no point in her hanging around.

When the space station’s captain saw the woman leaving, he wiped the cold sweat from his brow. “That was too scary. It is fortunate that Miss Mirror didn’t get angry.”

Being Bai King’s little sister, the woman was very famous. The last king had made her marry a deified elite of the Extreme King, but the man died in battle shortly after. She never sought to remarry, ever since.

Among the Extreme King, Miss Mirror was only spoken of in hushed tones. People didn’t fear her personal power; they feared her because she was in charge of King Bai’s secret organization called Spring Rain. She was King Bai’s most trusted confidante. Miss Mirror named her organization Spring Rain, but no one was ever really sure why.

Han Sen broke the eighteen weapons, and the grave beasts returned to looking like dead objects again. He and Bai Wei could now cross the plaza and enter the grave.

Bai Wei looked at Han Sen strangely. He was just a Duke, and yet he had managed to beat all eighteen weapon strikes by himself. Not many people in the Extreme King could do something like that, but Han Sen appeared to have done it rather easily. He was a far more powerful person than she initially believed him to be.

“How are we going to take the weapons?” Han Sen asked, while looking at the graves and gravestones.

Although he didn’t really care about the xenogeneic treasure, he wasn’t going to miss out on any freebies.

Bai Wei looked back, then glanced at the graves around them. She said, “The graves with a crown symbol carved into them are the graves belonging to one of the royal family. You cannot take the weapons buried in those. The weapons of any other grave can be taken, however. Just push the grave open and take the weapon inside.”

“Is it really that easy?” Han Sen asked, unconvinced.

Bai Wei shook her head. “It’s not that simple, you’re right. We don’t know who is buried in which grave. Because of that, we don’t know which graves contain good weapons. Once you have pushed the grave open, it doesn’t matter if the weapon inside is good or bad; you still have to take it. No swapping, either. You only have one chance. It is a shame I don’t have someone like Mister White. He could definitely calculate which grave has a deified weapon. In that case, I could base my choice on something more than dumb luck.”

After pausing, Bai Wei resumed speaking. “Luckily, we have come here mainly to gain access to the King’s Garden. I would be thrilled to get a high-class treasure, but it is fine if that is not what I receive.”

“Since we are here, I am going to get one no matter what.” Han Sen laughed as he looked across the graves.

Han Sen wasn’t a fan of luck. His Xuan Men wasn’t perfect, and nowhere near Mister White’s level, so he used his Dongxuan Aura and Purple-Eye Butterfly to examine the graves.
