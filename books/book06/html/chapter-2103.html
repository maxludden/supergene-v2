<p>“The Pool of Rebirth doesn’t just reset your body. The powers of
rebirth have a unique way of speeding up your leveling. The leader
must think your geno art is ascending too slowly, since you are
still only a Marquise. Hence, he has presented you with this
opportunity to make use of Holy Heaven’s Pool of Rebirth. Our
contract with the Feathers allows us to send three people of our
choosing to use the Pool of Rebirth every ten years. You are one of
those selected. The leader takes you as someone quite important,”
Thousand Feather Crane said, his voice filled with admiration.</p>
<p>“In that case, I will go to Holy Heaven.” Upon hearing that the
trip would benefit him, Han Sen did not hesitate. He agreed to
become an envoy and travel to Holy Heaven.</p>
<p>Given the precarious situation that the Feathers had found
themselves in, they could not risk offending Sky Palace and
bringing harm to Han Sen, either. The worse they could do was
mocking him.</p>
<p>Since he was gaining access to a valuable resource, though, Han
Sen was willing to turn a blind eye to their bad behavior.</p>
<p>“When you return from the Feather, it will be time for the Geno
Being Scroll to appear. Will you be entering that competition? You
could be the first Earl, easy.” After the question, Thousand
Feather Crane smiled.</p>
<p>Han Sen had two geno arts that were Marquise already, and
winning the competition would put him atop the list of all
Marquises in the universe. It would also highlight the fact he had
more than one geno art.</p>
<p>“I am not interested in boosting my reputation.” Han Sen shook
his head.</p>
<p>Han Sen wasn’t the only person going to Holy Heaven as an envoy.
A few others, including an elder, were going with him. The others
would hold meetings with the Feathers to discuss prolonged
co-operation between the two races. Han Sen had no objective beyond
making use of the pool.</p>
<p>Han Sen followed the group to Holy Heaven. The leader was the
tenth elder, Yun Changkong. Han Sen felt safe in his company; he
had a good relationship with the man’s daughters and students. If
something was to happen, he was certain Yun Changkong would protect
him.</p>
<p>The people of Sky Palace treated Han Sen nicely, in part due to
his great reputation there. He had done many great deeds in service
of Sky Palace, so they all liked him. Many gushed compliments.</p>
<p>They arrived in Feather territory safely. Before they went to
Holy Heaven, though, a King of the Feathers welcomed them.</p>
<p>At this point, the Feathers depended on their relationship with
Sky Palace for survival. Sky Palace’s protection was the only thing
keeping the other high races from attacking them, so they took
their commitment to Sky Palace seriously.</p>
<p>When the Feather King looked at Han Sen, however, his expression
was filled with distaste. Han Sen couldn’t tell if it was due to
the events with Kong Fei or the Blood Feather Knife. When Han Sen
entered Holy Heaven, all the Feathers treated him strangely, as
well. They were friendly with the other envoys, but they looked at
Han Sen with distaste.</p>
<p>Han Sen pretended it was nothing.</p>
<p>When the Feathers learned Han Sen was going to make use of the
Pool of Rebirth, though, they went from being annoyed to being
terribly upset.</p>
<p>After Ring Feather King showed them the pool, he said, “The Pool
of Rebirth it shut down for maintenance, so you’ll have to wait a
few days to use it. It will be available to you as soon as it opens
again.”</p>
<p>Han Sen resigned himself to staying in Holy Heaven for a while.
Luckily, he was an envoy, so nothing awry transpired.</p>
<p>In a meeting room in Holy Heaven, many Feather alphas and high
level Feathers were talking.</p>
<p>“The Pool of Rebirth is the holiest relic of the Feathers. How
can we allow it to be defiled by Han Sen?” a Feather elder
growled.</p>
<p>“Yeah! That animal is connected to Kong Fei. He cannot be
allowed to use it!” another Feather elder agreed angrily.</p>
<p>None of the Feather leadership were happy about the prospect of
Han Sen making use of their Pool of Rebirth.</p>
<p>“It’s not like we have a choice, though. This is the deal we
made with Sky Palace. Using the pool is perfectly within Han Sen’s
rights. And there is nothing we can do to stop that,” Holy Feather
King said.</p>
<p>Everyone was silent. When the Feather lantern darkened, all the
Feathers dropped a level. Holy Feather King had made use of
resources to re-secure his rank as a King. It had cost everything
Holy Heaven had in its reserves.</p>
<p>But they only recovered thirty to forty percent of their
original power. Without the protection of Sky Palace, Holy Heaven
would have ceased to be.</p>
<p>“If we cannot stop Han Sen from going in, we might as well just
totally open it for him,” an elder said.</p>
<p>“Fairy Feather elder, what do you mean?” Everyone looked at the
elder in confusion.</p>
<p>“Three people are allowed access to the rebirth pool at one
time. We have given Sky Palace three slots every ten years. They
are only making use of one slot, and that slot is given to Han Sen.
That means we can send two Feathers alongside him,” Fairy Feather
elder said.</p>
<p>Everyone looked at him with confusion, but he went on to say,
“The Pool of Rebirth’s power is limited. That is why only three can
go at a time. And those three have to be Marquise or lower. If a
King entered, the power of the pool would only be enough for that
one King. And he wouldn’t be able to be reborn. If Dukes wanted to
enter, only two Dukes could be reborn at a time.”</p>
<p>“You mean, we should send two Dukes into the pool with Han Sen?
So that they could steal whatever power he’d otherwise gain?” Holy
Feather King asked, while looking straight at Fairy Feather
elder.</p>
<p>Fairy Feather elder said, “We have all used the Pool of Rebirth,
so we can cope with its powers more than outsiders can. With two
Dukes that are stronger than Han Sen, they can surely absorb most
of its power. Han Sen will earn a little, but Sky Palace won’t
notice the trick.”</p>
<p>“This might work, but who is going to take this power?” The
elders began to discuss.</p>
<p>If a Duke class person absorbed too much power, they would end
up like Angia and become primal. They wouldn’t even be a Baron, and
they’d have to start from scratch again.</p>
<p>Not many people wished to end up like Angia, so very few Dukes
would want to take part in that.</p>
<p>Fairy Feather elder smiled. “Why don’t we let the two brothers
Angela and Andola use it?”</p>
<p>“Aren’t they locked-up in prison? Will they agree?” an elder
asked in shock.</p>
<p>“I can persuade them,” Fairy Feather said with a look of
confidence.</p>
<p>“If they can go, that really would be best. Not even ten Han
Sen’s could fight the two of them,” the elder stated, almost as if
he admired them.</p>
<p>On Han Sen’s fourth day there, they received news from the
Feathers proclaiming that the Pool of Rebirth was open again. It
was being prepared for use.</p>
