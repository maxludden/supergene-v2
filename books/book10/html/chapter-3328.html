<p>The black jade little beast’s body slowly moved. It looked
stiff. It was like a rusted robot.</p>
<p>Every time it moved, some cracks formed on the jade-stone shell.
The cracks were getting bigger and bigger. Huge chunks of it fell
off. There was wet, black hair underneath the black jade shell.</p>
<p>White King and the blue-clothed fairy’s eyes were riddled with
nothing short of utter confusion. If Han Sen had just enabled the
black jade little beast to wake up, it would have completely
shocked them.</p>
<p>The reason they were confused, however, was because the black
jade little beast was not solely awoken anymore.</p>
<p>If it was awake, the jade statue would have had a spirit. This
jade statue was just a jade statue. Its bodies were not truly
living. There was no lifecycle inside it like a real creature.</p>
<p>To put things more directly, the jade fairies in the Black King
City were just puppets of Black King. When Black King was there,
they could be given some sort of will. With Black King gone, they
were just a collection of jade stone statues.</p>
<p>Now, the black jade little beast had shed its jade-stone shell.
It had real blood and flesh, but it was not as simple as being
awake.</p>
<p>“Roar!” A roaring sound shook the whole of the black jade city.
The black jade little beast stood up and roared to the sky. The
rest of the black jade flew everywhere, revealing the entirety of
its body.</p>
<p>“It is alive?” The blue-clothed fairy looked shocked. Even
millions of years ago, she had never seen something quite this
shocking.</p>
<p>Back then, when the fairy went to the White Jade Jing and turned
the White Jade Jing into a place composed of 12 buildings and five
cities, everything there came from that fairy.</p>
<p>The pavilion, buildings, old towers, jade cities, one grass, one
wood, one beast, one bird, one bug, and one fish were all made by
the fairy jade statue.</p>
<p>Because the White Jade Jing carvings almost used all of the
fairy’s power, in the end, the fairy was only able to create the
most sacred 12 buildings, five cities, and 17 jade statues with a
life and soul.</p>
<p>Although those other jade statues came from the hands of that
fairy, they could only rely on Black King and the 17 jade statues’
power. They were not real-life forces.</p>
<p>Now, the little black beast had developed a real life pulse. Its
power was like the fairy that had created the White Jade Jing in
the first place. How could the blue-clothed fairy and White King
not end up shocked?</p>
<p>The little black beast had a real body. It shook its body and
looked around. It looked at Han Sen and jumped toward him.</p>
<p>Han Sen was trapped by the trap fairy net. He was unable to
avoid the little black beast, so it came right on him.</p>
<p>The little black beast did not seek to hurt Han Sen. It put its
tongue out and licked Han Sen’s face. It looked very intimate. It
was as if Han Sen was a member of its family.</p>
<p>“Stop licking!” Han Sen’s hands could not move. His inability to
move enabled the little black beast to keep licking him. There was
nothing he could do to stop it.</p>
<p>It took a while for the little black beast to calm down and stop
licking. Han Sen asked, “How was that? Do you guys believe me
now?”</p>
<p>“Bottle Fairy, let him go,” White King said.</p>
<p>The blue-clothed fairy looked shocked for a long time. When she
heard White King, she made sure to react. She calmed herself down
and put away the fairy net.</p>
<p>Han Sen stood up and stretched. The little black beast saw Han
Sen stand up and thought he was going to play with it. So, it
jumped at Han Sen.</p>
<p>Han Sen touched its head. That little guy’s hands and legs were
short. Its nails were very sharp. They were like wheels. They were
unable to touch Han Sen’s body.</p>
<p>“Little Guy, you go and play over there,” Han Sen said to the
little black beast. It seemed to understand Han Sen and crawled to
the side. It kept crawling away while looking back at Han Sen. It
looked as if it did not want to leave.</p>
<p>“What is your name?” White King did not have any emotions, but
his words were obviously infused with a penchant for more
niceties.</p>
<p>“My name is Han Sen,” Han Sen answered.</p>
<p>White King nodded, looked at Han Sen, and said, “If you are able
to give a body to the jade fairies in the White Jade Jing, the
crime of you killing Black King can be erased. Furthermore, you
will be considered a friend of the White Jade Jing.”</p>
<p>“I wonder what the benefits of being White Jade Jing’s friend
are.” Han Sen could tell White King and the blue-clothed fairy
White King had referred to as Bottle Fairy was shocked about the
little black beast being revived.</p>
<p>White King had also only mentioned the jade fairies of White
Jade Jing and not Black King City. This was interesting.</p>
<p>White King said, “If you need help, for as long as you do not go
against the laws of the White Jade Jing’s fairy laws, I will give
my life to fight for you.”</p>
<p>“That does not seem like a bad deal, but how do I know you will
keep your promise?” Han Sen asked. “To revive the jade statue is
something that requires a lot of power. Getting all of the lives
here to be made flesh will not be an easy task. I am afraid I will
need eight or 10 years to do that.”</p>
<p>“Let us not talk about eight or 10 years. Even if it takes a
hundred years or a thousand years, I will be able to wait for that.
If you are willing to do this, we can wait a thousand years.” White
King paused a moment and said, “Regarding your worries, it is
pointless. We follow the rules of the fairies. We are under the
rule of the fairies. If we make a vow, we are compelled to complete
it. Otherwise, the White Jade Jing’s holy laws would punish us.
Even I would be subject to it.”</p>
<p>Han Sen thought White King was being very serious. It did not
seem as if he was speaking randomly, so he asked, “What are the
fairy laws?”</p>
<p>“Please come here,” White King said. Then, he walked to Black
King City.</p>
<p>Han Sen did not hesitate. He followed after him while Bottle
Fairy came along from behind. She looked at Han Sen with a
complicated expression.</p>
<p>There were 12 buildings and five cities. It was something Han
Sen had already seen. Now, the 12 buildings and five cities were
bigger. There was not much of a difference aside from that.</p>
<p>White King did not bring Han Sen to peruse the 12 towers and
five cities. After going by the five cities, they went to the
highest peak of the White Jade Jing. There was a white jade tablet
there.</p>
<p>The white jade tablet had many laws. Han Sen had a look at them.
Many of the laws were weird, but they were all quite serious. One
of the fairy laws stated that if a fairy made a promise, they could
not break it, or the White Jade Jing would take away their fairy
bodies.</p>
<p>There were too many laws. Han Sen could not be bothered reading
much more. He looked around. On the left bottom corner of the white
jade tablet, he saw a symbol.</p>
<p>The white jade tablet had many words. There was only one
illustration, and it was the symbol in that corner. It was the
symbol of a gourd.</p>
<p>Han Sen thought that gourd was very familiar. It was like the
gourd he had before Bao’er was born. The size and shape were
similar.</p>
