    <p>&#8220;Today, I saw a lot.&#8221;</p>

    <p>
      &#8220;He is too strong. That elite had unlocked his first gene lock, but
      Han Sen whipped him like a dog.&#8221;
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;It&#8217;s sick. That guy&#8217;s little pet dog absolutely ravaged
      the elite who had managed to unlock his first gene lock. If that was his
      pet, how strong must he himself be?&#8221;
    </p>

    <p>&#8220;What pet dog? It was a pet cat.&#8221;</p>

    <p>
      &#8220;It was stronger than a dog, no matter what it was. It possessed the
      strength of a god! Han Sen didn&#8217;t even have to do anything. All he
      did was talk until he decided to sick the fiend on Thunderdevil.&#8221;
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;This is madness. You guys weren&#8217;t there. None of you saw the
      look on Qi Xiuwen and his followers' faces. There were a few hundred
      evolvers there, forty of them with a fitness level of more than one
      hundred. All of them possessed a fair amount of might, but in front of Han
      Sen, none of them even dared to pass wind. They were afraid of doing
      anything that might tick Han Sen off, perhaps inciting him to slay them
      all in one fell swoop. Qi Xiuwen was so frightened, he almost had a heart
      attack and died.&#8221;
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;If you ever have a role model, whose footsteps you would be keen to
      follow in, make it Han Sen. That way, you will achieve true
      happiness.&#8221;
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Be Han Sen? You wouldn&#8217;t even qualify to be his pet!&#8221;
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Pet? You guys think you can match that pet of his? That pet killed
      the fellow with an unlocked gene lock. Han Sen could put you to work as a
      dishcloth, but beyond that, I doubt he&#8217;d find any use for you
      guys.&#8221;
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Well, one thing has become a certainty; the Icefield are now the
      domain of Han Sen.&#8221;
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Of course, he is unique. I bet you&#8217;d never find anyone else
      remotely like him elsewhere. And I&#8217;m not talking about just the
      Icefield. This guy would most likely be the cream of the crop no matter
      which shelter he went to.&#8221;
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;I&#8217;ve seen a lot in my time; but rarely have I been this
      excited. You didn&#8217;t get to see the way those high-and-mighty elites
      looked that day. When they saw what Han Sen did, they were like children
      approaching an abusive father.&#8221;
    </p>

    <p>…</p>

    <p>
      After the fighting that took place in the royal shelter, the Icefield
      changed. The three factions that governed the Icefield were broken. Han
      Sen took the royal shelter and formed an alliance with Li Xinglun and
      Philip, which led to the formation of a new Goddess Shelter. The three
      armies were then split into four.
    </p>

    <p>
      Yang Manli was made leader of the Goddess Army, Li Xinglun was put in
      charge of the Starwheel Army, Philip became the leader of the Philip Army,
      and lastly, Qiu Xiuwen was made leader of the Blackgod Army.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen remained leader of the Goddess Shelter, but was unsatisfied with
      the title. He thought &#8220;leader&#8221; lacked a certain flair.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen did not kill Qi Xiuwen, though, because that would only cause more
      problems in the future. He also needed the strength of Qi Xiuwen&#8217;s
      men to keep the new royal shelter in fine operation.
    </p>

    <p>Han Sen did not fear the possibility being betrayed again, either.</p>

    <p>
      The three factions worked together to bring down the royal shelter, with
      the Blackgod Shelter receiving the most benefits. But because of the
      treachery enacted by Qi Xiuwen and his men, all their potential rewards
      were forfeited and given to Han Sen exclusively.
    </p>

    <p>
      Qi Xiuwen did not receive a penny or a scrap of meat. Despite all of his
      rewards being taken by Han Sen, however, he did not complain once. He was
      merely happy enough to be walking away with his head still attached to his
      shoulders. Han Sen was no longer a man he would be keen to trifle with.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen also gave the Goddess Army the greatest boons. If they required
      it, they could buy creature meat at very low prices. This meant the power
      of the troops in his army could increase at a much faster rate. Not only
      that, but following the news of his triumph over Qi Xiuwen&#8217;s
      treachery, many more people came to enlist in the Goddess Army. It
      didn&#8217;t take long before the ranks of Han Sen&#8217;s own army
      increased substantially. Although the army&#8217;s power was trailing
      behind the other three, at its new trajectory, it would soon surpass them.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Eat. Eat until your bellies are full! There is no need to save me
      some.&#8221; Han Sen prepared a truck-sized feast of sacred-blood meat for
      the angels to dine on.
    </p>

    <p>
      This time, Han Sen had received the bodies of four different sacred-blood
      creatures. They were killed by Qi Xiuwen and Thunderdevil, but it was Han
      Sen who became the recipient of their meat.
    </p>

    <p>
      Unfortunately, however, they were too big. Han Sen roasted a good deal of
      the meat and took to eating it with Zero. The rest was given to the
      angels, to accelerate their growth.
    </p>

    <p>
      Due to the silver fox&#8217;s tremendous performance, Han Sen started
      looking forward to seeing how the angels would develop as fighters.
    </p>

    <p>
      Aside from the sacred-blood meat they were given, there were over one
      hundred mutant beasts to eat, as well. Not to mention the countless
      ordinary monsters they had also become recipients of.
    </p>

    <p>
      It would have been impossible for Han Sen to eat them all in any
      reasonable amount of time, so he had no choice but to sell them. After
      all, the carcasses of once-living creatures could not be kept for long.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen did keep some smaller amounts of mutant creature flesh to eat. And
      with it, he estimated that within a month, his mutant geno points would be
      maxed out.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;It&#8217;s a shame I am unable to bring the silver fox out to hunt;
      otherwise, I would not have to worry about my sacred geno points,
      either.&#8221; Han Sen stroked the silver fox that continued to rest in
      his arms and couldn&#8217;t help but feel disappointed.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Boss, I have formulated the account!&#8221; Yang Manli had prepared
      a ledger for Han Sen, but when she came near to deliver it, her eyes could
      not look away from the silver fox.
    </p>

    <p>
      The silver fox had earned quite the name for itself across the Icefield.
      It was the pet that had killed an elite who had unlocked his gene lock in
      a single hit, after all. It was difficult to imagine something so small
      dealing such vast amounts of damage.
    </p>

    <p>
      Yang Manli had seen the silver fox before, but she believed it to be an
      ordinary pet. It only seemed natural, as Han Sen played with it
      frequently. She never imagined it had such terrifying powers. It was a
      frightening little thing.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen took a look at the ledger and was startled to learn that the sum
      of money they had received from selling the excess meat in the past few
      days was in the billions. If they started running the royal shelter, the
      income they would receive would be unimaginable. They&#8217;d end up
      rivalling the income generated from mega corporations that ran entire
      planets.
    </p>

    <p>
      Of course, it couldn&#8217;t possibly rival a galactic mega corporation,
      but Han Sen was happy to settle for his current projections. With this
      royal shelter, even if Han Sen didn&#8217;t lift a finger from this point
      on, he would be able to live a life of absolute luxury.
    </p>

    <p>
      But this was meaningless to Han Sen, because wealth was not his purpose.
      Money was useless to him, if he couldn&#8217;t achieve the power he was
      striving for.
    </p>

    <p>
      After Yang Manli left, Han Sen lifted the bottle of Geno Creation pills he
      had held onto. The last time he brought it out, the silver fox had shown
      great interest in eating them.
    </p>

    <p>
      But Han Sen didn&#8217;t let him, as he worried various problems might
      arise. He wasn&#8217;t sure if mutating genes was a bad thing or not, and
      it was different than the consumption of mutant flesh.
    </p>

    <p>
      The silver fox reached out its paws and tried to grab ahold of the bottle.
      It seemed as if it greatly desired to eat them.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen hesitated for a good while, but in the end, he opened the lid and
      pulled one out. He placed it in the palm of his hand and folded his
      fingers into a fist, to prevent the silver fox from taking it, as it
      desperately wanted to.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Are you sure you won&#8217;t have any problems eating this?&#8221;
      Han Sen wasn&#8217;t sure if the silver fox could understand him, but he
      still asked.
    </p>

    <p>
      The silver fox quickly nodded, as if it was a genuine response to the
      question. Then, it moved to rub its head on Han Sen&#8217;s closed fist.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen paused to think for some time, but then opened his hand. Quickly,
      the silver fox gobbled up the pill.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen observed the silver fox intently, anxiously waiting to see if
      there were any changes. He had obtained a fair amount of geno stabilizers
      from Qi Xiuwen, so if a problem arose, he was confident in his ability to
      fix it.
    </p>

    <p>
      After a while, the only change he noticed was the silver fox&#8217;s hair.
      Somehow, it looked a little brighter. But aside from that, nothing.
    </p>

    <p>
      The silver fox tried to claw at the empty bottle, as if he was still
      hungry for them.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;It looks like the Geno Creation pills are not strong enough to
      mutate a super creature,&#8221; Han Sen thought to himself.
