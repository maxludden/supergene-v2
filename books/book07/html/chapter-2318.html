<h2>Waking Up Shocked</h2>
<h3>Chapter 2318</h3>

<p>Han Sen knew that he had shot himself in the foot. That King
guard was aligned with the element of water, but that didn’t imply
affiliation with cold and yin force powers.</p>
<p>The fire element was known to restrict the water element, but
under the right conditions, they could actually make each other
more dangerous.</p>
<p>Like a steam machine: with the aid of fire, water could be
turned into high-pressure steam. Then it could apply a force of
pressure. The guard attacking Han Sen obviously had that skill and
power. The lava sea’s temperature increased the power of the water
AoE, making Han Sen’s situation all the direr.</p>
<p>The water around Han Sen heated up and turned into high-pressure
steam, restricting Han Sen’s body all the more. And the heat was
growing unbearable. It was like he had been thrown into a super
high-pressure cauldron.</p>
<p>If Han Sen hadn’t been running his powerful Jadeskin geno art,
he would have been easily cooked by the King’s area-of-effect.</p>
<p>“These Kings are getting harder and harder to deal with,” Han
Sen whined in his heart, but he remained focused on the fight,
using whatever powers he had at his disposal.</p>
<p>The fire crow beast soul from the systems of chaos made a fire
halo AoE that would give Han Sen fire powers. It also increased his
resistance to the fire element.</p>
<p>It was exactly the effect that Han Sen wanted, but regrettably,
the beast soul was only Marquise class. The effect wasn’t very
pronounced, but it made him feel a little bit better.</p>
<p>He summoned the Metal Doll beast soul next. Although he didn’t
know what it was for, he was too desperate to worry about it. If it
might help, it was being spawned.</p>
<p>Han Sen had given the Demon Bug King Bai Semas to Han Yan and
the others, in case they got into trouble. The bird’s nest had been
absorbed by the little red bird. Right now, Han Sen had no better
defensive alternatives.</p>
<p>The Metal Doll was deployed, and a black halo that resembled
teeth marks appeared around Han Sen’s feet. When the wheel-like
halo spun, Han Sen’s body was covered in black metal.</p>
<p>Han Sen felt as if his power had been given a boost, and his
power element was now indestructible. There was a certain sharpness
to all of his movements. When he swung his weapon, the steam
binding him became much easier to tear through.</p>
<p>“Does the Metal Doll halo increase the power and sharpness of
the user?” Han Sen didn’t have the time to think it through. He
gritted his teeth and dove deep into the lava sea.</p>
<p>Han Sen had no way to return to the surface. He planned to head
for the island that resided below the lava and see if he could find
the group of rock dragons and that blue metal wolf. If he could
manipulate them into entering the fight, he might have a chance of
fighting back.</p>
<p>Han Sen waved his Thunder God Spike to leave a wake of lightning
behind him, but the lightning was useless inside that
area-of-effect. The King class guard used his power to destroy the
attack. It achieved naught.</p>
<p>Pang! A blow landed on Han Sen’s body. Although the damage
wasn’t critical, streams of water were now flowing into his body
and thumping in his vessels.</p>
<p>Han Sen cast Spell’s Eternity solidifying power. His blood
solidified around the water in his body, prohibiting that power
from spreading through his body.</p>
<p>Han Sen incurred a few similar wounds, but they didn’t strike
any vital places. The King class guard was shocked. Although he
hadn’t yet landed a killing blow on Han Sen, he had been making use
of a toxic geno art. Anyone who was struck by it would be lucky if
they were only paralyzed. The poison could be deadly to King class
opponents, yet a mere Duke was repelling it.</p>
<p>And Han Sen was still able to fight him. He didn’t look to be
affected by the toxins, and that confused the guard.</p>
<p>Han Sen frowned. He was so close to the island now, but he
didn’t see any rock dragons.</p>
<p>As he was thinking, a sense of lightness passed over Han Sen’s
body. He dropped out of the lava, entering that familiar space
below. The King class guard entered right behind him. He saw the
lava sky above and the island down below. He was shocked at the
sight, and he murmured, “What? The center of Planet King Kong has a
place like this?”</p>
<p>Han Sen looked over the lake. He couldn’t see the blue metal
wolf that was taking a bath anymore, either. And not a single rock
dragon circled overhead. He felt sick, and he thought to himself,
“Why am I so unlucky? None of them are here.”</p>
<p>Han Sen teleported again, drawing closer to the lake. He waved
his Thunder God Spike to deflect the King class guard’s attack and
used his Dongxuan Aura to scan around like mad.</p>
<p>Suddenly, Han Sen noticed something blue below the surface of
the lake. A relieved smile spread over his face.</p>
<p>The blue metal wolf was merely sleeping underwater.</p>
<p>Without hesitation, Han Sen let himself get hit by one of the
guard’s strikes. The blow sent him shooting down into the water
like an arrow, and he swam straight to the blue metal wolf.</p>
<p>The King guard followed. Because Planet King Kong had no deified
xenogeneics, he didn’t think he had anything to be afraid of.</p>
<p>But when he entered the water, he woke up the sleeping blue
metal wolf.</p>
<p>When Han Sen entered the water, he was careful to hide his
presence. He slipped lightly under the surface, like a gracefully
diving acrobat. Han Sen even tried to suppress the splash to avoid
creating a startling movement.</p>
<p>But the King class guard didn’t care. He brought his AoE with
him, blanketing half of the lake. The attack also fell over the
blue metal wolf.</p>
<p>The sleeping wolf woke up in a fury. It stood up, its metallic
fur standing on end. Then it howled.</p>
<p>The lake exploded like a freshwater spring as the howl blasted
away the water. Han Sen curled up in fetal position, holding his
weapon in front to protect himself. Even so, the shockwave was
strong enough to blast him away with the rest of the lake
water.</p>
<p>Luckily, he was still wearing his Galactic Lobster Armor. It was
a King class set of armor. If he hadn’t been wearing it, the power
unleashed by the blue metal wolf would have shattered every bone in
his body.</p>
<p>“What amazing power! What is the level of this blue metal wolf?”
Han Sen wondered.</p>
<p>On the other side, the King guard now looked horrified. He was
frozen in the air, unmoving. The blue metal wolf was now standing
in the dry lakebed, and its blue wolf eyes were peering right at
him. The guard felt like he was being watched by the Grim Reaper
himself, and his nerves were as tight as bowstrings. His body was
shivering, and the only thing he wanted was to escape.</p>
<p>But he didn’t dare try. He was sure that, if he turned around,
the blue metal wolf would leap after him. The beast would chew him
up and crunch his bones.</p>
<p>The lake water rained down softly. The man and the wolf looked
at each other, and the King class guard’s forehead was covered in
sweat.</p>
