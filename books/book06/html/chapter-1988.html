<p>Yun Suyi saw Han Sen stand up, then teleport behind the Blood God Mantis. The purple knifelight slashed, and the Blood God Mantis’ triangle head looked as if it had been chomped on by a demon. The knifelight cut through it, and the body fell from the sky.</p>

<p>The blood reaper instantly shattered and disappeared into thin air.</p>

<p>“Xenogeneic Earl mutant hunted. Blood God Mantis: xenogeneic gene found.”</p>

<p>“I didn’t get its beast soul?” Han Sen’s thoughts were painted with greed.</p>

<p>Yun Suyi looked at Han Sen strangely. He had one-hit-killed an Earl mutant xenogeneic. That was a far stronger feat than Thousand Feather Crane could accomplish.</p>

<p>But seeing Han Sen’s strength, Yun Suyi felt even worse. She thought to herself, “Why is he taken?”</p>

<p>Han Sen dug the mutant gene out of the Blood God Mantis. It was a piece of its shell. There were still some wisps of smoke rising from the bloody piece of crystal. You could tell that it was the face of the red reaper.</p>

<p>“Earl genes insufficient. Cannot refine mutant gene.”</p>

<p>Han Sen was shocked when hearing this. It was an Earl mutant gene. He had been able to refine the ant queen’s gene when his total tally was a few points less. Now, he had two more genes than before, and yet he couldn’t refine the Blood God Mantis’ gene. He pondered how the requirements for Earl genes were determined.</p>

<p>Han Sen put away Blood God Mantis’ mutant gene and passed the body to his legless crane. Bringing Yun Suyi along with him, Han Sen proceeded to hunt xenogeneics on Old Night Island. He was only planning on going back when White Jade Jing opened again. After that, the exam was set to start.</p>

<p>Inside Buddha Kingdom, Clear Sea King bowed before Burning Lamp Alpha. “Alpha, Han Sen broke the ant’s body curse. He is now practicing in Sky Palace.”</p>

<p>Burning Lamp Alpha said casually, “Knife Queen must have asked the leader of Sky Palace to break my looping skill.” “We’re going to let him get off scot-free?” Clear Sea King asked, looking crushed.</p>

<p>“The Buddha cannot engage in acts that disrupt Sky Palace, for the time being. If he is in Sky Palace, we will have to ignore him.” Burning Lamp Alpha looked like he knew this was going to happen, as he didn’t show too much concern.</p>

<p>But…” Clear Sea King wished to say something more, but he was interrupted by Burning Lamp Alpha.</p>

<p>“First Day is practicing in Sky Palace. How is he doing?” Burning Lamp Alpha asked.</p>

<p>“He will be a Marquise soon,” Clear Sea King answered.</p>

<p>“Good. First Day isn’t as talented as Seven Spirit or Speechless, but he can match them in strength. Through his practice in Sky Palace, and a roster of talents that marry the best of two races, he might have a higher chance of becoming deified than Seven Spirit did. We cannot allow this opportunity to escape our grasp,” Burning Lamp said.</p>

<p>“Now that Han Sen is in Sky Palace, will he…” Clear Sea King was worried.</p>

<p>Burning Lamp said coldly, “Sky Palace has taken in Han Sen. They have also taken in First Day. There is no need to worry for First Day’s safety. Don’t do anything until Han Sen leaves Sky Palace. And don’t contact First Day. Wait until he is done in Sky Palace, too.”</p>

<p>Not long after, the day came again when White Jade Jing would open. Han Sen and Yun Suyi returned from Old Night Island. In that time, Han Sen had managed to hunt eleven Earl xenogeneics. But since Yun Suyi was with him, he hadn’t wanted to eat the xenogeneic genes in front of her. So, he brought everything back.</p>

<p>When the Jade Air in White Jade Jing came to an end, Han Sen brought the xenogeneic genes back to Jade Island.</p>

<p>“Yun Suyi, follow me home,” Yun Sushang called to her sister.</p>

<p>Yun Suyi glanced at Yun Sushang, looking all moody, and said, “Don’t worry, sis. I’m going home.”</p>

<p>Yun Sushang was shocked. She noticed there was something amiss with Yu Suyi’s attitude. With worry, she asked, “What’s going on? Has Han Sen been mistreating you?”</p>

<p>Yun Suyi shook her head and sighed. They were not real sisters, but their relationship was just as close as two blood relatives. They talked about everything, so she told Yun Sushang the things she had learned about Han Sen.</p>

<p>“I see. This is good, though. You are of the Sky, and you are a daughter of an elder. You cannot be with an outsider. By ending it now, you’re only saving yourself from greater suffering in the future.” Yun Sushang felt relief when she heard what was troubling Yun Suyi. So, she comforted her and said, “Han Sen is smart, but he is not the only one out there for you. There are other geniuses like him, amongst the Sky. I will find you someone, and you can decide.”</p>

<p>Yun Suyi wasn’t in the mood for jokes, and she was feeling very sad. She forced a smile and went home.</p>

<p>Because the next day was the exam, and Han Sen was in a rush, he didn’t have the time to eat slowly. After he cooked all his stuff in one pot, he used Consume to digest every xenogeneic material as fast as he could.</p>

<p>His body felt hot, cold, and sore, all at the same time. He felt as if he had been electrified, and some power flowed through his body. It made him feel stronger.</p>

<p>The gene increase announcement played in his head, over and over. He had an extra eleven Earl genes, now. Counting the two from before, he now had forty in total.</p>

<p>But when Han Sen picked up the Blood God Mantis’ mutant gene, the announcement still declared he did not have a sufficient number of Earl genes.</p>

<p>“Blood God Mantis1 gene has a much higher requirement than the ant queen gene, but now I don’t have any more time to hunt xenogeneics.” Han Sen put away the Blood God Mantis’ mutant gene. He sat on his jade bed to practice Jadeskin.</p>

<p>Although it was not as fast as practicing in the White Jade Building, having a little was better than nothing.</p>

<p>The next morning, when Han Sen was about to set off toward the exam location, Yu Jing came to him. He rode over on a Jade Night Crane.</p>

<p>“Brother Han, there is something I seek to discuss with you.” Yu Jing spoke quickly, upon his arrival on the island. “What is it?” Han Sen looked at Yu Jing.</p>

<p>Yu Jing lowered his voice and said, “The first opponent you face today, he hopes he can proceed through the exam. So, he paid a high price, hoping you might let him go on.”</p>

<p>Yu Jing didn’t say it directly, but he meant that the opponent had paid money for Han Sen to throw the fight.</p>

<p>“Sorry, I can’t help him,” Han Sen said simply.</p>

<p>Yu Jing quickly said, “Brother Han, you do know that your sixth enemy is Lone Bamboo, yes? It is difficult to determine whether or not you’ll win. It would be better to take this benefit now, while you can.”</p>

<p>When Yu Jing said that it was difficult to determine who would win, he really meant that Han Sen would most likely lose. And if Han Sen lost, all Yu Jing’s money would be lost. Right now, he was only concerned with losing as little as possible.</p>

<p>“My purpose is to get to first place. I don’t care about anything else.” After Han Sen said that, he mounted the legless crane. He flew straight towards Sky Path Island, where the exams would be held.</p>

<p>Yu Jing was shocked. He was frozen in place for a while.</p>

<p>After a while, he snapped out of his daze. He spoke to himself miserably, saying, “I hope you can reach first place, too. But how are you going to beat Lone Bamboo?”</p>
