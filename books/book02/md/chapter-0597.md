Han Sen couldn't take his eyes off Princess Yin and Princess Yang. The Mermaid Princess had the ability to control the Crystal Palace, so he wondered if either of these princesses possessed any special abilities he could employ, as well.

Princess Yin and Princess Yang looked at each other. They raised up their swords together, producing two lights; one silver and one gold. Then, in a flash, they both fused together to become a whole new woman clad in gold and silver armor. One iris was gold, the other silver. One hand clutched a silver sword, whereas the other held a golden sword.

"Hmm, they have formed to become one person?" Han Sen looked at this new spirit lady they had transformed into. He was puzzled, unable to understand why they did not do this before, when he fought them in the Spirit Hall.

He then watched the lady spirit move towards the cracks in the ground that the silver beetles crawled out of. Extending her silver sword outwards, she drove it down into the crevice.

Then, with her remaining gold sword, she swirled and twirled it around in the air. After a while of doing this, Han Sen suddenly felt the ground begin to rumble like an earthquake. Then a squealing noise sounded from below the earth as plumes of dust shot out of the crevice like a dirty exhaust.

*Boom!*

The spirit lady continued to wave the golden sword in her hand as the silver sword rattled and returned from its earthen sheath. Through magic, it floated in the air and twirled around the spirit lady in a similar way to the golden sword, until it reached the hand that awaited its return.

"Master, the silver beetles Mother has been killed," the spirit lady reported to Han Sen.

Han Sen didn't need the report, however, for he already knew the result through the notification he had received.

> "Princess Yin And Princess Yang Slew The Silver Beetle Mother. The Beast Soul Was Not Acquired. Consume Its Flesh To Obtain A Random Numeric Amount Of Sacred Geno Points, Ranging From Zero To Ten."

The silver beetles were round, but they now looked like wilted flowers. As they lay on the ground in lifeless mounds, they quickly decomposed and vanished out of sight.

"So, this is what it feels like to have someone else do your dirty work..." Han Sen opened his eyes wide and looked at the spirit lady with admiration.

"Master, that was a YinYang sword skill, not 'dirty work.'" Not one for humor, the spirit lady corrected Han Sen.

"When we used to fight, why did you not use this skill?" Han Sen curiously enquired.

"Combining Yin and Yang together does not increase our power. It only enables me to use this particular sword skill." The YinYang Princess explained.

"Ah, that's why. If that's the case, then you two should split up." Han Sen believed having two women was better than one, so he recommended they remain as Princess Yin and Princess Yang.

Han Sen then prepared to return to the shelter, but that was when he faintly saw a shadow appear from behind a glacier. When he took a closer look, he noticed that it was Queen.

Queen stared at the silver fox in Han Sen's arms, and did not even look at him.

"Why are you here?" Han Sen frowned, looking at Queen with alarm. If Queen was going to come after the silver fox, he wasn't sure if it could beat her.

Although the silver fox was powerful, it was still just a pup. The power was nowhere near what it could one day become. Facing an ordinary evolver who had unlocked the first gene lock seemed to be okay, but the thought of it facing Queen made Han Sen uncertain.

The silver fox returned Queen's gaze, just as it did when it first saw Xue Yikuang.

Queen then turned to look at Han Sen and said, "Your pet seems to be quite special. What class is it?"

"Sacred-blood class," Han Sen answered Queen immediately, with no hesitation in his lie.

Although he knew Queen wanted to hunt super creatures, he did not know if she actually had yet. Because of this, Han Sen did not wish to say anything more.

Queen continued to peer at Han Sen but did not say anything. She then returned her watch to the silver fox and said, "You know, there is still one more class above sacred-blood creatures. I formed a team composed of people who have each unlocked their first gene lock. Our purpose is to hunt those monsters. Are you interested?"

"I still haven't unlocked my first gene lock; I thought I wouldn't be qualified to join you," Han Sen said.

"With that pet at your side, I would say you are qualified." Queen pointed to the silver fox.

"Never mind, then. I don't think I have the abilities to go with you. I can't rely on a pet to keep me alive. Besides, the existence of those creatures is little more than a myth. Have you killed any to confirm?" Han Sen asked.

Queen did not answer, all she said was, "Well, the invitation is always open. If you change your mind, seek me out through Pingqing." And then she left as quickly as she appeared.

Queen secretly thought that the creature Han Sen possessed was a super creature, but she had never killed one before. Therefore, she could not be certain and all she could do was guess.

After a hundred years of development, humans were getting more and more powerful in the Second God's Sanctuary. Still, humans that could unlock their gene lock in the Second God's Sanctuary were very rare.

Queen spent a lot of time trying to gather such individuals, and despite trying her best, she had only been able to invite seven. Most of them had their own territory, so finding seven people on her own was quite impressive.

But even with a team of such considerable power, they still could not kill creatures that were above the sacred-blood class. Such foes had the same abilities, but the powers that fuelled them were several times stronger.

According to their estimations, for humans to unlock their first gene lock, their fitness level would have to reach three hundred. This was also the level of a Celestial Being. Once this level was reached, and a gene lock was unlocked, only then could they be capable of taking on a super creature.

But all of this was nigh impossible to achieve in the Second God's Sanctuary. To kill creatures such as that, humans would need numbers, and they'd have to cooperate.

But so far, not a single faction had managed to band together and take one down.

And in regards to Han Sen's pet, Queen was captivated by it. Han Sen may not have killed a super creature, but how had he managed to tame one?

If Han Sen told her he had already beaten a super creature, she would not have believed him.

Although Han Sen was a powerful person, he had not yet unlocked his gene lock. He couldn't survive against a person with an unlocked gene lock by himself. So, if he couldn't do that, he most certainly couldn't go up against a super creature.

Queen considered that Han Sen's pet may have been a berserk sacred-blood beast soul. Although the chances were slim, that could be what had given it special abilities.

But the silver fox was not a beast soul; that meant it had to be a super creature.

How could anyone judge her scepticism? After all, no one had been known to tame a creature before. Only those spoken about in legends.

The reason why Queen invited Han Sen was because she had witnessed the power of the silver fox and Han Sen together. She used to teach Han Sen, so she could more accurately gauge how he had grown and where he would continue to go. His potential and the likely course of his future was frighteningly impressive. If he unlocked the first gene lock, he'd be a scary master to have and a terrifying foe to face.

To be close with a character such as that, Queen was keen to have him in her party as soon as possible.
