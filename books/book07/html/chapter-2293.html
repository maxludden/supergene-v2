<h2>Passing the Test</h2>
<h3>Chapter 2293</h3>

<p>“Dad, the woman has no more blood. Dad… he cracked open the
woman’s brain…” Bao’er kept reporting what was happening.</p>
<p>“Bao’er, stop looking!” Han Sen called Bao’er back into his
arms. He didn’t want her to see such a bloody scene.</p>
<p>Bao’er was actually quite old at this point, but in Han Sen’s
eyes, she’d be a little girl forever.</p>
<p>Bao’er jumped off of Han Sen’s shoulder to sit on his chest. She
looked curiously at the Four Symbols Seal and the trapped
xenogeneic that was still struggling inside.</p>
<p>Han Sen still couldn’t feel anything behind him, but after
hearing what Bao’er had said, he felt sick with worry. The images
of what she had described kept repeating inside his mind, and
nothing he tried to think about could scrub them away.</p>
<p>“Jade Cat, what are you doing!” Han Sen finally shouted at the
statue of the jade cat.</p>
<p>The jade cat already seemed to be sleeping again, and it showed
no reaction to Han Sen’s call.</p>
<p>After a while, the prisoner’s chains began to rattle again. As
it left the space behind Han Sen’s back, it slowly entered his
field of vision. The prisoner left in pretty much the same manner
that he arrived, slowly and seemingly vacant-minded.</p>
<p>There was one small difference, however. He was dragging the
corpse of a woman behind him.</p>
<p>To be more accurate, that was not the body of a woman. It was a
female creature’s body.</p>
<p>Han Sen couldn’t see what the female creature’s facial features
had been, because a large hole had been punched into the creature’s
head. There was a gaping cavity where the face had been. The upper
part of her body was humanoid, though, and the lower body was like
a snake. She looked like one of the Ghana, but unlike the Ghana,
there was a spiraling horn on her head. It was silver and around
one foot long, and it was reminiscent of a unicorn’s horn.</p>
<p>The snake scales of her lower body were silver, as well. They
were so bright that they made her form seem a little transparent.
Holes had been torn through her head and chest, but there was no
blood oozing out. It was just as Bao’er had originally said, in
that the blood of the woman had run dry.</p>
<p>“What is that weirdo’s presence here supposed to mean? Why would
he draw a woman on my back?” Han Sen wondered, somewhat shaken.</p>
<p>But Han Sen didn’t seem to be injured or impaired. His body was
fine, his Galactic Lobster Armor was fine, and it looked like the
creepy prisoner guy was leaving now that he had drawn his
picture.</p>
<p>Although the whole experience had been rather disturbing, the
creature hadn’t actually hurt him. So, Han Sen knew he’d just have
to stop thinking about it.</p>
<p>“Bao’er! Could you use some water to wash your dad’s armor? Wash
away the mess he made,” Han Sen said to Bao’er. While the paint
hadn’t been harmful, he was still unhappy to have it on him.</p>
<p>Bao’er jumped off of Han Sen’s chest and walked behind him to do
as he asked. Then her surprised voice said, “She is gone!”</p>
<p>“What is gone?” Han Sen’s heart jumped into his throat.</p>
<p>“The picture he drew is now gone,” Bao’er said.</p>
<p>“How could it be gone?” Han Sen was very confused about this,
and so he proceeded to ask, “Did the picture just get smeared?”</p>
<p>Bao’er shook her head. “Dad, there’s nothing on your back. It is
very clean, and there is not even the smallest semblance of a
bloodstain. The ugly woman drawing is all gone.”</p>
<p>Han Sen had no idea what to make of this, so he asked Mister
White, “Mister White, what is going on?”</p>
<p>Mister White shook his head. “I don’t understand any of this,
either. We couldn’t see your back, and we were only able to see
that he was drawing something on you. I don’t know what it was that
he actually drew.”</p>
<p>Han Sen didn’t like not knowing, but there was little that he
could do about it. He checked his body and noted how nothing seemed
to have happened, so for now, he shelved all thoughts about it.</p>
<p>Nothing strange happened after that. The four of them kept
sending power into the Four Symbols Seal. It maintained a firm hold
on the snared xenogeneic clone. Days passed, and after what felt
like forever, they reached the ten-day deadline.</p>
<p>Although the four of them were quite exhausted by this point,
they had at least managed to survive the ten days.</p>
<p>When the xenogeneics returned to their palace lairs and the
doors of their palaces closed, the four of them almost
collapsed.</p>
<p>The jade cat statue smiled and began speaking again.
“Congratulations! You have passed the Sacred Leader’s test. You can
now receive the relic left behind by the Sacred Leader.”</p>
<p>“Where is the treasure?” Han Sen asked, forcing himself to
ignore his exhaustion.</p>
<p>“Right here,” the jade cat statue said. The jade pillar below
its feet then suddenly opened up, revealing a small jade box. It
was impossible to guess what might lay inside.</p>
<p>Han Sen started forward to pick up the box, but then, his heart
jumped up. He saw that Crime was holding a broken sword, slashing
towards Han Sen.</p>
<p>The blood kirin was angered by this, and so it roared and leaped
towards Crime.</p>
<p>But Crime’s darkness covered everything, and Han Sen’s eyes were
unable to pierce it.</p>
<p>Han Sen didn’t move his eyes, though. The bird’s nest was still
on his head, and he leaped towards where the box had been before
everything went black.</p>
<p>In Crime’s area-of-effect, all seven of Han Sen’s senses were
blocked. But because he had the protection of the bird’s nest, he
wasn’t concerned about any attacks that Crime might launch.</p>
<p>But the next second, Han Sen’s face changed. A weird power came
down to strike the bird’s nest. The power locked onto the bird’s
nest and pulled it away from Han Sen’s head.</p>
<p>Then, he and Bao’er were tied up by something like a rope. The
rope jerked them roughly to the side.</p>
<p>The darkness faded. Han Sen noticed that he and Bao’er were now
bound by loop upon loop of white rope. Next to them, there was a
net with Han Sen’s bird’s nest inside it. The net must have been
quite special if it was able to bind a deified bird’s nest.</p>
<p>Crime held the net in one hand and the jade box in the
other.</p>
<p>“Thank you for helping me obtain the Sacred Leader’s treasure,”
Crime said coldly to Han Sen, holding the box casually under one
arm.</p>
<p>“Who are you?” Mister White frowned at Crime.</p>
<p>Crime smiled and said, “Mister White, I am your faithful guard
Crime.”</p>
<p>“You look like Crime, but Crime is just a King-class guard. You
most certainly aren’t. Crime wouldn’t possess Prince Fourteen’s Sky
Net,” Mister White stated flatly, his frown deepening.</p>
<p>Crime slid the box into his chest pocket. Then, he lifted his
broken knife and spoke to Mister White. “You think too much.
Although I am half-deified, I am still your guard. But aside from
you, I have a duty to Prince Fourteen, as well. Prince Fourteen
wants this item, so I will have to take this back with me.”</p>
<p>“Mister White, we both work for Prince Fourteen. You have helped
me a great deal, and I will tell Prince Fourteen of your
involvement. But this is not where this should be discussed… We
need to get rid of him first,” Crime said. Then his broken knife
came swinging towards Han Sen.</p>
