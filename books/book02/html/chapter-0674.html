    <p>
      Even though members of the Ji family did not believe it was true, many
      others had come to ask them about Han Sen&#8217;s obtaining a Life Geno
      essence. Many officers and organizations from all across the Alliance came
      to ask them, all due to the belief that Han Sen was a part of the Ji
      family.
    </p>

    <p>
      Being in such a spotlight forced the Ji family to take the topic
      seriously. Words of the deed also reached the very top of the family, Ji
      Ruozhen.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;My baby girl, it looks as if you&#8217;ve found quite the
      man.&#8221; Ji Ruozhen had a wry smile, as he perused the information
      concerning Han Sen. He picked up his communicator and gave Ji Yanran a
      call.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Dad, you will be the president soon. How can you find time to give
      your lonely daughter a call?&#8221; Ji Yanran said, with a sulky voice.
    </p>

    <p>
      In the past two years, Ji Ruozhen had been running for an election to be
      president of the Alliance and because of this, his care and concern for
      familial matters had lagged. His time for Ji Yanran was one such
      consequence, but despite her sourness over the slight neglection, she knew
      how busy such important matters made him.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Don&#8217;t say that; I&#8217;m only part of the election.&#8221;
      Ji Ruozhen gave a warm smile, then continued to say, &#8220;Your father
      has been really busy recently, but the reason I have come looking for you
      right now is a matter that concerns my future son-in-law.&#8221;
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Why? What has happened with Han Sen? Has something gone
      wrong?&#8221; Ji Yanran&#8217;s face changed.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Something has happened, yes; and it&#8217;s quite the
      shocker,&#8221; Ji Ruozhen stopped smiling to say these words with modest
      seriousness.
    </p>

    <p>&#8220;What happened?&#8221; Ji Yanran quickly asked.</p>

    <p>
      &#8220;He might have killed a super creature in the Second God&#8217;s
      Sanctuary. Could you aid me in asking around and evaluating the
      authenticity of this tale, and&#8230;&#8221; Ji Ruozhen would not beat
      around the bush when it came to communicating with his daughter. He knew
      her well, and she preferred being told things straight—no matter how
      favorable or unfavorable the subject of discussion was.
    </p>

    <p>
      Ji Yanran showed a look of both shock and joy. She knew her boyfriend was
      good, but if he had achieved such a dizzying feat, that was way better
      than any of her previously lofty expectations.
    </p>

    <p>
      Because Ji Yanran wasn&#8217;t very talented in fighting, she didn&#8217;t
      care much for the fighting world or society. She didn&#8217;t stay in the
      loop much, but as with everyone else, she knew a lot about Ji Qing and the
      aid she received in her own felling of a super creature. The finances
      involved were high, particularly so for a single kill.
    </p>

    <p>
      But for Han Sen to silently slay a super creature of his own volition,
      with little to no support, was remarkable and shocking.
    </p>

    <p>
      The Second God&#8217;s Sanctuary&#8217;s super creatures were much harder
      than the ones that populated the First God&#8217;s Sanctuary, so it was
      difficult for others to wrap their heads around how Han Sen could have
      accomplished such a task.
    </p>

    <p>
      Ji Yanran then sought to give Han Sen a call but found that his line was
      busy; he was in a call with someone else.
    </p>

    <p>
      Ji Yanran hung up her communicator and did not push further. She knew it
      was only a matter of time before Han Sen would come looking for her. She
      was sure of it.
    </p>

    <p>
      When Han Sen returned to the Alliance, his communicator was ringing
      non-stop. When Han Sen took a look, there were countless missed calls. The
      person calling him right now was Qin Xuan.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen picked up his device and answered it. Qin Xuan&#8217;s image leapt
      out, immediately saying, &#8220;I know you are busy right now but I have
      to ask you this on behalf of my supervisor; did you really kill a super
      creature? And if you did, are you looking to sell the Life Geno
      essence?&#8221;
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;I did kill a super creature, yes. It was a Giant Frosty Bear. And
      no, I have no plans of selling the Life Geno essence. If I ever change my
      mind and have a look at flipping it, I&#8217;ll call you up first,&#8221;
      Han Sen said, smiling.
    </p>

    <p>
      Qin Xuan presented Han Sen with a complicated look. She had watched Han
      Sen grow up and always admired him, thinking he&#8217;d one day become
      someone quite special. That being said, she never dreamed Han Sen would be
      the first person to slay a super creature in the Second God&#8217;s
      Sanctuary.
    </p>

    <p>
      Countless other factions had vied to slay the first super creature, but
      none had managed it. Even right now, during the Ji family&#8217;s most
      successful era, they had to pay a great sum of money to hunt and kill a
      super creature in the First God&#8217;s Sanctuary.
    </p>

    <p>
      But Han Sen had killed a super creature in the Second God&#8217;s
      Sanctuary quietly, with no fanfare or support. Such a trial would have
      been unfathomably difficult in the First God&#8217;s Sanctuary, but far
      more so in the Second God&#8217;s Sanctuary.
    </p>

    <p>
      Everyone believed Han Sen belonged to the Ji family, but Qin Xuan knew
      that Han Sen didn&#8217;t. She didn&#8217;t think the Ji family gave him
      much help, if at all. He most likely slew the beast through the power of
      his own strength and abilities.
    </p>

    <p>
      It reminded her of the little boy who entered the shelter, back in the
      day. Right now, that little boy had ascended the social ladder and
      performed wondrous deeds that even the most financially-superfluous nobles
      could not dream of achieving. This thought made Qin Xuan feel strange,
      which was why she had a complicated expression.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Sure. Contact me if you change your mind, then. You must be busy
      right now, so I shan&#8217;t bother you further,&#8221; Qin Xuan told Han
      Sen, with a smile.
    </p>

    <p>&#8220;Goodbye, Captain. Talk again soon,&#8221; Han Sen said.</p>

    <p>
      Han Sen hung up the communicator and then turned it off completely. There
      were too many people trying to get in touch with him. Half of these were
      people he did not even know, so he couldn&#8217;t be bothered to answer
      the communicator every time it rang.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen left his room to visit Ji Yanran&#8217;s office. Now that the
      whole world seemed to know what he had done, he felt she deserved a more
      thorough explanation.
    </p>

    <p>
      As he was standing near her office&#8217;s door, Han Sen saw Annie. The
      way she looked at him this day was not the same as it used to be; it was
      not cold, and it looked as if there was something on her mind that she
      wished to tell him.
    </p>

    <p>
      Annie was much stronger than Han Sen, as the two were not of the same
      level. But now, Annie did not dare underestimate Han Sen.
    </p>

    <p>
      She had heard the news of Han Sen&#8217;s achievement, in which he had
      killed a super creature. Anyone who had performed a task as great as that
      should be respected.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen did what he did without the support of other factions, yet people
      believed he had the backing of the Ji family. Annie knew the truth; she
      knew that the Ji family had not helped him in any way and that he had
      never asked for any help, either.
    </p>

    <p>
      The only help Han Sen had ever received from the Ji family was when Ji
      Yanran exerted the influence of her position to obtain Daphne for him. It
      was because of this that Annie had always believed Han Sen to be a loser,
      leeching on the Ji family.
    </p>

    <p>
      But ever since that one time, Han Sen had not used Ji Yanran or her
      position as a way to receive anything. He killed a super creature solo,
      which was staggering.
    </p>

    <p>
      Annie knew how difficult it was to achieve half of what he had done, and
      that was with support. Han Sen had achieved this all without support and
      done something she had believed to be impossible. He shocked not only her,
      but everyone else in the Alliance as well.
    </p>

    <p>
      Now Annie could no longer deem the name &#8220;Han Sen&#8221; synonymous
      with the word &#8220;loser.&#8221; Han Sen was always so relaxed, calm,
      and gentle with Ji Yanran. She thought it was just an act to attract Ji
      Yanran, but all of her perceptions on his personality had been altered.
      She felt as if she did not understand him anymore.
