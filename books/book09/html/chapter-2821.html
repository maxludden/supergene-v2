	<p>&#8220;Sky Vine Radish&#8217;s god spirit? Are you the creature that killed the god? Did you take Sky Vine
		Radish&#8217;s god spirit? I did not expect that a lowlife creature could do that.&#8221; Evil Lotus God stood
		up. He was still coughing up blood. His eyes were staring at Sky Vine Radish, who stood before Han Sen. Clearly,
		he could see Sky Vine Radish.</p>

	<p>Second Uncle and the others were even more shocked. When the god&#8217;s sadness happened, it made for a popular
		topic of conversation. For it now to be revealed that it was a xenogeneic that killed the god, it was pretty
		difficult to fathom.</p>

	<p>Han Sen&#8217;s face still did not change. Sky Vine Radish&#8217;s god spirit was still under his control. It had
		a scary green god light. It was madly attacking Evil Lotus God, or rather, the evil lotus&#8217;s purple, evil
		ghost spirit body.</p>

	<p>It was different from Han Sen, who was using his mind control to operate the god spirit. Evil Lotus God&#8217;s
		body seemed to exist alongside the purple, evil ghost spirit body. Its movements affected the purple, evil ghost
		spirit&#8217;s movements.</p>

	<p>Han Sen was watching the fight from afar. Evil Lotus God had to join the fight with all his might. If the purple,
		evil ghost spirit was damaged, Evil Lotus God himself would be damaged too.</p>

	<p>The purple, evil ghost spirit was fighting Sky Vine Radish like mad. Its scary power was able to destroy
		everything, but this power was too amazing. Aside from the purple, evil spirit, and Sky Vine Radish, no other
		substance in that universe could be affected by that power. Second Uncle and the others were not able to see the
		god spirit.</p>

	<p>From what they could tell, Han Sen was just floating in the air. He was watching Evil Lotus God, and Evil Lotus
		God was an insane lunatic flailing around in the air. He kept spitting out blood and flying away.</p>

	<p>&#8220;Who is Mister Holy Baby?&#8221; Londo mumbled. &#8220;He is so shockingly powerful. He looks like more of
		a god than Evil Lotus God does.&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;Maybe only the king knows where Holy Baby came from, and that is why the king accepted him as a student.
		He can fight against the gods. Only very rare true god class elites can do such a thing.&#8221; Second Uncle
		looked at Han Sen, who was in the sky, with a complex look.</p>

	<p>Ger&#8217;s expression looked strange as he said, &#8220;Even Evil Lotus God said Mister Holy Baby killed the
		god. Is that really true?&#8221;</p>

	<p>No one had the answer. They all wanted to know the answer too.</p>

	<p>Although Han Sen was the aggressive one, Sky Vine Radish&#8217;s god spirit power was not any stronger than Evil
		Lotus God&#8217;s god spirit. Their powers were almost the same.</p>

	<p>If Han Sen did not use the mistakes of Evil Lotus God and damage Evil Lotus God&#8217;s purple, evil spirit in
		the beginning, he could not suppress him now.</p>

	<p>&#8220;A low race is a low race. Even if you have a god spirit, you will only be used by others.&#8221; Evil
		Lotus God was suppressed, but he still looked very prideful. His eyes were burning brighter than ever. They even
		looked greedy. He looked at the Sky Vine Radish&#8217;s god spirit with greed.</p>

	<p>&#8220;It is enough to kill you.&#8221; Han Sen sensed that too. After Evil Lotus God combined with the purple,
		evil spirit, it had more agility. He directly used power more. It was not like he was using his mind to control
		the purple, evil spirit. After all, it was still not natural. Although he had the advantage, he could not beat
		the purple, evil spirit.</p>

	<p>In the fight, Han Sen was watching the purple, evil spirit, and Evil Lotus God. He knew for sure that the purple,
		evil spirit was a god spirit, but it was different from the Sky Vine Radish. Sky Vine Radish&#8217;s green god
		light was obviously a plant power, and the purple, evil spirit was of another element. Han Sen did not see what
		the difference was.</p>

	<p>I wonder if my body can be combined with the god spirit. Han Sen was looking at Evil Lotus God, wanting to know
		how he could combine with the god spirit to fight. He looked at him for a long time but could not see anything.
	</p>

	<p>Evil Lotus God suddenly and coldly said, &#8220;Ignorant lowlife creature. Me, a God, will let you know what the
		true power of a god spirit is.&#8221;</p>

	<p>While he was talking, the purple, evil spirit suddenly had a weird mark on its forehead. That mark was made of
		countless universal rules. It was just a godly miracle, but it showed endless miracles of the universe.</p>

	<p>Han Sen suddenly felt bad. When that mark appeared, Han Sen sensed that the purple, evil spirit body&#8217;s
		spirit power had increased. It was like it had been buffed by the power of the universe. It suddenly went
		through Sky Vine Radish and was wildly increasing.</p>

	<p>&#8220;By the name of Evil Lotus God, accept God&#8217;s punishment!&#8221; When Evil Lotus God&#8217;s god voice
		sounded, the purple, evil spirit&#8217;s hands clasped together to have him sit like a buddha. Beneath him was a
		purple, evil lotus. When that evil lotus opened, Han Sen felt the whole world was like a purple lotus flower
		that had opened. It was like he had fallen into an endless lotus pool.</p>

	<p>Han Sen looked at Second Uncle and the others. They had no reaction. They were not able to see the purple lotus
		flower.</p>

	<p>Han Sen had many questions to think over. He thought, It looks like Sky Vine Radish and the evil lotus power are
		just like the gods. They cannot affect other universal creatures, but why are their bodies different from Empty
		God, Sky Armor God, and the others? They can visit the universe and hurt the creatures of the universe.</p>

	<p>Evil Lotus God did not stop on the behalf of Han Sen&#8217;s pause. Many purple lotus flowers opened. They
		exploded. The power blew up Sky Vine Radish.</p>

	<p>Evil Lotus God walked with the purple, evil spirit and the purple lotus. It was madly attacking Sky Vine Radish.
	</p>

	<p>The purple, evil spirit&#8217;s power was much better than Sky Vine Radish, and it had the help of a purple
		lotus. Sky Vine Radish was at a bad disadvantage. The purple evil spirit kept attacking. Soon, the green light
		broke. A second later, an entire arm was severed.</p>

	<p>Han Sen was not injured because of that. He was different from Evil Lotus God. Even if Sky Vine Radish was
		killed, it would not affect him. Purple, evil spirit power did not affect his body. However, if Sky Vine Radish
		was killed, Han Sen would have nothing left to go against Evil Lotus God.</p>

	<p>His eyes were like blades. Han Sen moved his body. He was going into the battlefield. He knew that by depending
		on Sky Vine Radish, the battle would be lost. He had to co-operate with Sky Vine Radish if he wanted to defeat
		Evil Lotus God.</p>

	<p>Han Sen moved. Evil Lotus God knew what he was going to do. He looked disdained and said, &#8220;Ignorant lowlife
		creature. Do you think a god body cannot hurt your body and you can ignore it? You are so dumb.&#8221;</p>

	<p>Evil Lotus God punched Sky Vine Radish and threw a punch at Han Sen. The purple, evil spirit was doing the same
		thing and threw a punch at Han Sen too.</p>

	<p>Han Sen did not move. He threw out the suppressing plastic bag and punched it to make it shatter. Lots of pottery
		powder came out like a grey, dark mist.</p>

	<p>&#8220;Holy Kirin is strong, but if you think the ash can hurt a god, you are too naive.&#8221; Evil Lotus God
		continued with his punch. The purple, evil spirit broke through the ash.</p>
