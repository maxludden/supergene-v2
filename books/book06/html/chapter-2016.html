<p>Yun Changkong was the leader of the Yun family and the tenth
elder of Sky Palace. He was no stranger to Under the Sky.</p>
<p>Yun Suyi showed him her Under the Sky, and he immediately
recognized that it was different from the original version. But the
difference fixed the inherent problem it had once possessed. There
were no more flaws. It had become a skill that was perfectly usable
in battle.</p>
<p>“Suyi, did you really learn this from Han Sen?” Yun Changkong
hastily asked Yun Suyi after she finished her performance.</p>
<p>Yes. He’s been teaching me since I leveled up to become an
Earl.” Yun Suyi nodded.</p>
<p>“Father, does the modified Under the Sky really work?” Yun
Sushang asked.</p>
<p>“Yes, it looks like it really can. There’s one thing I don’t
understand, however; how can your knifeskill express the feelings
of the Textless Book?” Yun Changkong asked.</p>
<p>Yun Suyi quickly explained how Han Sen used his knifemind in a
way that allowed her to get a feel for it.</p>
<p>Yun Changkong heard this and gave a wry smile. “This Han Sen is
a genius. He has modified the knifeskill itself and used feelings
as its guidance. He did fix Under the Sky’s problem, and he has
made it usable in proper combat. He learned Under the Sky as a
beginner, then he expanded his understanding in order to abandon
the strict rules of the text and start infusing it with his own
emotions. He made something complicated far simpler.”</p>
<p>Yun Changkong thought for a minute, then continued. “An elder
once thought about doing this, but there were too many problems for
it to be effective. But it seems that is what Han Sen has done, and
somehow, he has finished it. This required a keen observation and a
profound understanding of the skill’s core. That which he has done
with his knife is something only a grandmaster could do. Assuming,
of course, that he is the one who has done all this.”</p>
<p>Yun Changkong stopped talking. He took Yun Suyi with him to meet
with the leader of Sky Palace.</p>
<p>The news of Under the Sky being fixed spread like wildfire, and
the position of Under the Sky changed. It became a geno art of the
palace, good and proper. It had a big impact on things, too.</p>
<p>Han Sen’s name was heard far and wide again, with Angia being
someplace on the sidelines. Whenever he was mentioned, it would be
just as the small character who it was showcased upon.</p>
<p>Han Sen did not know about this, though. He kept practicing and
doing his thing in Xuanyuan Cave until the White Jade Building was
ready to open. Han Sen went back to his Jade Island first, though.
And before he went on to White Jade Building, Thousand Feather
Crane came to see him.</p>
<p>“Brother Han, the leader has requested an audience with you.
Let’s pack you up, so we can go.” Thousand Feather Crane smiled to
Han Sen.</p>
<p>“The leader wants me for something?” Han Sen was surprised as he
looked on Thousand Feather Crane.</p>
<p>The leader was a very busy man, so he wouldn’t summon Han Sen
for nothing.</p>
<p>You don’t know? The Under the Sky modifications of yours, they
were verified and accepted by the leader. It has been accepted into
the library of Sky Palace’s legendary techniques. As the modifier,
you are to be given a reward. That’s why the leader has summoned
you.” Thousand Feather Crane smiled.</p>
<p>Han Sen, hearing this, was surprised. He hadn’t realized so many
things would happen while he was gone.</p>
<p>He followed Thousand Feather Crane to Sky Palace. When he walked
the Road to the Sky, he didn’t feel anything unusual. Only your
first time ascending would give you that sense of suppression.</p>
<p>Inside Sky Palace, many students looked at Han Sen strangely.
Their eyes were filled with admiration.</p>
<p>This was the first time Han Sen would get to see the Sky Palace
leader. Han Sen had met him once, but he hadn’t been fully
conscious at the time. He wasn’t sure what the leader really looked
like.</p>
<p>It turned out that the Sky Palace leader seemed fairly ordinary.
He looked like a common, middle-aged man. He did not look
intimidating, and he did not look holy. He just looked like a
normal guy.</p>
<p>Han Sen walked up to him and bowed. The leader of Sky Palace
looked at him with interest and smiled. “Stand up. You look better
than the last time I saw you.”</p>
<p>Yeah, that was terrible. Sorry about being so useless.” Han Sen
felt embarrassed. It was terrible that Thousand Feather Crane had
to carry him in.</p>
<p>The leader of Sky Palace squinted his eyes at Han Sen. “You are
not useless. You finished modifying Under the Sky with success.
That is something many people have longed to fix. If you were
useless, then what are my elders?”</p>
<p>“I didn’t mean it that way.” Han Sen lowered his head.</p>
<p>The leader of Sky Palace laughed and said, “Don’t be so polite.
Your master, Yisha, wasn’t like you. She never really was polite,
but I liked her how she was.”</p>
<p>Han Sen had no idea Yisha was held with such high regard in Sky
Palace. It looked like the leader of Sky Palace still missed her
somewhat.</p>
<p>“Did this old man fall in love with his student? Is that why he
misses her so much?” Han Sen wondered.</p>
<p>The leader’s face turned stony. He flicked his finger, and
suddenly, Han Sen felt incredibly heavy. He almost collapsed on the
floor.</p>
<p>“Hmm, you little brat! You look respectable enough, but you were
thinking something sordid in your mind.” The leader of Sky Palace
looked at Han Sen and grunted.</p>
<p>Han Sen was suddenly covered in cold sweat. The leader could see
through Han Sen’s mind. That was a scary power for someone to
have.</p>
<p>“I apologize!” Han Sen said, as quickly and sincerely as he
could.</p>
<p>The leader of Sky Palace laughed and said, “Yisha always yelled
at me, but she did so directly. Unlike you, who keeps your real
opinions in the privacy of your mind.”</p>
<p>“This guy is a creep! He loves to be yelled at, so he must be a
masochist.” Han Sen couldn’t help but think.</p>
<p>As soon as the thought crossed his mind, he knew he had done
something bad.</p>
<p>The leader of Sky Palace smiled at Han Sen, and even more
pressure dropped onto him. It was a struggle not to fall to his
knees.</p>
<p>“I really know I did wrong this time!” Han Sen shouted, his face
looking bitter.</p>
<p>The leader of Sky Palace smiled and said, “It’s okay. You are
Yisha’s student, and you have been a great help to Sky Palace.
Under the Sky’s modifications are good. Tell me what you would
like.”</p>
<p>“It was my pleasure to help you. I wouldn’t dare be bold enough
to ask for a reward,” Han Sen said quickly.</p>
<p>“It is fine. You are not that humble, so there is no use
pretending that you are.” The Sky Palace leader grinned. “How about
this? Yisha used to feed horses, and you can feed horses, too. That
will be your reward for the modifications.”</p>
<p>“Thanks.” Han Sen forced his mind not to think of anything
else.</p>
