<p>“I am willing to.” Du Ru Lan kowtowed.</p>
<p>“If you are willing to, Decapitation Queen, you should take him
to the side hall and test his Blood-Pulse.” Han Sen did not plan on
giving Burning Lamp God of Wealth’s blood. He wanted it to be given
by Decapitation Queen.</p>
<p>As to what Blood-Pulse he would give to Burning Lamp, that
purely depended on his talent. He was willing to take care of him,
but he would not force Decapitation Queen to give him a lifetime of
Blood-Pulses for him.</p>
<p>When Du Ru Lan heard the God of Wealth statue speak, she was
shocked. She watched Decapitation Queen walk to the side hall.
After she thanked him, she followed Decapitation Queen.</p>
<p>Du Ru Lan was from a good family. She saw the side hall’s
Decapitation Queen statue and knew Decapitation Queen was God of
Wealth Temple’s sub-god. She felt disappointed.</p>
<p>The main god of the temple was the strongest. No matter how good
the Blood-Pulse was, obeying the sub-god was as good as the main
one.</p>
<p>Considering everything that had happened, Du Ru Lan could not
really voice a complaint. It was miraculous enough that she was
still drawing breath. Beggars could not be choosers.</p>
<p>Decapitation Queen took the little boy to the altar. She placed
the boy on it and told him, “If you are willing to obey me, pick up
the knife and cut one of your fingers. Place your blood on the god
stove.”</p>
<p>“Mister, he is still so young. Let me help him.” Du Ru Lan stood
up, ready to help him. Suddenly, she was unable to move. She was
kept in place by some scary power. “This is his choice,”
Decapitation Queen coldly said.</p>
<p>Du Ru Lan could neither speak nor move. She was looking at her
son with a heart that raged like a fire.</p>
<p>The little boy was special. After all that had happened, he had
not cried and or shouted. He listened to Decapitation Queen and
stood up. He picked up the sacrificial knife from the altar and cut
his finger. He let the blood drop onto the god stove.</p>
<p>Boom!</p>
<p>A purple and black fire was on the god stove. It turned into
demon fire that shocked the sky. The whole side hall was full of a
murderous air. Some of the air rushed out into the sky from the
guillotine.</p>
<p>Han Sen was in the main hall laughing. “Burning Lamp really is
Burning Lamp. Although he has been reborn, he is still very
special.”</p>
<p>Thinking of Burning Lamp being able to raise the Buddha from
being a no-name race to a race that was full of elites and had
almost become a high race, it proved his power was very strong
“Mister, Decapitation Queen wants to make a God Spirit deal with
him,” Decapitation Queen said while kneeling before the God of
Wealth statue. “I want to make him an inheritable Blood-Pulse.”</p>
<p>“Sure.” Han Sen only said that one word.</p>
<p>Decapitation Queen did not hesitate. A purple and black flame
arouse on the guillotine and doll. They turned into a scary fire
that headed for the little boy.</p>
<p>The little boy’s body was wrapped up by a purple and black
flame. His forehead possessed a strange marking that resembled a
guillotine. Within that mark, there was another mark that
referenced it to be an Annihilation God Spirit.</p>
<p>“Decapitation Queen is an Annihilation God Spirit?” Du Ru Lan
was as much shocked as she was happy. She could not believe what
she was seeing</p>
<p>A god temple’s sub-god was an Annihilation God Spirit. The main
god must have been a supreme existence. She could not imagine how
scary it had to be.</p>
<p>“The gods pity us. My child finally has hope.” Du Ru Lan was so
happy that she cried.</p>
<p>Han Sen saw the little boy compose a deal with Decapitation
Queen. He was now an inheritor of Decapitation Queen’s Blood-Pulse.
Han Sen’s face looked weird as he started to think about some
strange scenes.</p>
<p>He thought about the little boy growing up to be very kind, just
like Burning Lamp Alpha, but his hands would be holding a
guillotine, killing countless droves of people. Han Sen thought it
would be extremely weird.</p>
<p>In the Feng family’s castle’s little garden, Qin Bai and Bao’er
were sitting next to each other while playing chess. “Bao’er, do
you know how to play checkers?” Qin Bai cockily asked. “I can teach
you how to play it.”</p>
<p>Bao’er looked at him with disdain. She lifted her lips and said,
“You learned checkers from my father.”</p>
<p>“Oh, I forgot that,” Qin Bai said with a laugh. “You are Han
Sen’s daughter, so how could you not know checkers? That is good.
How about we play 300 rounds? I won’t let you win once.”</p>
<p>“You need to keep your promise,” Bao’er said with a smile. “You
have to play 300 rounds.” “Of course, you can go first.” Qin Bai
sounded very confident.</p>
<p>He loved playing checkers. If he did not need to practice with
his sword, he would not mind playing a few rounds.</p>
<p>Bao’er accepted the challenge. She picked up her chess piece and
made the first move.</p>
<p>After doing that, Bai Qin thought it was not normal. It felt as
if there was a sword air that shocked the sky coming at him. It
gave him the feeling that the sky could break.</p>
<p>Qin Bai wanted to scream, but he noticed he was unable to move.
He watched the sword air that shocked the sky go into his brain. He
peed himself.</p>
<p>Of course, that was not a real sword air. It was just Bao’er’s
Heart Sword Path. That sword skill was Six Path King’s sword skill.
Han Sen had learned it as well. He had not mastered it, but he used
it now and again. Bao’er had learned it from him too.</p>
<p>Now, Bao’er used the Heart Sword skill to simulate the Wavy
Sword Skill’s sword mind. She used it to attack Qin Bai’s will to
feel the sword skill’s sword mind.</p>
<p>Learning was very hard, especially for people who did not want
to learn. It made it much harder.</p>
<p>There was one condition in which people could learn fast and
never forget. There was a saying if one failed once, one would
learn from the mistakes to get better. It meant the more
disadvantages one had, the more one would remember. It did not make
a person smarter.</p>
<p>The more it hurt, the easier it was to recall the mistake.
Bao’er used that method. She wanted the crown prince to remember
the Wavy Sword Mind.</p>
<p>Qin Bai’s tragic life had now begun. He noticed he could no
longer scream or move. His body was uncontrollably playing a chess
game with Bao’er.</p>
<p>Whenever Bao’er made a move, it would become a scary Wavy Sword
Mind attacking him. Even though he knew the sword mind would not
kill him, it still made Qin Bai experience a lot of pain.</p>
<p>The sword mind’s pressure was something extremely difficult for
most people to endure. The pain from the Heart Sword was not just
pain in the body. Qin Bai had to get attacked by that scary sword
skill again and again. Every time it happened, it made Qin Bai feel
as if he was dying. He felt absolutely awful.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the guards had no idea what was going on. They
thought Qin Bai was peacefully playing chess with Bao’er. No one
knew Qin Bai was suffering pain that was too unbearable for most
humans to endure.</p>
<p>Teacher Jia Yi Zhen was in a good mood. Crown Prince Qin Bai was
scared of her. No matter how naughty he was, he always listened to
her. He always did her homework seriously.</p>
<p>This time, Qin Bai had not practiced the sword skills. He had
left the palace to go and play. Jia Yi Zhen was very worried about
the future of the Qin Kingdom.</p>
