The universe was dead silent. All of the creatures were watching Dollar stroke Golden Growler’s head. They could not believe it was the same Golden Growler who had scared off Very High Leader. “Little Mountain… Little Mountain Leader… What is it doing?” The green-haired beast’s jaw nearly dropped to the floor. After he realized what was going on, he madly stomped his feet and screamed, “How dare he touch Little Mountain Leader’s head! I am going to destroy his dirty fingers.”

The woman nearby had only just realized what was going on. She looked at the green-haired beast seriously and said, “When you brought Little Mountain Leader back, it already had a lower-race companion. Was that low-race person Dollar?”

“No, it was a crystallizer. He was of a different race to this xenogeneic. There is no way it was this guy who could level up so quickly. But…” The green-haired beast hesitated.

“But what?” the woman asked with a frown.

“That crystallizer is now quite famous in the universe,” the green-haired beast said. “It was Han Sen, who is in Space Garden now.”

“Han Sen?” the woman asked with shock. After a deep thought, she said, “It’s him!”

Right now, the universe was all messed up. The two of them were not able to speak anymore. They had not expected things to take such a drastic turn.

“What is going on? Why does Golden Growler look like Dollar’s pet?”

“Dollar… Golden Growler… They must have some sort of connection. I should have thought about that.”

“No way! The geno god list’s No. 1 is Dollar’s pet?”

It was not just ordinary creatures feeling this way. Even the old antiques, who had hidden away in the dark, and the higher races all had strange expressions.

The woman in Sky Palace was also shocked. “Who is this Dollar? Empty Mountain’s Golden Growler is treating him like this… The Growlers were always very cruel and cold. They never got close to outsiders.”

Sky Palace Leader thought, “Dollar is very special. He has a god personality armament, law power, and a relationship with Golden Growler. I wonder what faction created such a person.”

In the Extreme King garden, God watched Han Sen and Golden Growler with great interest. “I did not expect you to be this interesting. You have surpassed my expectations. This was certainly not a wasted trip.”

Golden Growler’s claws came off of Han Sen’s shoulders. It opened its mouth and spat something into Han Sen’s hands.

Han Sen picked it up and had a look. It was a crystal body that had been generated by thunder. It looked like countless lightning bolts were broiling around inside it. It was like a mini thunder universe.

“Is this Ancient Thunder God’s Ancient God Origin?” Han Sen recognized what he had been given. He already had Ancient Water God’s origin. It looked very similar. It was just this new one was a thunder element whereas the other one was water-based.

“Roar!” Little Gold Gold growled at Han Sen.

Han Sen and Little Gold Gold had a special connection similar to Little Angel. They were Han Sen’s beast souls. Their bodies had been rebuilt to become genuine lifeforms that existed independently. Yet, they still had a connection to Han Sen, who could understand their thoughts. Little Gold Gold had recognized Han Sen because of that connection.

Little Gold Gold was saying he wanted to give Han Sen the Ancient Thunder God Origin so he could pass it on to Little Silver. He said it would help Little Silver a lot.

“So, this was not for me, after all?” Han Sen felt a little touched. He had not expected Golden Growler to remember Little Silver. He reached out his hand and stroked its head.

In the eyes of others, this scene had them seeing Golden Growler merrily swinging its tail like a hunting dog having captured prey to give to its master.

“Oh my God… Dollar can’t actually be Golden Growler’s master, can he?” “If things are really like that, then that is too scary. A pet has suppressed the whole universe and claimed the No. 1 spot on the geno god list.”

“It really does seem like things are that way.”

Empty Mountain’s green-haired beast was as mad as a lunatic. He kept stomping around. He wanted to kill Dollar and 180 of his generations.

“You should go now. I will look for you in Empty Mountain.” Han Sen patted Golden Growler on the head and allowed it to exit the space battleground. In that way, Golden Growler was able to keep first place.

Golden Growler shook its head and growled. Han Sen knew what he meant. Golden Growler was going to give first place to Han Sen. Han Sen was going to reject it, but Golden Growler growled at him and lowered its body. It wanted Han Sen to ride him.

“Dollar! How dare you!” The green-haired beast yelled. It was like a volcano eruption. He slapped the floor, making Empty Mountain shake. Every other creature reacted by falling to the ground in fear.

Everybody was watching Han Sen ride Golden Growler’s back. Suddenly, Golden Growler ripped space and exited the geno god list. “What is going on? Why did they leave the space battleground together? Who lost?” All of the audience was in shock. They had no idea what was going on.

“Quick, look at the geno god list. Dollar is on top. It looks like Dollar won. No… Dollar won…” People started talking nonsense. Everybody turned to look at the geno god list. The geno god list’s top place was now showing Dollar instead of Golden Growler, which had taken Han Sen’s previous position of No. 25.

“Dollar… He is awesome. He let his pet get first place so he could be given it back…”

“If you have what it takes, you can have a Golden Growler for a pet.”

“I think only Dollar has what it takes to do that. In the universe, there is no other Golden Growler.”

While everyone was talking, Golden Growler took Han Sen out of the geno god list. They did not teleport back to where they were. They were nearby in space floating next to the geno god list.

“y.

Everyone was wondering why Golden Growler and Han Sen had not teleported away. Suddenly, Golden Growler roared to the sky. Its body had a golden light that was like a flood. It went into the sky to tear up space. Under Golden Growler’s power, space had a crack. An old, godly temple appeared. It was the geno hall. “What is going on? I do not think the geno god list fights are over yet. Are they giving out the prizes already?” “Prize your ass. Did you not see Golden Growler rip space and summon the geno hall? They are going to the geno hall.”

“Holy shit! They are going to the geno hall? Can he do that? Ancient Water God failed not too long ago.”

“It gave Dollar first place. It gave up the chance to become a God Spirit. The only chance to become a God Spirit is to enter the geno hall. That is expected.”

When the geno hall descended, the whole universe felt like it went dim. Only the geno hall was shining with holy light. It was slowly coming out from space.
