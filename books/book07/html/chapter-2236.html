<h3>Chapter 2236</h3>

<p>Ice Blue Knight King wanted to find out what had happened. He
knew someone inside the Ice Blue Knights had assisted Night River
King; otherwise, the Rebate wouldn’t have been able to sneak onto
Planet Ice Blue. But there was no evidence to implicate anyone, and
as for Edward, nothing could be done at the moment.</p>
<p>Han Sen and his team were put on call at the base. They wouldn’t
have to do any wilderness clean-up for a while.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>“That stupid Night River King! He used an Ancient Warrior
Statue, and he still couldn’t kill a few Marquises!” said an Ice
Blue Knight who looked ill.</p>
<p>“Night River King wasn’t very smart, but he wasn’t stupid,
either. There must have been a good reason for him to lose so
dramatically,” Edward said flatly. “It looks like Han Sen poses a
graver threat than I first assumed.”</p>
<p>The Ice Blue Knight frowned. “What do we do now? Ice Blue Knight
King is on high alert. It will be harder for us to move. If they
find the tablet, then all our work will have been for naught.”</p>
<p>Edward shook his head. “Don’t be such a negative Nancy. We’ve
learned that Han Sen didn’t give the item to Ice Blue Knight King
or Mister White, at least. Even if he did find the tablet, we still
have a chance to claim it.”</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>Han Sen was playing with the items he had taken from Night River
King. The most valuable trinkets were the two Moon Wheel Blades.
They were a good pair of weapons for a King to wield.</p>
<p>Han Sen didn’t need them because he already had his Ghost Teeth
Knife, but he was in no rush to sell them. So, he decided to save
them for Han Yan.</p>
<p>Little Angel, Zero, and Han Meng’er had their own weapons. They
didn’t need an extra pair of knives.</p>
<p>Night River King had also been carrying a King class shield.
Sadly, he hadn’t gotten to make use of it.</p>
<p>Those were the only King class treasures that Night River King
had with him. Perhaps he was poor, or maybe he just didn’t like
carrying his riches around on assassination missions.</p>
<p>The few Duke treasures and materials that Han Sen found were
already in storage. Han Sen was going to save them for himself and
use them to top up his Duke gene tally.</p>
<p>There was one more thing that caught Han Sen’s attention,
though, and it wasn’t a treasure.</p>
<p>Among the things he had stolen from Night River King, he found a
box that was around the size of a hand. It drew Han Sen’s attention
because the box itself had been made from a King class gene.</p>
<p>The material seemed to be horn or antler, and it was unusually
hard. But instead of being turned into a treasure itself, it had
merely been used as a storage container.</p>
<p>Strangely, there was nothing precious inside the box. There was
only a simple diary.</p>
<p>Han Sen opened the diary, and indeed, it was exactly what it
appeared to be. The diary recorded everything Night River King had
going on, even the unimportant details of his days.</p>
<p>Han Sen couldn’t believe someone like Night River King would
write entries in a diary each and every day.</p>
<p>It didn’t make much sense for the man to place a mere diary
inside such a precious box.</p>
<p>Because of this, Han Sen assumed that the diary must be special
in some way. He used his Dongxuan Aura and the Purple-Eye
Butterfly, but the outcome was disappointing.</p>
<p>It really was just a diary. The Purple-Eye let him see how it
was created, and the production was average. It didn’t even come
with a bookmark. It had been made from materials that were
extremely common in the geno universe. Even the brand that made it
was well known. Many people used their products.</p>
<p>“If the diary is really just a dairy, maybe its contents harbor
a secret?” Han Sen had difficulty believing that Night River King
would write entries in his diary every day for no special
reason.</p>
<p>Han Sen skimmed through the contents, but there was nothing
interesting. He started to doubt his own judgment.</p>
<p>“Was Night River King really a very sensitive man? Is that why
he wrote in his diary each day?” Han Sen put down the diary and
looked into the box.</p>
<p>The box was simple. It was made from a King class xenogeneic’s
material, and it had no secrets or hidden compartments. It was very
plain, not even decorated with any symbols.</p>
<p>“Brother-in-law, is that a diary that you’re reading? Is that
what you’ve been doing all day?” Ji Qing approached and smiled at
him.</p>
<p>“Mhm. I found it in Night River King’s possessions. I think
there must be something important inside, but I can’t find
anything,” Han Sen said.</p>
<p>“Let me see. Maybe I can spot something,” Ji Qing said.</p>
<p>Han Sen handed it over. Ji Qing examined the paper and binding
briefly, then turned her attention to the content of the entries. A
while later, she said, “If I’m not mistaken, he’s been writing in
code.”</p>
<p>“What sort of code?” Han Sen asked with some confusion. The
diary was written in the common language of the geno universe. He
knew every word.</p>
<p>Ji Qing pointed at one of the diary entries. “This is the common
language of the geno universe, but when you look closer, there’s a
pattern to how he writes. It’s a code of some sort. If you can look
the words up, perhaps you will find out what he’s actually
saying.”</p>
<p>“Can you break the code for me?” Han Sen asked.</p>
<p>“I only know the basics of cryptography. If I had a list of code
words, I could probably make some progress. I can’t do it without a
list, though. You should probably contact the Ji family for help
with this. We have a code-breaking team, and they are real
professionals when it comes to this stuff. They can help you.” Ji
Qing passed the notebook back to Han Sen.</p>
<p>Han Sen thought she was right. After he put the diary away, he
took the time to pop back to the sanctuary. He gave the diary to Ji
Yanran and told her about the difficulty he was having in breaking
the code.</p>
<p>After that, Han Sen went to visit his warehouse. He lifted the
egg, which was formerly the little red bird, from the keg. He then
placed it in the Undying Bird’s Nest, hoping it would hatch
soon.</p>
<p>By the time he was done in the warehouse, the Ji family had
already sent him a progress report. The patterns in the writing
didn’t fit any of the codes they had on record, so deciphering the
diary would be difficult. Fortunately, they had been researching
the geno universe’s language since Han Sen returned to the
sanctuaries for the first time. So, there was still a chance for
them to decipher the diary. It would simply take some time.</p>
<p>They asked Han Sen to return in ten days, and by then, they
might have made some progress.</p>
<p>There were many people in the base, so Han Sen knew he shouldn’t
remain in the sanctuaries for too long. He took the Undying Bird’s
Nest and the little red bird’s egg back to the base on Planet Ice
Blue.</p>
<p>Ordinary xenogeneic bird eggs took three or four hours to hatch
inside the bird’s nest, but the little red bird had been inside the
nest for an entire day. And still, it showed no response. Han Sen
wondered if the egg might have died.</p>
