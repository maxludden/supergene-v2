    <p>
      When Han Sen started to practice Jadeskin, he was too old in age. Since
      the foundation was not laid when he was a boy and he had practiced the
      hyper geno art for a short time, Han Sen was not able to make a big
      progress with it. Without the help of geno solutions, until this day, he
      still was not able to make the first breakthrough with Jadeskin.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen was stuck in a bottleneck and failed to make the breakthrough.
      However, when he drank the geno solutions to practice Micro Crystal,
      Jadeskin was activated unexpectedly and was pushed to the first
      breakthrough.
    </p>

    <p>Han Sen only had one feeling at this point.</p>

    <p>Cold! Piercing and thrilling cold!</p>

    <p>
      The cold did not come from the outside but seemed to come from within. It
      was as if every single inch of his body was giving off the coldness,
      making Han Sen feel like he was going to turn into an ice statute.
    </p>

    <p>
      He wanted to stop activation of Jadeskin, otherwise, wondered if he would
      be frozen to death. However, Jadeskin was like a wild horse that did not
      follow his control at all. The cold got worse and worse, making Han Sen
      become unconscious.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;I can&#8217;t sleep. If I fall asleep, I&#8217;m afraid I will not
      wake up ever.&#8221; Han Sen knew very well what would happen to someone
      who fell asleep in the snow, so he was striving to be lucid.
    </p>

    <p>
      However, it did not help a lot. At this point, he could not even move his
      fingers. His entire body was incredibly cold and even the temperature in
      the room fell.
    </p>

    <p>
      The thermostats did not seem to sense the drop in the room temperature, so
      it was not working.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Dammit! How come the thermostats is broken at this point. Is God
      trying to kill me?&#8221; Han Sen wanted to smash the damned machine but
      unfortunately, he could not even move.
    </p>

    <p>
      Suddenly, an idea crossed Han Sen&#8217;s mind, which made him widen his
      eyes. No way. There is no such a coincidence. The reason the thermostats
      did not change only meant the room temperature did not actually drop. The
      cold I am feeling is very likely just a hallucination rather than a
      reality.
    </p>

    <p>
      Thinking of that, Han Sen quickly gritted his teeth and told himself,
      &#8220;I&#8217;m not cold… I&#8217;m not cold… everything is fake…
      It&#8217;s just my hallucination…&#8221;
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Dammit, it&#8217;s really cold…&#8221; Han Sen felt like the
      psychological suggestion did not really work, because he was actually
      frozen to death. It felt like his heart was frozen and blood had stopped
      flowing and became ice. The coldness went to his heart.
    </p>

    <p>
      Gradually, the cold left him, and Han Sen started to feel warm. It was
      like sunshine in winter, making his trembling body feel better. Although
      it was not hot, it made him feel so comfortable that he almost moaned.
    </p>

    <p>
      However, Han Sen did not feel happy about it. He became even more worried.
      He knew that the cold did not go away. The warmth meant he was not far
      from death. As soon he was fooled by the heat and fell asleep, he would
      never wake up. When he was discovered by others, he would be a dead body.
    </p>

    <p>
      He tried his best not to fall asleep, but he felt more and more fuzzy. In
      the end, he could not help but fall asleep.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen did not know how long he had been sleeping. When he woke up again,
      he felt so comfortable as if he had just stepped out of a hot spring.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;What? I did not die?&#8221; Han Sen raised his hands incredulously
      and pinched his cheeks. Feeling the pain, he yelped.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Indeed, I did not die. This is not a dream!&#8221; Han Sen was
      overjoyed. Before he fell asleep, he thought he was doomed. However,
      nothing had really happened. It was as if he had just gone to bed.
    </p>

    <p>
      However, Han Sen felt his body was somewhat different. Although he could
      not tell what was different, the feeling could not be mistaken.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen could not wait to run Jadeskin in his body, trying to figure out
      what had happened. The moment he started, he saw his two hands had become
      transparent like ice or Jade.
    </p>

    <p>
      These hands reminded Han Sen of Xue Longyan&#8217;s hands the only time he
      met Xue Longyan. However, Han Sen&#8217;s hands were even more fine than
      Xue Longyan&#8217;s. It was hard to believe they were human hands.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;First breakthrough… I made the first breakthrough in
      Jadeskin…&#8221; Han Sen practiced Jadeskin in excitement, turning his
      entire body into Jade.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Jadeskin… This is what Jadeskin truly meant… I made it!&#8221; Han
      Sen could not resist his excitement. Watching his translucent body, he
      almost laughed out loud.
    </p>

    <p>
      After insisting on practicing Jadeskin for so long, Han Sen eventually
      made the first breakthrough, which laid the most important foundation.
    </p>

    <p>
      Although Han Sen was still a bit too old to start, the fact that he had
      made the first breakthrough with the hyper geno art made his progress fall
      into the normal range.
    </p>

    <p>
      Feeling endless power inside his body, Han Sen squeezed his fists.
      Although the muscles and bones looked translucent, they were as flexible
      as beef tendons. He did not feel hard to move around but felt his senses
      were heightened.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen stopped the running of Jadeskin and turned his body back to
      normal. Looking at himself in the mirror, he saw his skin became more
      tender and smooth. However, there was not much of a difference between now
      and then. His eyes were more watery like gemstones, which made him look
      quite charming.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;If I continue this way, I will be more and more like a
      gigolo.&#8221; Feeding upset, Han Sen hoped he could look more masculine.
    </p>

    <p>
      However, that was no big deal. There was no need to care about the
      appearance. Han Sen ran Micro Crystal again, wanting to make sure that he
      was still able to practice this hyper geno art.
    </p>

    <p>
      Very soon, Han Sen opened his mouth wide. After practicing Micro Crystal,
      he found that Micro Crystal was just a small part of Jadeskin.
    </p>

    <p>
      When he used Micro Crystal, Han Sen felt his body was toughened because
      the body cells were crystallized, making him look like a statue carved out
      of crystal.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Micro Crystal, I achieved it…&#8221; Although Han Sen felt
      incredulous, the fact was the fact. He indeed succeeded in practicing
      Micro Crystal. Hew Han Sen looked was exactly what was described in the
      Micro Crystal tutorial.
    </p>

    <p>
      The hyper geno art that took others 2 to 3 decades to practice was easily
      achieved by Han Sen. Even Han Sen himself could not believe that was
      happening.
    </p>

    <p>
      Shortly, Han Sen found that it was not really a fact worth celebrating.
      The effect of Micro Crystal was far worse than Jadeskin after he made the
      first breakthrough. The only good thing about Micro Crystal was that now
      he had an excuse to cover the fact that he had been practicing Jadeskin.
