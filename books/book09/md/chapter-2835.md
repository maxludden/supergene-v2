Han Sen felt terrible. At this time, Very High Leader's mind has reached Very High Forget Love level. If he really wants to achieve Sky and Men Combined Together, does he have to cut off all other thoughts? Will he kill the butterfly lady?

Although Han Sen knew things were not going well, he had no other choice. With God there, he couldn't stop Very High Leader.

Will I have to become a slave for a century? Han Sen's brain quickly spun. He hoped to find a chance.

The butterfly lady saw that Very High Leader was no longer looking like he was in his right mind. She sadly looked at him and said, "Are you really going to kill me?"

Very High Leader shook his head. "I have already learned the secrets of Very High Forget Love. Through the flow of time, favor, grudges, and love are not enough to leave a mark in my heart. From now on, there will be no more connection between you and me. We are just strangers. Go. The sky is big, and the ground is big. You will always find somewhere else to be in Outer Sky."

Han Sen was shocked. He thought he had underestimated Very High Leader. He now understood. He did get the secrets of Very High Sense, but at a deeper level than Han Sen presumed. He really did let go of all else. Even the butterfly lady could not keep him there.

Am I that lucky? Did I just win the bet? Han Sen did not believe God would let him win the bet that easily. He looked at God.

He saw God was still watching on with interest. It was not going to stop what was happening. It was like nothing mattered to it, and it was merely there to watch.

Han Sen tested him by asking, "Are you not going to convince him?"

"No. Everything is going according to plan. I just hope the story will not be disappointing." God was speaking to Han Sen but kept watching Very High Leader and the butterfly lady. God was like a young man watching a sad drama and was going to get emotional by simply watching.

Han Sen saw God was looking like he was not going to do anything, but he thought he would win. So, he looked at Very High Leader and the butterfly lady. He tried to find out why God was feeling so confident.

Very High Leader did not want to kill. He treated the butterfly lady like a stranger. He said what he had to and got ready to leave.

Suddenly, the butterfly lady laughed very loudly. That laugh was very spiking to the eardrums. Han Sen felt itchy by just hearing her. His skin flared with a bevy of goosebumps.

Seeing the butterfly lady spread her wings, she looked into the sky and laughed sharply. The substance chains on her were like countless butterfly shadows. They surrounded her. It was like a butterfly of death coming at them from the underworld.

"Are you leaving Just like that?" The butterfly lady ceased smiling. Her eyes had a scary light. She was confronting Very High Leader.

"You should learn to let go and move on," Very High Leader coldly said. His heart did not seem to contain the compassion it once did. No matter what the butterfly lady did, she could not make him feel anything.

The butterfly lady pointed at Very High Leader and shouted, "You said it like it was so easy! Have you spared a moment to think about me? Those of the Love Butterfly mate for life. If we get abandoned by our spouse, we have to die alone. If you just dump me like this, what is the difference between that and killing me?"

Han Sen finally understood why God was feeling so confident. God's target from the very beginning was not Very High Leader. It was the butterfly lady.

Han Sen thought about how things had been developing. The butterfly lady had been forced to this level. She was a part of everything that was going on.

My practice really was not enough. I have been tricked by God ever since the beginning. I never did one-up over God's plans. Han Sen knew that he had sorely lost this time.

But the butterfly lady was still alive. There was still a chance for him to turn the tables. Although it would be difficult, a chance was a chance.

"Sorry," Very High Leader coldly said.

His apology made the butterfly lady even more enraged. The butterfly lady screeched and asked, "If I am dying anyway, why should I die alone? I should have you die with me. Let's see how you will truly leave me."

The butterfly lady's face looked crazy. Her butterfly shadow was like the shadow of a reaper's scythe headed for Very High Leader.

The butterfly-class butterfly lady was powerful. Although Very High Leader had learned Very High Sense's secrets, his power was still primitive. He couldn't fight against the butterfly-class butterfly lady. It was just a reflection, but Very High Leader's body had been dealt with many cuts that were scary to see. They were given by the butterfly shadow. God blood came out of his wounds.

"If Very High Leader is murdered, does that mean you lose?" Han Sen asked God.

"Yes," God nodded and continued looking at Very High Leader and butterfly lady fighting with interest.

"Then, aren't you going to save him?" Han Sen attempted asking. He wanted to know what God was currently calculating to see Very High Leader be able to kill the butterfly lady.

"There is no need," God coldly said. "Life and death should just be let be. I have done my part. The choices made are now theirs to create."

Han Sen couldn't find out anything. He looked at the battleground, thinking about how Very High Leader was going to defeat the butterfly lady.

No matter how he viewed matters, the butterfly lady was suppressing Very High Leader. He wasn't standing a chance.

The butterfly lady's power was very unique. She was not like an ordinary xenogeneic. Her powers contained death elements and emotional elements, and her geno arts were also very weird. Even if Han Sen fought her, he was not sure if he would be able to kill her.

Very High Leader was only 20 years and had just become primitive. He couldn't defeat the butterfly lady. He might have ended up being killed by the butterfly lady.

Many butterfly shadows riddled Very High Leader's body with lesions. Even when using Very High Sense at its best, he was unable to block the butterfly lady's power.

Very High Leader tried teleporting. When he teleported, his body was hit by the butterfly shadow. He dropped out of teleporting.

The butterfly shadows that kept appearing and disappearing were like the death butterflies everywhere harvesting lives. They were surrounding Very High Leader, and they kept cutting up his body.

Pang!

Very High Leader's body hit a branch of the star tree. God blood spilled from out of his mouth. The god blood that had been bleeding dyed his armor red.

He was half-sitting and half-leaning against the star tree. Very High Leader looked as if he was dying.

"Now, come back to me, and I might still let you live. I can spare your life." The butterfly lady was in front of the Very High Leader. Death butterflies surrounded her. They were creating a weird butterfly path that led to the underworld. If Very High Leader said no, it seemed as if Very High Leader would go to that underworld that no life could enter.

"I have already told you that you and I are mere strangers now," Very High Leader said while wiping the blood from his mouth. He spoke coldly while sitting against the star tree.

"Then, you and I should die together." The butterfly lady moved her body. The death butterflies were everywhere. They were going to the Very High Leader, who could no longer battle.
