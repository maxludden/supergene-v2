<h2>Pulling Out a Sword</h2>
<h3>Chapter 3196</h3>

<p>“Mister Crown Prince, let’s summon a gene race to protect your
body before you draw the sword of your choice.” Thousand Mile Reach
and Jia Shi Zhen did not delay. One went left, and one went right.
They followed Qin Bai, ready to save him the moment he needed to be
saved.</p>
<p>“There is no need.” Qin Bai walked up to the big sword. He
reached his hand out to touch the sword’s grip, but it was too
high. After he touched the handle, he could not use any
strength.</p>
<p>Seeing that the big great sword had a blunted blade, Qin Bai
used his body to hold the sword and pull it.</p>
<p>The scared Thousand Mile Reach and Jia Shi Zhen knew that with
this kind of pulling, assuming the great sword did not approve of
Qin Bai, it would attack Qin Bai’s body. He would not be given any
time to react.</p>
<p>The two of them wanted to stop that from happening, but Qin Bai
had already pulled the diamond great sword out. Suddenly, there was
a buzzing sound. The great sword exploded with a sharp sword light.
It broke Qin Bai’s armor, dying his armor with blood.</p>
<p>Jia Shi Zhen’s reactions were blisteringly quick. She fired out
a lightning-like sword light to send the great sword flying
away.</p>
<p>Thousand Mile Reach flew and grabbed Qin Bai. He immediately
examined Qin Bai’s wounds. Fortunately, Jia Shi Zhen’s reactions
had been fast enough. Before the great sword could strike Qin Bai’s
ribcage, it had only damaged his skin.</p>
<p>Jia Shi Zhen unleashed another sword light to cut the diamond
great sword in half. After the diamond great sword was broken, it
self-destructed. It turned into a mushroom cloud until it fizzed
away into dust.</p>
<p>If Jia Shi Zhen had hit the great sword while Qin Bai was
holding it, it would have blown Qin Bai into dust.</p>
<p>Qin Bai’s eyes were open wide. He looked at his chest, which was
bleeding profusely. He only now realized what had happened. He felt
pain and said, “Ow… It is hurting like hell…”</p>
<p>Qin Bai had never felt pain this severe before. It made his eyes
bring on the waterworks, which also made his nose snotty. Thousand
Mile Reach summoned a healing power gene race to heal Qin Bai.
“Mister Crown Prince, it is only a small wound. There is no need
for you to shout this much.” Han Sen squatted down next to Qin Bai
and heartily laughed. “You are not the one who is hurting, so, of
course, you don’t feel hurt,” Qin Bai responded through the wails
and tears.</p>
<p>Han Sen laughed but did not reply. The wounds he had incurred
were far worse than the likes Bai Qin had ever seen before. These
wounds were nothing.</p>
<p>Han Sen could not tell Bao Qin something like that. He smiled at
him and said, “Right, if it was me, I would not touch the swords
randomly either. I would not go and collect any without first
getting a gene race. Mister Crown Prince, you are way too brave.”
“You… You… You are saying things to mock me,” Qin Bai madly
said.</p>
<p>Han Sen laughed. Bao’er added, “You are brave, but you are also
weak. You cannot even conquer a sword. You are a weak ass.”</p>
<p>“Who said I cannot do it? I just missed. That’s all.” Qin Bai
was annoyed as he spoke. He wanted to get angry, but it was Bao’er
who was talking. So, he made himself sound weaker again.</p>
<p>“You missed, huh? In that case, pick up a few more and let me
see your true might.” Bao’er looked at Qin Bai with interest.</p>
<p>Qin Bai was a little bit scared, but he liked having a bit of a
reputation. Thus, he shouted, “I am not afraid of you!” Bao’er
would not let him go. She laughed and said, “Sure. In that case,
you go right ahead and pick another one up. I bet you will end up
peeing your pants.”</p>
<p>The wounds on Qin Bai’s body had already been healed by Thousand
Mile Reach. Hearing Bao’er say what she did, Qin Bai could not help
but say, “Hmph. Watch your tongue, Bao’er. I am going to show you
how I pick one up.” Thousand Mile Reach looked at Han Sen, hoping
he would stop this contest. Han Sen behaved as if nothing was going
on. He was merely talking with Jian Bu Gu.</p>
<p>Qin Bai said he was so powerful, but he did not move his feet.
He peered at Han Sen with a beggar-like look. He quickly noticed
that Han Sen was not even looking at him. He was just talking to
Jian Bu Gu.</p>
<p>“What is it? Do you really not dare to try?” Bao’er asked as she
lifted her lips.</p>
<p>“There is nothing I would not dare to do,” Qin Bai said. He
gnashed his teeth and started looking around. He went off in the
direction of a little stick. It was bronze and looked very small
and thin.</p>
<p>Because of what happened last time, Qin Bai did not go and
select a weapon that looked so mighty. That bronze stick looked
safer. He wagered the damage it might deal would not be so
high.</p>
<p>After what happened last time, Qin Bai summoned the strongest
gene race he had at first. After he combined with it, he went to
the bronze stick.</p>
<p>He had a lot of god-class gene races to combine with, but his
power was limited. Since he had always skimped on his practices, he
could only combine with one gene race. He could not combine with
many.</p>
<p>He carefully walked to the bronze stick. He cautiously generated
the power of the gene race and enabled the gold light to protect
his body and hands. Qin Bai then used power to</p>
<p>pull.</p>
<p>He pulled out the bronze stick, but his hands were trembling. It
was like the blade was trying to struggle to break free from his
hands.</p>
<p>Qin Bai held it tight as he shouted, “You are mine!”</p>
<p>The bronze stick was incapable of escaping. It eventually
decided to self-destruct. Its power was not as strong as the gene
race Qin Bai had, but the explosion released a strong power that
blew Qin Bai backward and onto the ground. He was not injured, but
his hands felt numb.</p>
<p>“You are too weak,” Bao’er said with a shake of her head and a
lengthy sigh. “You cannot even conquer a short, broken, bronze
stick.” Qin Bai’s face turned red. He did not say a word. He
climbed to his feet and marched straight toward another weapon.</p>
<p>He noticed that with the protection of a god-class gene race,
the weapons were not all that scary. They just made him hurt a
little. He was able to endure the pain.</p>
<p>Qin Bai’s luck was not so fortunate. He pulled out seven
weapons. None of them approved him to be their master. They all
self-destructed.</p>
<p>It was lucky he was Qin Bai, the crown prince of the Qin
Kingdom. He had gene races with immense power. The explosions of
normal weapons could not hurt him.</p>
<p>Eventually, hits like these stacked up. Qin Bai was no longer
able to accept them.</p>
<p>He felt very depressed and thought, “Bao’er managed to easily
pull them out. So many emerald short swords approved her. I have
pulled out so many, so why have I yet found one that approves me?
Am I really that useless?”</p>
<p>“Han Sen, am I really useless? Why do the weapons not approve of
me as their master?” Qin Bai started to doubt his life.</p>
<p>Thousand Mile Reach and Jia Shi Zhen both sighed. The heart of
an item was like the heart of a person. Qin Bai always loved to
goof around, so he had yet to be stabilized. There was no way the
weapons were going to approve of him.</p>
<p>Han Sen laughed. “Crown Prince, you just haven’t found a way to
use them correctly yet. If you use the right method, getting the
approval of one of those weapons is not difficult.”</p>
<p>Qin Bai’s face turned bright as he said, “I see. What kind of
method do you need?”</p>
<p>“Bao’er, give your wooden sword to the crown prince to use,” Han
Sen said to Bao’er.</p>
<p>Bao’er drew the small wooden sword and passed it to Qin Bai. Han
Sen then said, “Hold this sword and try to pull out the weapon from
that side.”</p>
<p>Qin Bai was feeling rather hopeful as he held the wooden sword.
He walked to the weapon Han Sen had pointed at. It was another
diamond great sword.</p>
<p>“Can I really do this?” Qin Bai did not believe it. He looked at
Han Sen.</p>
<p>“Why not just give it a go?” Han Sen asked with a smile.</p>
<p>Qin Bai gnashed his teeth. He used gene race power to protect
his body. He grabbed the great sword and gave it a big yank. The
diamond great sword was pulled free.</p>
<p>This time, the diamond great sword did not attack him. He
managed to hold it flawlessly. It released a god light. It made Qin
Bai very shocked and happy. “I really did it!”</p>
