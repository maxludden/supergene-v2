While everyone’s emotions were in the realm of weirdness, something strange happened. A vortex appeared in the sea of fire. A lot of fire went into the vortex.

Everyone was quickly able to see Han Sen’s holy body manifest inside the swirl. It was a bit different from what they previously believed.

Han Sen had not been melted by the flame power. Instead, he had become very strange. The outside of his body was covered with an ice-crystal shield, but the ice-crystal shield had turned into a weird, screw-shaped thing that looked like a sea conch hooking outside Han Sen’s body.

The crazy fire went inside the sea conch shield. It followed the sea conch’s shape like a screw going inside. It looked like many fire dragons were surrounding Han Sen’s body and dancing strangely.

The fire power kept going in. It made the fire vortex in the shield go faster. The fire was restricted in the movement and controlled by the ice-jade power. Its mass was going to be suppressed. It created a weird vortex. It could not get close to Han Sen’s body.

“Let’s see just how much you can endure.” After witnessing this scene, Tail Fire Beast did not stop. It coldly laughed and made the fire rage at Han Sen with even greater ferocity.

The Burning Red Sky lacked everything but fire. It was going to break Han Sen’s sea conch shell shield.

The transparent sea conch shield was hit with more fire. The whole sea conch turned red like a sculpture made out of red crystal. The fire inside was red and burning. The flames looked white and gold. It made the people spectating start to worry. They thought the shield might be melted by the fire.

Yet, Han Sen’s face remained as still and stoic as ever. His situation appeared dangerous, but it was not as dangerous as others might have imagined.

He used the white sheep fairy’s hollow structure to separate a few pipelines in the sea conch’s shell. It looked like there was only one fire inside it. In fact, it was separated into many different paths of fire. The self-impact power was used to suppress it all during the process.

Of course, that was just the first step. Han Sen ultimately did not want to control the fire.

When the whole sea conch shell turned purple and white, Han Sen’s eyes blazed with a cold light. He reached out his fingers. The sea conch shell rose up and became smaller in space. It turned into a marble-sized sea conch shell in Han Sen’s hands.

There was a very strong sense of suppression in that mini sea conch fire. Han Sen looked at Tail Fire Beast and put the sea conch between his thumb and middle finger. He flicked it at Tail Fire Beast.

Tail Fire Beast felt the scary flame power inside the sea conch, but it was not afraid. It coldly laughed and asked, “Do you want to use this power to beat me? You must be far too naive to believe that is possible. Even if you put your flame power into it at its max, as long as it is fire power, it will obey me. No matter how strong it is, it will not hurt me. What you have done has only helped me. It is also enough to kill you.”

After that, Tail Fire Beast shot out another scary fire. He was going to break the sea conch and release the undying suppression fire inside. He was going to use that fire to burn Han Sen.

“It is scary to be ignorant. What a dumb fool with just limbs and power.” Han Sen coldly looked at Tail Fire Beast but did not do anything.

Pang!

The fire arrow struck the sea conch. The fire arrow’s power worked with the fire inside from the outside. The sea conch suddenly cracked. The purple-white fire flowed out of it, burying everything around. Han Sen and Tail Fire Beast were drenched in the fire.

“Humans are so naïve,” a scary Break World beast said with a great look of disdain for the exhibit. “He wants to use suppressive fire to kill Tail Fire Beast. Does he not know the Burning Red Sky’s leader Tail Fire Beast is a fire god? No fire can hurt him.”

Many powerful creatures thought Han Sen had used the wrong skill as well. Against the Burning Red Sky’s leader, fire was useless.

Suppressing fire was not stable. It suddenly released a scary power, which quickly vanished.

When the purple and white fire was suppressed, everyone was able to see what was happening on the battleground.

Han Sen was still safe standing on the ground and holding Bao’er. There was a sea conch shield outside of his body. It guided the fire to spin inside it. It reduced half of the explosive impact.

While it was in the air, Tail Fire Beast was riddled with several holes. The lava-like blood of the beast was gushing out. Its eyes were rendered into smoky holes.

“How was that possible?” Many scary creatures looked on in disbelief.

Tang Zhenliu lost his voice as he laughed and said, “Ah, typical. It really does appear as if those dumb Break World beasts have a really low level of intelligence. Do they not know anything? Do they not understand what bullet theory is? The real deadly fire is not the energy of its explosion. It is the substances that are pushed by energy.”

Tail Fire Beast was bleeding lots of blood that looked like lava. It roared, wanting to stir up another incendiary storm. As it roared, its body collapsed. Blood came gushing out of every orifice in its body. It was like countless amounts of volcanoes were all erupting at the same time.

*Boom!* *Boom!*

Tail Fire Beast’s giant body fell. It fell into a hot lava sea and sank into it.

As many scary creatures were watching this in shock, a light flew out of the lava and came before Han Sen. It was a mysterious spell. It was the mark that had been on Tail Fire Beast’s forehead moments before. It represented the Burning Red Sky’s will. It was the sky leader’s mark.

Now that it was appearing in front of Han Sen, everyone understood what was happening. Han Sen had replaced Tail Fire Beast to become a new owner of Burning Red Sky.

> “Break World Beast Hunted: Ultimate Tail Fire Beast. Found Break World Gene.”

An announcement sounded in Han Sen’s brain.

Han Sen looked at the sky leader’s mark. He raised his hand and let the mark appear in his palm. The mark blended into his skin.

When this was all done, the fires of Burning Red Sky went mad. They did not seek to hurt Han Sen though. It was like the sky and the ground were releasing fireworks in praise. It was as if they were celebrating the birth of a new fire leader.

The geno tablet’s video stream ended there. There was a new ranking on the leader leaderboard. The names on the 15th sky were still glowing. However, Tail Fire Beast’s name was no longer there.

> Fifteenth Sky Leader: Han Sen

That line of words shone in the main and reverse universes. It drew the attention of many creatures. All the races in the geno universe were happy.

Finally, a creature from the geno universe had obtained the seat of a leader. It was also done by slaying another leader. The geno universe’s creatures were all very happy about this.

“What a scary man. He only has a Break World rate of 60%, and he only used a simple skill to easily kill Tail Fire Beast.” Many Break World beasts felt conflicted about this.

Han Sen’s fight gave many weak Break World beasts see the hope of being weaker yet still being able to topple the strong. They also knew that they could not outright do it as Han Sen had.
