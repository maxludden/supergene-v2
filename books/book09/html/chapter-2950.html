<p>“So, are you guys revolting?” Nine Thousand King’s expression
changed.</p>
<p>The demon lady, Auntie Mei, laughed at Han Sen. “You are Little
Master’s father. You are a guest here. You are a guest in Sacred,
but the holy spirit is very important. It is an item for your son.
I am sure you would not want to steal what belongs to your son,
would you? I hope you are willing to return the holy spirit.”</p>
<p>“I can return the holy spirit,” Han Sen coldly said. “Give me
Littleflower, and I will hand it over.”</p>
<p>“Littleflower is not in Sacred right now,” Auntie Mei said.
“Just give me the holy spirit and it will be fine.”</p>
<p>“In that case, I will wait for him to come back,” Han Sen
replied.</p>
<p>“If he was going to deliver it to anyone, it would be the Little
Master!” Nine Thousand King shouted from his nearby position. “Why
would he give it to you guys? Hurry up and lead the way. Allow
Mister Han to wait in the holy palace for Little Master’s
return.”</p>
<p>“He cannot enter the holy palace,” Red Ghost coldly said.</p>
<p>“Why can’t he enter the holy palace?” Nine Thousand King asked.
“He is Little Master’s real father. Why can he not enter the holy
palace?”</p>
<p>Red Ghost stared at Nine Thousand King and grumpily said, “Stop
shouting. Butterflies develop from caterpillars. Butterflies can
fly. Can caterpillars fly?”</p>
<p>“What is that supposed to mean?” Nine Thousand King was
furious.</p>
<p>“It means exactly what I said. Give me the holy spirit and get
the hell out! When Little Master needs it, he will go and look for
it.” Red Ghost and Nine Thousand King stared at each other. They
were like fighting cocks.</p>
<p>“How dare you ignore Mister Han! He was told to come to the holy
palace by the leader. Why are you disobeying his order?” Nine
Thousand King was so angry that he was shaking.</p>
<p>“Do you think I am going to believe what you tell me?” Red Ghost
asked with disdain.</p>
<p>Nine Thousand King wanted to say something, but the demon lady
interrupted him. “Thousand Eye, Sacred Hall is a different place.
That is the last hope of Sacred. Only Little Master can go inside.
No one else can go inside, including people like us. If you want to
do a good deed for Sacred, you should at least understand
that.”</p>
<p>After pausing, Auntie Mei said to Han Sen. “Old Cat must have
told you the situation regarding Little Master. With us taking care
of him, he is in good care. He is not in danger. You do not have to
worry about that. Right now, Little Master is going to be deified.
Not long after, he can build Sacred up again. Then, the Sacred door
will open, and you can come and see him and become a full-time
guest of Sacred.”</p>
<p>“Regarding the holy spirit, that is the item Little Master needs
to liberate Sacred. Otherwise, when Sacred re-opens, harm will come
to Little Master. You are Little Master’s father. You would not
want to see Little Master be harmed, would you?” The demon lady
flicked her hair. She squinted her eyes and went on to say, “I have
told you this much because you are the father of Little Master. We
would have killed you and taken the holy spirit back with ease if
you weren’t. We would not waste so much time talking crap if you
were anybody else. We respect you because you are Little Master’s
father. I hope you can understand this.”</p>
<p>“What does re-opening Sacred entail? What kind of danger will
Littleflower have?” Han Sen frowned and looked at Auntie Mei.</p>
<p>“That is Sacred business!” Old Vulture screamed. “Don’t you
worry about it.”</p>
<p>Han Sen’s expression was gloomy. “Sacred business? Littleflower
is my son. Are you saying things about my son are none of my
business?”</p>
<p>“Kid, do not make us go hard on you. If you make us fight you
for the holy spirit, we will not even care about you being Little
Master’s father.” Red Ghost’s body was moving. He was like a big
beast that could swallow the sky. He was oppressing Han Sen.</p>
<p>Han Sen’s personality was very stubborn. He only took things
softly. He didn’t take them hard. Besides, this affected the safety
of Littleflower. He was not willing to fall back now.</p>
<p>“I am afraid you do not have what it takes,” Han Sen coldly
said. He drew his cause karma knife. He held the Shield of the
Medusa’s Gaze in his other hand.</p>
<p>Although the holy spirit and beast soul had different names,
they were the same thing. If he was not able to use force and take
the beast soul, the holy spirit would be the same. If the master
died, the holy spirit would be gone. Han Sen did not think they
could take the holy spirit out of him without killing him.</p>
<p>If they were able to just take it, the demon lady would have
already attacked. She would not have spent so much time talking to
him.</p>
<p>“What do you want?” Red Ghost, Old Vulture, and the other’s had
dark expressions. They did not expect Han Sen to become so
hostile.</p>
<p>In the Sacred era, they had been invincible existences. Not many
people were able to fight them. In this era, they were stronger
than ever with their titles.</p>
<p>Even powerful people like Sky Palace’s first seat, who was the
best in the universe, had been trapped by the eyeless big
beast.</p>
<p>Han Sen was just a creature from the sanctuaries. He was only
butterfly class, yet he dared to raise his voice against them. They
did not think something like that could happen.</p>
<p>“What about it?” Han Sen looked calm. He looked past Old Vulture
into the darkness.</p>
<p>Han Sen was looking toward where Red Ghost had come from. If
that was true, that was where the holy palace resided.</p>
<p>“I do not care what this place is. I do not care about who you
people are. I do not care about reopening Sacred. I do not care
about shining the whole world. In my eyes, it is all shit. If
something harms my Littleflower, come hell or high water, I will
tear it up.”</p>
<p>After Han Sen said that, he passed the stone lantern to Bao’er
and said, “Bao’er, hold the lantern for Dad. We are going to tear
up this lame, holy palace. It has already fallen once. Let it
forever remain inside a history book.”</p>
<p>Bao’er sat on Han Sen’s shoulder. She held the stone lantern and
shouted with excitement, “Tear it down!”</p>
<p>“You do not have what it takes.” Red Ghost grunted with obvious
disdain.</p>
<p>The demon lady looked at the stone lantern. She was shocked and
asked, “Why is Sacred’s race lantern in your hand?”</p>
<p>“What? Race lantern?” Red Ghost, Old Vulture, and the eyeless
beast were shocked. They looked at the stone lantern in Bao’er’s
hand.</p>
<p>They were shocked to see it. Red Ghost screamed, “Race lantern…
It really is Sacred’s race lantern! How could he have it?”</p>
<p>“The Sacred lantern is still here, so… Does that mean…” Old
Vulture was so excited that he was trembling.</p>
<p>Han Sen heard what Old Vulture said. He felt strange about why
Sacred’s race lantern was not inside the geno hall but was instead
inside the universe. Han Sen was not able to care too much about
that fact just yet. He jumped up and raced into the darkness in the
direction of the palace.</p>
<p>“I do not care about some f*cking Sacred Leader or some race
lantern. Whatever hurts my son is going to be broken.” Han Sen was
very angry. He cast Blood-Pulse Sutra and Jadeskin to the max. It
made his body become ice jade. His skin was half-transparent, and
it was glowing.</p>
