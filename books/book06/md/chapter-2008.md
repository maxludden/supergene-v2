  Dong!

After delivering a slash to the Stone Cow’s body, Han Sen fell back and became petrified. Within a second, Han Sen had removed the petrification and moved forward to strike the Stone Cow again.

After a few repetitions of this, Han Sen’s blade had left multiple marks on the Stone Cow’s body. The purple Teeth powers were spreading.

There was no use in the Stone Cow crying aloud anymore, as the smaller Stone Cows were too far away. They wouldn’t hear the squeals.

Han Sen and the Stone Cow kept fighting over the next thirty hours. Stone Cow’s body was finally unable to withstand its wounds, and it was torn apart by the Teeth powers. It was reduced to nothing but shattered bits of rock.

> “Mutant Xenogeneic Marquise killed. Petrified Demon Cow: mutant xenogeneic gene found. Obtained mutant xenogeneic beast soul.”

The announcement played in Han Sen’s head, and he smiled.

He rushed over to the shattered rock and began picking through the rubble. Stone Cow’s body was made of stone, and so it had no flesh. After a while, however, he found its special stone heart. There was a light inside it, and it reminded him of the itself.

“After refining this mutant xenogeneic gene, will I learn how to petrify others?” Han Sen was really interested in the stone cow’s ability. Learning the ability to petrify other xenogeneics with a stomp would be fairly great.

But the bad thing about all this was that the  was a Marquise mutant xenogeneic. To refine it, he’d have to be a Marquise himself, with a number of Marquise genes stockpiled.

Han Sen was interested in the xenogeneic’s beast soul, too, though. He took a look at it.

A wide grin spread across Han Sen’s face. He could now turn himself into the . He wondered if it would give him all the physical capabilities of the . That would be a great boost for his strength, if so.

Han Sen immediately used the shapeshift  beast soul. When he summoned it, he turned into the . He felt as if his power and speed increased — the power in particular. There was a big increase in that.

But sadly, Han Sen’s shapeshifting beast soul only gave him the raw strength of the creature. He didn’t earn the ability to petrify others or reverse negative effects onto others.

“It looks like I’ll just have to hold out for the stone cow’s mutant gene.” Han Sen put away the shapeshifting and continued his search for xenogeneics.

Sky Palace was entertaining some beautiful guests.

The men were strong, and the women were lovely. They had gorgeous white wings, and they were the Feather from Holy Heaven.

Soon, the news spread across the entire geno universe. The Feather had sided with Sky Palace, and they had become a subordinate race of the Sky.

The Kings of the Feather had allowed their heirs to come and practice in Sky Palace.

They were there to learn powerful geno arts to secure and protect future generations. The young Feathers also served as hostages in some ways, in that they would put themselves at the mercy of the Sky to prove the Feathers’ overall loyalty to Sky Palace.

“Angia, will we live here from now on? We cannot return to Holy Heaven?” A beautiful Feather lady asked a Feather man who looked like Apollo.

The other children of the Feather Kings all looked towards that man, as well. It seemed as if he was their leader.

“No, we will return to Holy Heaven one day, and Holy Heaven will be the home of a high race once more. Until then, we have to earn the respect and the approval of the Sky race.” Angia smiled at the girl.

“How do we earn their respect and approval? Before we became a low race, we were so much inferior to the Sky already. Now we are actually a low race…” The lady was worried.

“No high race was born a high race. You only need to be strong to earn the respect and approval of others. It’s like that everywhere,” Angia pronounced.

A strong male Feather stood up and said, “Angia, tell us what to do.”

“Be patient. Learn and perform. Make us strong again. Let them see that we are worthy.” Angia paused, then went on to say, “The Sky are powerful. Amongst the higher races, they are the most accepting of outsiders. They are very unlike the Buddha, who treat outsiders like tools for their own purpose. That is why we refused the Buddha’s offer and came here instead. Here, we might become students of Sky Palace, as much as the Sky themselves are. Many outsiders have become members of this place. And we need strength.”

“Do not worry. We will keep practicing. One day, the Feathers will become a high race again,” the strong male Feather swore.

The other Feathers agreed, too. But few of them looked very hopeful.

Becoming a high race was difficult. If the Feather had no deified elites, then they couldn’t become one of the high races again.

Aside from the Feather Alpha, the strongest Feather was only half-deified. None of them were fully deified yet. And now that they were a lower race, achieving deified status for one of their members would be even more difficult.

“Just fighting is not enough,” Angia said grimly. “We are only commoners here. We do not have the benefits, and we cannot yet learn powerful geno arts. We need to impress the elders and the leader so that we can become official students. Only then will we stand a chance.”

“Then what do we do?” A lady Feather looked at Angia.

“The exams would be our best opportunity, but this year’s exams are already done.” Angia sighed.

“That means we will have to wait until next year,” a male Feather said, looking quite sad.

“Perhaps not. We’ll do well if we can beat one person. Do that, and we’ll instantly become famous in Sky Palace. We will garner the attention of the elders and the leader.” Angia’s eyes looked sharp.

“Who?” the young Feathers asked together.

“That crystallizer Kong Fei gifted a deified feather to. Knife Queen’s student,” Angia said calmly. “He earned first place in the exam for Earl class and fought Lone Bamboo to a draw. Lone Bamboo is legendary amongst the Sky. If we beat the crystallizer, we will earn the approval we need.”

“That guy! One of Kong Fei’s people? He should die!” the strong Feather man said.

“Shut up. No matter what he was before, now he is a student of Sky Palace. We should not talk like that,” Angia scolded him.

The Feather respected Angia, so he lowered his head and stopped talking.

“But he was chosen by that traitor Kong Fei. We do not need to go easy on him or anything,” Angia said icily.
