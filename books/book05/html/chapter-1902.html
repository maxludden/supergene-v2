<h2>Buddha Touching a Flower</h2>
<h3>Chapter 1902</h3>

<p>Han Sen stood in front of the testing gold rock, and his mind
moved quickly.</p>
<p>No Flower’s Touching Flower Finger mind was not a King class
display, but to young Nobles, it certainly seemed that strong.</p>
<p>Teeth Knife’s knifemind was stronger than No Flower’s, but Han
Sen could not use it. If he used all of his power, then he could
definitely triumph. But Yisha would become suspicious of him.</p>
<p>Even if he didn’t use Teeth Knife knifemind, Han Sen’s own sword
mind was not weak, either. He could easily defeat No Flower with
that, too, but it was something Yisha had already seen before. If
Han Sen used it, he’d expose the fact he was Dollar to her, and it
was highly likely Yisha wouldn’t let him go after that.</p>
<p>Fortunately, Han Sen had an alternate plan. Unlimited Sutra had
a record of Touching Flower Finger. Although Han Sen had not
practiced it yet, he knew what sort of geno art it was.</p>
<p>Every Buddha knew Touching Flower Finger, and that proved to him
it wasn’t a difficult geno art to get to grips with.</p>
<p>No Flower’s version was so strong because he had been gifted the
strength of Wilted’s mind.</p>
<p>“Ancient Devil, it is just as you have said. Show me your power
and be sincere about it.” Han Sen placed his will inside Destiny’s
Tower. He spoke to Ancient Devil.</p>
<p>Ancient Devil smiled and said, “As you wish.”</p>
<p>After that, Ancient Devil remained where he sat. He raised up
his finger to draw.</p>
<p>Ancient Devil was now using Buddha’s Touching Flower Finger. It
was different from No Flower’s Touching Flower Finger, which had
been altered with Wilted’s mind. When Ancient Devil brought out his
finger, it was like a Buddha touching a flower. Everything in the
world was inside that finger.</p>
<p>When Ancient Devil drew, Han Sen felt his heart connect to him.
Han Sen could feel what he felt, and see what he saw.</p>
<p>Han Sen was in sync with Ancient Devil. He brought out his
finger and pressed it against the testing gold rock. The movement
of the two was perfectly synchronized.</p>
<p>But Ancient Devil was drawing in the air, as Han Sen’s finger
ran across the surface of the stone.</p>
<p>“Hey! It’s Touching Flower Finger. Han Sen is using Touching
Flower Finger?”</p>
<p>“It looks that way, but why does he possess the Buddha’s
Touching Flower Finger?”</p>
<p>“Touching Flower Finger is not rare, and it is common amongst
the Buddha. Many outsiders know how to use it, too, so it’s nothing
too surprising. It surely is strange to see him want to copy and
write it down, too, immediately after.”</p>
<p>“One flower. One leaf. One world.” Han Sen did not pay heed to
what others said about him.</p>
<p>Boom!</p>
<p>When the Nobles saw what Han Sen had written, they fell into a
stunned silence. Quickly, a cold sweat developed across all their
bodies. They were so scared, it was like a curse had been laid upon
them. They didn’t move, and all they could do was solemnly stare at
Han Sen’s written word.</p>
<p>There were no petals, falling like No Flower’s. And there was no
threat of death or wilting, either.</p>
<p>Even so, everyone felt scared, witnessing what Han Sen had
written. It zapped into the deepest recesses of their minds and
latched on to them.</p>
<p>Seeing those words was like watching a Buddha stroking flowers
without talking. It was like he could see through everything.</p>
<p>He was smiling as he went, but the smile was worse than the
devil’s.</p>
<p>At least the devil would lure creatures to fall with him, but
this Buddha went straight for the darker side of your heart. They
couldn’t hide anything. It was like their ugliest, filthiest, and
evilest sides were being exposed for all to see.</p>
<p>Facing death required courage. If they fought and failed, their
could at least close their eyes and be at peace. But in front of
that Touching Flower Buddha, they didn’t have the strength to face
it. They felt nasty. They felt as if they were muddied with
sin.</p>
<p>“Argh!” One of the young Nobles, with a weak will, started
screaming with his eyes closed. It was like he was running from
something.</p>
<p>The Dukes and Marquise were all pale.</p>
<p>Night River King looked at Han Sen, and he too seemed very
glum.</p>
<p>Including Clear Sea Buddha, all the Buddhas were in utter shock.
None of them could summon the strength to say a word.</p>
<p>“Blergh!” A young Noble pulled out his knife and drove it into
his own heart. He couldn’t withstand the pressure, and so he
decided to kill himself.</p>
<p>“I didn’t kill you! I didn’t steal it! I didn’t do it!” More
young people started to scream and run, erupting into a frenzy of
madmen. They all kept on talking nonsense.</p>
<p>“Amitabha! Mister Han, please stop! No Flower has lost!” Clear
Sea Buddha said the Buddha catchphrase, and the young Nobles woke
up from the trance of that flower mind. They all looked pale, as if
they had just awoken from the most horrible, lucid nightmare.</p>
<p>Han Sen stopped moving his finger, and he pulled it back slowly.
He had only written half of it.</p>
<p>No one could face that fear.</p>
<p>“A Buddha truly touching the flower is pierced and reflected on
people’s minds, yielding only fear. One thought to be a Buddha, and
one thought to be a Demon. It is hard to understand that, and
Mister Han can practice Touching Flower Finger to this level? The
Buddhas can only be ashamed of themselves. Where did you learn
this?” Clear Sea Buddha looked at Han Sen with massive shock. He
tried to ask as politely as he could, but he had trouble
suppressing the shock.</p>
<p>Many people practiced Touching Flower Finger, but very few
established a connection with its true meaning.</p>
<p>No Flower had associated it with wilting, but Han Sen had
actually shown the real meaning right here. Ever since the Buddhas
had created that technique, fewer than five people had ever
achieved what had just been performed.</p>
<p>Han Sen was a Baron and not a Buddha, and yet he could practice
Touching Flower Finger to that extent. It was all so difficult to
imagine.</p>
<p>“It is a simple finger art, and No Flower explained it well
enough. So, I guess I have just learned it. It didn’t feel all too
smooth, so I added a few modifications of my own. I apologize if I
did not write it down well.” Han Sen smiled.</p>
<p>After Han Sen said that, the Buddha stared at him in silence.
The Nobles of Narrow Moon almost choked.</p>
<p>“So, he learned some… He modified it… And he says he did not
write it down well…”</p>
<p>All the Nobles felt as if their lives had been wasted. They did
not know geno arts could be practiced like that.</p>
<p>Yisha and Moon Wheel King looked at Han Sen strangely. Clear Sea
King looked shocked. After a while, he said the Buddha catchphrase
again. “Amitabha! Mister Han is talented. He is very well suited
for the Buddha arts. If you ever come and visit us, I will be
eagerly waiting for Han Sen’s Buddha-talk.”</p>
<p>Clear Sea Buddha, saying something like that, put another shock
upon the assembly of Narrow Moon.</p>
<p>“This is too much!” Han Sen frowned. Ancient Devil’s mind was
stronger than he thought. Even the Buddha were shocked by it
all</p>
