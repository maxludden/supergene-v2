  “Twelve moons? Han Sen is lucky! Being blessed by Moon God’s twelve moons will have made him stronger.” Moon- Wheel King was sipping on a cup of tea as he spoke.

Yisha smiled. She was satisfied that Han Sen had been able to raise a twelfth moon.

“Twelve moons? Han Sen is not bad.”

“Of course. Otherwise, Knife Queen would not have taken him as a student.”

“Would you say it is possible for him to achieve more than twelve moons?”

“I am afraid that might be too difficult. Over the course of a few hundred years, only four or five outsiders have been able to achieve twelve moons. The chances of him getting more are too low.”

As everyone rabidly discussed this, another moon rose up into the sky.

“Thirteen moons? He broke through the expected threshold!”

“Interesting. Queen really did find herself a special student. Han Sen must be something special. He sure has a bevy of good luck.”

Night River King was in shock. He didn’t expect that Han Sen could bring up twelve moons.

Night River King had lost the Dragon Steel he had offered in the wager, but he did not mind. He said, “I didn’t expect Han Sen to be this lucky. I will have the Dragon Steel delivered to Planet Black-Moon later.”

Black-Moon King smiled and responded by saying, “Night River, would you like to make another wager?”

“What else can we bet on?” Night River King was shocked by the offer.

To see whether or not he can raise twenty-four moons,” Black-Moon King said.

“Black-Moon, it sounds to me as if you really admire the boy. Do you honestly believe he is that talented?” Black River King looked at Black-Moon King with much surprise.

Yes, I do,” Black-Moon responded.

“Okay. In that case, I will conduct this wager again, and I still want to compete for that Steel Knife of yours. What would you like?” Night River King said quickly.

Black-Moon King slowly said, “A Magic Steel.”

Night River King frowned, but he nodded. “Fine. Since you have Dragon Steel, it is pointless to hold onto Magic Steel. Assuming you win, you can take the Magic Steel if Han Sen is able to raise twenty-four moons.”

“Okay, then.” Black-Moon King’s lips were smiling.

The moons kept on rising, and before long, there were eighteen of them hanging in the sky.

“Wow, there is now eighteen of them. He must be all tapped out by now.”

“Whoa, it is still continuing! He’s at nineteen.” “Interesting. Can this guy really raise twenty-four moons?”

Yisha was in a good mood, right now. It had been difficult getting him to evolve twice. But after that, she had been satisfied with every result following her expenditure. She was starting to think she had really lucked out by taking him on.

But thinking about how to get him to Viscount, Earl, Marquise, and then Duke was something that was giving Yisha a bit of a headache.

The Story of Genes’ modifications had not gone well. If Han Sen practiced it, it’d cost a lot of resources each and every time. Getting him to the level of a Baron had already been very hard, so she couldn’t even comprehend how much it might cost her if she brought him all the way up to Duke.

Icebird Duke was surprised Han Sen had been so lucky. He had eighteen moons now.

The tally of moons kept rising without slowing down. Eventually, Han Sen had reached the prestigious number of twenty-four.

“I lost.” Night River King frowned. Han Sen’s performance had surprised him a great deal.

But this was just the beginning. After the number twenty-four, another moon appeared in the skies above Moon Palace. “Damn! Another moon? Twenty-five? He broke the outsider record!”

“Is he insane?”

“Queen really is sharp. He must be the luckiest outsider ever.”

“Still rising… Twenty-six.” Oh my god… Might he be a Rebate just pretending to be an outsider?”

“This is insane! This number is the average of a

Rebate. Many of the Rebate can’t even reach this far.”

“It looks like the Moon God really fancies him.” “Shit! Twenty-seven! Surely he cannot reach

thirty-six.”

After all the moons that had risen, Narrow Moon was losing its stability. Many people stood up and stared at the Moon Palace.

“Oh my god! Thirty!”

Many Nobles, like Night River King, Black-Moon King, and Yisha, were all shocked. No one had guessed that it was even possible for Han Sen to raise so many moons.

The Moon God’s blessing wasn’t normally very too powerful or beneficial, but when you reached that sort of number, the reinforcements turned into something special.

Another moon came up, and then Narrow Moon went quiet. It was the thirty-sixth. That was the highest any Rebate had ever been blessed with.

“He really did raise thirty-six moons! He is totally a fake outsider.” Many of the Rebate had wry smiles. They felt extremely jealous.

Thirty-six moons was a very rare number amongst the Rebate.

“He is lucky.” Moon Wheel King took a sip of tea and then let out a lengthy sigh.

The next second, he almost choked on the tea in his mouth.

Above the palace, another moon came up.

The whole of Narrow Moon was quiet. The Dukes, and everyone there, had their mouths open. And yet, no one spoke.

“Impossible.” Night River King suddenly stood up. He stared at the Moon Palace’s thirty-seventh moon.

Yisha was shocked, as well. Thirty-six plus one moon was something no Rebate had ever seen before, across a million years.

Everyone thought thirty-six was the highest he could achieve, but what they had just witnessed told them that it wasn’t.

Icebird Duke wore a complex expression on her face. Her mouth was open wide, and she looked to be in disbelief.

“This is madness…”

Moon Palace now had thirty-seven moons overhead.

Someone couldn’t help but scream.

All the Nobles felt very conflicted. Especially those of the Rebate. They were so proud of this festival, but now their pride in it was waning. The person who had been able to raise the most moons in the festival’s history was no longer a Rebate.

And that was just the start of the insanity. All the Nobles were shocked, confused, and also suspicious. Another moon arose in the sky.
