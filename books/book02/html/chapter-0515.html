    <p>
      &#8220;How long have you spent in God&#8217;s Sanctuary?&#8221; Yi Dongmu
      asked Han Sen.
    </p>

    <p>&#8220;Not long, just a few days.&#8221; Han Sen said.</p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Have you heard about Dollar recently?&#8221; Yi Dongmu had spent
      about six months in the God&#8217;s Sanctuary this time. He had been
      hunting alone all the time and did not have any news from the outside.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen was dazed, as he did not expect that was what Yi Dongmu would ask.
      He thought about it and said, &#8220;I heard that there was someone named
      Kill Dollar on the official platform. He had won consecutively. Some
      people said he was Dollar himself, and I wondered if that was true.&#8221;
    </p>

    <p>&#8220;Tell me about the details,&#8221; Yi Dongmu said immediately.</p>

    <p>
      Having taken the mutant meat, Han Sen explained briefly to Yi Dongmu, and
      added in the end deliberately, &#8220;I have only heard about it. No one
      knows whether Kill Dollar&#8217;s actual Dollar. And I will be the last
      one to tell.&#8221;
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;It must be him. Except for him, no one could be that good,&#8221;
      Yi Dongmu said assertively.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen was embarrassed inwardly. There were definitely evolvers who could
      be as good. He just had not met a truly good opponent.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;I want to hunt a sacred-blood creature and need an assistant. Come
      with me, I will spare you 10% of the meat after I succeed,&#8221; Yi
      Dongmu said to Han Sen after eating a smaller half of the barbecue and
      taking the rest into his pocket.
    </p>

    <p>&#8220;20%,&#8221; Han Sen blinked and doubled the price.</p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Let&#8217;s go.&#8221; Yi Dongmu did not bargain and asked Han Sen
      to go with him.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen like people like this a lot. Rich people who did not care about
      the price and only cared to be happy are the best.
    </p>

    <p>
      Following Yi Dongmu eastward on the icefield, Han Sen reached the
      snowcapped mountains in less than two days. If he were to go back to
      Goddess shelter, he must cross this region.
    </p>

    <p>
      However, because of the terrain, it was not easy to pass this region.
      Furthermore, if he encountered sacred-blood creatures, it was too
      dangerous to fight on the mountains without the ability to fly. If he were
      not careful, he would fall into deep valleys.
    </p>

    <p>
      The reason that Li Xinglun and Blackgod would try to conquer the royal
      shelter before they expand to the mountainous region was because of the
      terrain, which was unsuitable for large-scale fights.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;You are not trying to enter the mountains to hunt sacred-blood
      creatures?&#8221; Han Sen asked Yi Dongmu, surprised.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Relax, there is no risks. I&#8217;m only asking you to lure the
      creature out for me. The rest is my job. That creature had suffered in my
      hands, so it would not there to come out if I were there,&#8221; Yi Dongmu
      said quietly.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen did not say anything more and followed Yi Dongmu into the
      snowcapped mountains. Like Yi Dongmu said, he did not go deep into the
      mountains, but stopped after climbing one mountain.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Just walk around ahead of me. When the creature had come out, run
      in my direction.&#8221; Yi Dongmu dug a hole in the snow and lay down,
      asking Han Sen to bury him with the snow.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen knew that like himself, Yi Dongmu was also an assassin. He did not
      say much and followed Yi Dongmu&#8217;s instruction, walking around in the
      valley ahead of him.
    </p>

    <p>
      Looking around, all he could see was continuous snowcapped mountains.
      There were no creatures, let alone sacred-blood creatures.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;What creatures would be here?&#8221; Han Sen looked for a while and
      did not spot any creatures.
    </p>

    <p>
      As Han Sen became impatient, he suddenly heard hoofbeat. From afar, he saw
      a donkey-like creature with a pair of antlers running from behind a
      mountain.
    </p>

    <p>
      Its hooves were rather wide, which prevented it from being trapped in the
      snow. It ran toward Han Sen quickly, faster and faster.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;There is a creature indeed!&#8221; Han Sen did not know whether
      this one was the one that Yi Dongmu was talking about. He turned around to
      run toward were Yi Dongmu was hiding.
    </p>

    <p>
      The creature looked like it could fly, running fast on the snow. Luckily,
      Han Sen was close to where Yi Dongmu was hiding and soon reached him.
    </p>

    <p>
      The creature followed Han Sen and approached him quickly. Yi Dongmu
      quickly emerged from underneath the snow, appearing under the stomach of
      the creature, stabbing his dagger into its stomach, making a long cut.
    </p>

    <p>
      The creature was bleeding on its stomach. Forgetting about Han Sen, it
      neighed, turned around and ran.
    </p>

    <p>
      However, Yi Dongmu would never let it go. Catching up with it, he cut the
      creature repeatedly. The creature finally fell on the floor quietly.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Good skills, good footwork.&#8221; Han Sen couldn&#8217;t help
      complimenting. Yi Dongmu had made great progress in these years indeed. In
      addition, he was in Second God&#8217;s Sanctuary several years earlier, so
      he had improved his geno points greatly.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;If it were Dollar, he would have killed the creature with the first
      strike. I am not good enough.&#8221; Yi Dongmu said seriously.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen felt very embarrassed inwardly. Yi Dongmu was simply obsessed.
    </p>

    <p>
      It should have been several years since Yi Dongmu saw him. So, there was
      no way Yi Dongmu knew what level Han Sen was on. It was completely his own
      illusion.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Is that the sacred-blood creature that you were talking
      about?&#8221; Han Sen walked up to the creature and asked, puzzled.
    </p>

    <p>
      Although this creature ran fast, it did not look like a sacred-blood
      creature judging from its fitness.
    </p>

    <p>
      Yi Dongmu shook his head. &#8220;Not this one. This is a mutant
      creature.&#8221;
    </p>

    <p>
      Yi Dongmu then paused and said, &#8220;This is good as well. We will use
      this body as the bait. That creature would come out smelling the blood.
      You can stay here and make a barbecue out of this mutant creature.&#8221;
    </p>

    <p>Yi Dongmu then dug another hole and hid himself again.</p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Brother, you do not need to work so hard. How about we continue
      after eating something together?&#8221; Asked Han Sen.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;No need. If it were Dollar, he would have done even better.&#8221;
      Yi Dongmu said seriously and urged Han Sen to bury him up.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen did not know what to say. Even he felt somewhat embarrassed. He
      did not feel he was as good as Yi Dongmu had described.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen buried Yi Dongmu up again. Dissecting the mutant creature&#8217;s
      body, Han Sen thought it was a bit too big for him to eat. He then
      summoned Meowth to offer him the food.
    </p>

    <p>
      Meowth bit the body of the mutant creature excitedly. As for Archangel,
      she did not care to eat mutant meat at all, not wanting to come out.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen took out a piece of barbecued snake fish king, eating while
      squatting. He soon heard the voice telling him the increase of sacred geno
      points.
    </p>

    <p>
      Seeing that Han Sen was feeding mutant meat to his pet, Yi Dongmu frowned
      slightly. This behavior was a bit too extravagant. Even Yi Dongmu himself
      had never done that before.
    </p>

    <p>
      After all, the resources on this icefield were so limited that Yi Dongmu
      had not even filled up his mutant geno points yet.
    </p>

    <p>
      After Han Sen had just taken a few bites, he heard loud hoofbeat behind
      the mountain again.
