<p>“You know nothing. This is the sky silk picture that was drawn
by the Extreme King’s Shadow King. This picture is of the love of
Shadow King’s life, but it is a shame that he could not get her.
Shadow King saw his lover fly to the sky and break the door. She
entered the geno hall, which meant he knew he would never see her
again. In his profound sadness, he decided to draw this sky silk
picture.”</p>
<p>After pausing, Holy Pirate said, “This picture shows how much
Shadow King misses her. This is not like an ordinary picture. You
can never find a picture that evokes as much emotion as this… What
a good picture…”</p>
<p>Holy Pirate did not look at Han Sen as he spoke. He kept
inspecting the silk picture and admiring it.</p>
<p>“Did the people of the Extreme King use this picture to exchange
with my life?” Han Sen stabbed at a guess.</p>
<p>“You just sit tight here, and I will leave you alone. If you do
not be honest with me, I will lock you up.” Holy Pirate did not
look at Han Sen. He thought he was so good that Han Sen could never
escape him.</p>
<p>“Who are you?” Han Sen asked.</p>
<p>“Have you ever heard of Holy Pirate of the Pirates?” Holy Pirate
had a look of pride as he spoke.</p>
<p>“I have heard of the Pirates, but I have never heard of Holy
Pirate before.” Han Sen was not trying to make him mad. He had
truly never heard of the man. After all, Han Sen did not know much
about the universe. For someone like Holy Pirate, if someone had
not mentioned him, he would not have known.</p>
<p>“It does not matter if you don’t know. Just sit and wait here.”
Holy Pirate said that and then ignored Han Sen. He kept admiring
the sky silk picture.</p>
<p>Han Sen tried asking the man a few questions, but Holy Pirate
totally ignored him. He was captivated by the silk picture.</p>
<p>Han Sen leaned his head over to get a closer look. He noticed
that above cloud nine, there was a temple that looked like a
palace. It looked like the geno hall he used to see.</p>
<p>Han Sen sought to ask who the woman in the picture was. After
all, she had the power to go to the geno hall. She had to have been
a supremely powerful elite.</p>
<p>But Holy Pirate was completely ignoring him. He was obsessed
with the picture. Saliva was almost drooling out of his mouth.</p>
<p>He had two bites of the fruit. It was very sweet. A warm
sensation began to spread inside his body. He thought it might have
been something truly special. To Han Sen’s current body, fruit like
that did absolutely nothing for him.</p>
<p>This creepy old man calls himself Holy Pirate. He was able to
enter the Space Garden freely. I am afraid his level must be quite
high, but I can’t use any power. I do not think I can escape this
predicament. Han Sen rolled his eyes. He turned to the Holy Pirate
and said, “Can I walk around the valley?”</p>
<p>Seeing the creepy old man ignoring him, Han Sen just walked out.
He wanted to figure out where he was.</p>
<p>The valley was not a big place. Aside from a few wooden houses,
there were weird flowers and strange grasses. There were animals
everywhere. It was a good place to live a nice, private life.</p>
<p>Not long later, Han Sen reached the valley’s entrance. He looked
out and saw something completely different. Yellow sand was
everywhere. Beyond the valley was one vast desert wasteland. It was
a completely different world to the bosom of that valley.</p>
<p>Han Sen did not fancy leaving the valley, so he returned and
walked deeper into the valley.</p>
<p>When Han Sen walked to the end of the wooden houses, he saw a
mountain wall. It displayed a picture. The picture looked to be one
of a chess game that had been left unfinished due to a
stalemate.</p>
<p>This looks like Go, but a Go chessboard only has 19×19 squares.
There are many more squares here on this one. Judging from the
black and white chess pieces and formation, it really does look
like Go. When Han Sen used to practice Heavenly Go, he did some
research on Go. He was not a professional, but he could play chess
pretty well.</p>
<p>After staring at it for some time, he confirmed that its rules
were just like Go. The picture displayed an unfinished match that
was currently in a stalemate.</p>
<p>Is this Holy Pirate obsessed with chess? Is that why he carved a
stalemate on the wall? Is it so he can look at it every day? Han
Sen examined it for a while. He deciphered that in this stalemate,
the white chess pieces were actually at a greater advantage that
could lead to a win. The black chess pieces, on the other hand,
looked weak and destroyed. It seemed as if they were going to
lose.</p>
<p>Han Sen loved playing chess, but he did not have the mood to
play it now. He kept walking further into the valley. It was not
long before Han Sen discovered that every now and again, the cliffs
and walls displayed a picture of a similar stalemate. When Han Sen
walked into the deeper recesses of the valley, he had managed to
count 17 of those stalemates.</p>
<p>Every picture of a stalemate was different. Some of the games
were at the very end, whereas others displayed games that had only
just begun.</p>
<p>Han Sen thought these games of chess were research samples of
what Holy Pirate studied. By inspecting them, they did look like
simple games of chess. They did not seem like worthwhile candidates
for being scrawled onto the walls.</p>
<p>Does this mean Holy Pirate actually sucks at playing chess? Is
that why he puts such simple chess games on the wall? Han Sen did
not think that would be possible.</p>
<p>The will of the deified elites should have been enough to make
them good at Go. Even if they were not particularly talented, there
was no way such a simple chess game could not be understood. There
was no need to carve an example on the wall and observe them every
day.</p>
<p>Aside from those stalemates, Han Sen did not see anything else
in the valley. He did not dare enter the wooden houses. The whole
valley was mostly natural. There weren’t many man-made trails.</p>
<p>When Han Sen returned to the wooden house he had emerged from,
Holy Pirate had already put away his silk picture. He was lying
down on a chair sunbathing. He looked very happy.</p>
<p>“Why… Holy Pirate… Did you put those chess board images on the
mountains?” Han Sen tried to frame the question indirectly, hoping
to find a way to convince Holy Pirate to start talking about them
in a roundabout way.</p>
<p>The Extreme King hated him a lot. If he was in the Extreme
King’s hands, Han Sen did not think he would be safe.</p>
<p>Holy Pirate coldly grunted and said, “If I knew what those chess
games meant, I would not be in this place that not even birds will
come to shit on.”</p>
<p>“What does that mean? Didn’t you carve those chess matches into
the wall?” Han Sen looked at Holy Pirate in shock.</p>
<p>“I would not have the time to do that,” Holy Pirate casually
said. “They were carved by some old fart. He said if I was able to
solve the secrets of the chess games, I could find the treasure he
left. I have been studying them for a few decades and still have
discovered nothing.”</p>
<p>Han Sen’s heart jumped. He looked at Holy Pirate and asked, “If
I can help you solve the secret of the chess matches, will you let
me go?”</p>
<p>“Do not waste your time. I have a title in this universe, and it
is Chess King. After inspecting it for a few decades and not
finding anything, it must have all been a lie concocted by that old
far.” He realized he said something he shouldn’t have, so Holy
Pirate stopped talking.</p>
<p>Han Sen thought they were just ordinary games of chess.
Therefore, he did not examine them closely. After hearing him say
that, he thought now might be a good opportunity. Thus, he went
back to look at the chess matches.</p>
<p>Although he might not have been able to solve the secrets of the
chess matches, this was all Han Sen could do for the time being. If
he discovered the secrets of the chess games, perhaps he could
negotiate with the man.</p>
<p>Han Sen checked out each image once. It was just like the first
time he observed them. There was nothing special. There were just
17 different stalemates.</p>
