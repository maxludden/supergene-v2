<p>Before Han Sen went to find Feng Yin Yin, Feng Fei Fei had
already brought her to where he lived.</p>
<p>“San Mu, I had a discussion with my auntie,” Feng Yin Yin
happily said as she tugged at his arms. “You should move into our
house.”</p>
<p>Han Sen looked at Feng Fei Fei. She smiled and said, “I still
haven’t paid you back for the favor of saving my life. Little Yin
seems to get along with you very well. If you are willing, I would
be happy to allow this.”</p>
<p>“OK.” Han Sen smiled and agreed to the notion. He had something
to ask Feng Yin Yin, so he did not decline the invitation.</p>
<p>Feng Fei Fei did not expect Han Sen to agree so quickly. She was
shocked. “Mister Han, there is something I would like to ask you,”
Feng Fei said with a streak of seriousness.</p>
<p>“I only have a lobby. I do not have a private study. If you do
not mind doing so, please enter my room to have this discussion.”
Han Sen knew Feng Fei Fei wanted to talk to him privately, so that
was why he said that.</p>
<p>Feng Fei Fei hesitated a little, but she ultimately agreed.
“OK.”</p>
<p>Han Sen let Jiang Shi take care of Feng Yin Yin for the time
being while he and Feng Fei Fei entered the room.</p>
<p>Feng Fei Fei would not have entered a man’s room under normal
circumstances, but this was a very urgent matter. She did not care
too much for how appropriate it was.</p>
<p>She checked out Han Sen’s room in detail. The decorations were
basic. It was just like how the hotel was supposed to look, which
disappointed Feng Fei Fei.</p>
<p>She thought people like Han Sen would have some sort of fetish,
but it was actually very normal.</p>
<p>“You can tell me anything,” Han Sen said as he looked at Feng
Fei Fei and sat down on the couch.</p>
<p>Feng Fei Fei had a serious expression as she looked at Han Sen.
She bowed and said, “I am here to thank you for saving my life. I
am also here to save your life.” “What do you mean?” Han Sen looked
at Feng Fei Fei with interest. Feng Fei Fei did not answer.
Instead, she bluntly asked, “Am I correct that it was you who
killed Mister Gong Shu Jin?” “Let’s say I did. What about it?” Han
Sen did not deny it.</p>
<p>Feng Fei Fei sighed and said, “Gong Shu Jin died because of me.
I understand if Gong Shu Zhi cannot let me go. If he really wants
to kill me, he will kill you too.”</p>
<p>“Are you saying it was Gong Shu Zhi who did that to you at the
party?” Han Sen was shocked.</p>
<p>Feng Fei Fei nodded. “I asked a friend to investigate. It was
Gong Shu Zhi. He used my best friend, Si Tu Ya. Otherwise, I would
not have come under the control of that gene race without being
aware. While I thank you for saving me, this will only drive Gong
Shu Zhi to want to kill you more.”</p>
<p>Han Sen smiled at Feng Fei and asked, “If you knew it was Gong
Shu Zhi and Si Tu Ya, why are you letting them walk free?”</p>
<p>“I do not want to let them go, but I can only watch them go.
Yesterday, they were invited to Ice Snow City.” Feng Fei Fei, upon
seeing Han Sen appear confused, explained, “Ice Snow City belongs
to a god-blood noble, Steel Scene. He inherited a God Spirit
Blood-Pulse and has incredible power. Furthermore, Steel Scene has
the kingdom’s guard. He is an important character in the Qin
Kingdom. I am just a singer. Although I am quite famous, no one
would dare offend Mister Steel Scene on behalf of a singer.”</p>
<p>le</p>
<p>“Why would Steel Scene seek to protect Gong Shu Zhi?” Han Sen
quietly asked.</p>
<p>“According to the information I received, Gong Shu Zhi collected
many god-class gene races and gave them to Steel Scene. He now has
Steel Scene’s protection, and he will kill us both.” When Feng Fei
Fei said that, she sounded sad.</p>
<p>If it was just about Gong Shu Zhi, Feng Fei Fei could talk to
him. A god-blood noble like Steel Scene was not someone she could
afford to enrage. She could not just sweep this under the rug.</p>
<p>Some nobles willing to help Feng Fei Fei, but the conditions
made her unwilling to accept.</p>
<p>Feng Fei Fei sought Han Sen out so the two of them could go
against Steel Scene together. Other people did not know Han Sen’s
strength, but she knew. Han Sen was a god-blood noble. He was not
as strong as Steel Scene, but he was not someone that could easily
be killed.</p>
<p>Plus, in Jade Wall City, Steel Scene was not able to randomly go
and murder someone.</p>
<p>Han Sen said anything. He looked a bit murderous. It was as if
he had just made a decision.</p>
<p>Han Sen decided to live with Feng Fei Fei. He did not try to
slow this process down. He had Jiang Shi and Mister Yang pack their
bags. They went to the castle in Jade Wall City that Feng Fei Fei
lived in.</p>
<p>On this day, the castle was not very busy. It was rather quiet.
Feng Fei Fei had Han Sen occupy an independent sector.</p>
<p>Han Sen and Feng Yin Yin went to the garden to play. There was
no one around. He took out the stone ocarina and gave it to Feng
Yin Yin.</p>
<p>“Little Yin, see if you can play a song with this. This ocarina
is weird, so you need power to operate it.”</p>
<p>Although Feng Fei Fei had greater power than Feng Yin Yin, Han
Sen did not fully trust her. He did not want her to see the gold
lightning in the clouds. He only allowed Feng Yin Yin to play with
it.</p>
<p>“Let me try.” Feng Yin Yin took the stone ocarina and summoned
the mutant eight sound bug and autumn cicada. The two gene races
combined.</p>
<p>Combining with two gene races required a lot of will and
vitality. Ordinary gene casters exhausted all their strength by
attempting it.</p>
<p>Feng Yin Yin had only owned two gene races for a little while,
yet she was already able to combine the pair. She was very
talented.</p>
<p>After successfully combining, Feng Yin Yin looked at Han Sen and
asked, “San Mu, what song would you like me to play?” “Just play a
song that evokes the most emotion,” Han Sen quickly said. If he had
guessed correctly, it was not a higher pitch in the music that made
the gold lightning marks show up. It was all dependent on the
amount of emotion that was put in.</p>
<p>Feng Yin Yin nodded. She thought for a moment before putting the
stone ocarina next to her lips to play it.</p>
<p>The ocarina was supposed to sound sad. Feng Yin Yin’s
performance made people feel refreshed and rejuvenated. Han Sen’s
ears felt like new after listening to it.</p>
<p>As Feng Yin Yin played, some smoke came out of the ocarina. It
created a cloud above her head. That cloud had a godly tone. It was
like a god demon was praying inside.</p>
<p>After a while, Han Sen saw that the cloud had some gold
lightning. There was more this time. It turned into the gold
lightning mark.</p>
<p>Han Sen was happy. He observed the gold lightning marks to
understand how amazing it all was.</p>
