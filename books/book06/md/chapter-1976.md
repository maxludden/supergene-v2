  The Xuanyuan Dragon turned to Han Sen and breathed out smoke. Han Sen fell back and swung the Ghost Teeth Knife, breaking the black smoke.

Xuanyuan Dragon spun around and put its attention back on Yun Sushang. Thousand Feather Crane was coming, but he was not as fast as the dragon.

First Day cast True Light, but his attack didn’t reach the dragon. He screamed, “He’s too fast!”

What First Day said gave Han Sen inspiration. He had just created Turtle, and he had almost forgotten that it specialized in bringing down a creature’s speed.

Xuanyuan Dragon was almost in front of Yun Sushang, and Han Sen’s legs sent him leaping forward at incredible speed. He gathered up power in his hand and brought a slap towards the black horse.

The rabbit shoes’ speed was equal to that of the dragon. And in no time at all, a jade white palm came pressing against the dragon’s head.

Thousand Feather Crane and the others did not think Han Sen’s palm would achieve much. They knew Han Sen was wielding a King class knife, and they knew he had practiced Teeth Knife; if those skills could not damage the dragon, what could a palm do?

Thousand Feather Crane and First Day were out of range, and Spell kept firing her pistols ineffectually at the dragon. Yun Sushang obviously thought that she was about to die, so she pushed Yun Suyi away. Then, her body exploded with a cloud. She was going to fight the dragon with everything she had remaining.

Pang!

Han Sen slapped the Xuanyuan Dragon’s head. Then, the horse-looking dragon fell out of the air. It was like Han Sen had knocked him down to the floor.

Thousand Feather Crane and the others were all in shock. They looked at the Xuanyuan Dragon, that was now lying on the ground. And there, were Han Sen had delivered his strike, was the image of Turtle Spell.

The Xuanyuan Dragon slammed into the ground and roared in rage. It flapped its wings as it tried to get back into the air, and that was what surprised Yun Sushang the most.

No matter how much it flapped its wings, the Xuanyuan Dragon could not get airborne again. It was like a duck, attempting to take off. Ultimately, despite all its frantic flapping, it couldn’t get off the ground.

Yun Sushang’s mouth dropped wide open as she stared at the dragon. This was too powerful, and they were all gobsmacked.

“What are you gawking at? Run!” Han Sen yelled at them, snapping them out of their daze.

Yun Sushang pulled Yun Suyi away. First Day followed from behind, casting True Spell on the dragon. Thousand Feather Crane was attacking, too.

But they were all drained by now, and their attacks lacked the vigor they’d possessed earlier.

The dragon was really angry at Han Sen. It completely ignored First Day and Thousand Feather Crane’s attacks. It tried coming for Han Sen. It did not fly to him, and instead it wriggled and crawled. It moved forward steadily, if much more slowly.

Han Sen, seeing the Xuanyuan Dragon’s speed, became very happy. With how slowly the dragon was now moving, and there was no need for Han Sen to feel threatened.

There was another pang noise as the Xuanyuan Dragon broke Thousand Feather Crane’s sword air and First Day’s True Spell. It continued coming for Han Sen, venting smoke from its mouth.

Han Sen moved. He dodged the thickest section of the smoke. He slashed with his knife and cut through the smoke. Then, he moved to the dragon’s side and slapped the dragon’s face.

Another Turtle Spell manifested on the dragon’s face, dropping its speed yet again.

Han Sen moved like a shadow. He put away his Ghost Teeth Knife, opened his hands, and repeatedly slapped the dragon in the face.

The Xuanyuan Dragon was so slow. It couldn’t catch up with Han Sen and his rabbit shoes, so there was nothing to keep Han Sen from continuing to b*tchslap it in the face. Images of the Turtle Spell covered its face.

Thousand Feather Crane and First Day watched Han Sen beating on the creature. The fleeing sisters stopped running. Their mouths opened wide, unable to quite fathom what they were seeing.

The Xuanyuan Dragon was acting as if it was stupid. It stood where it was, allowing Han Sen to slap it non-stop. It was getting slower and slower, and the scene played out as if it was in slow-motion.

Han Sen felt very good hitting it, and as he did so, he thought to himself, “Slap your turtle, son! Fly! Slap your turtle, son! Run!”

First Day and the others could guess that Han Sen’s slapping was some sort of geno art that slowed down the speed of an opponent. First Day had a geno art like that, but it hadn’t worked on the Xuanyuan Dragon when he tried it.

They were both Earls, yet Han Sen’s geno art was far more effective on the Xuanyuan Dragon. It confused First Day.

Han Sen did not think his Turtle would be that great. It could stop a foe from flying, and it could slow an enemy down. Surprisingly, it worked on a dragon that was a Marquise and a mutant.

But the strangeness soon wore off. Turtle came from the Jade Turtle Spell. The Jade Turtle was created from the remains of an old deified turtle shell. The power was deified. Han Sen also included his experience under the suppression of the deified Sky Palace leader, then threw in Dollar for good measure. With Han Sen’s current power, Turtle might not have been able to subdue a King class enemy, but it worked just fine on Marquises or Dukes.

And Turtle could stack. Han Sen continued to slap the Xuanyuan Dragon, and in the end, the dragon was as slow as a snail. It was like a slow-motion scene on TV.

The Xuanyuan Dragon was so angry that its eyes almost popped from their sockets. Its gaze was burning with hatred. If stares could kill, it would have murdered Han Sen a long time ago.

The dragon might only have the speed of a turtle now, but its power had not been affected. It could still exhale toxic air, but it could not move and it could not hit the nimble Han Seen with the smoke.

Han Sen kept using Teeth Knife to slash at the dragon’s neck. He struck the beast hundreds of times, and knifelights were everywhere. Not long after, the dragon’s neck started to bleed. The blood gleamed visibly in the knifelight.

Thousand Feather Crane and the others could tell the dragon was going to perish, so they didn’t help out. They didn’t want to steal the kill. They did, however, commit to clearing the Ghost Claw Beasts that were still nearby.

Yun Suyi saw the knifelight reflecting off the blood and stared, deep in thought.

Patong!

The screams of the Xuanyuan Dragon suddenly cut off as Ghost Teeth Knife severed the dragon’s head.

“Xenogeneic Marquise mutant hunted. Xuanyuan Dragon: xenogeneic gene found. Obtained mutant Xuanyuan Dragon beast soul.”
