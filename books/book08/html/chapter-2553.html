<p>Because of the videos that Kings in the core area made and
distributed, many elites across the universe were able to watch
what was going on there. After hearing what Elysian Moon said, many
angry eyes focused on Han Sen. Countless young men wanted to beat
up Han Sen to save those two pretty girls.</p>
<p>Of course, young men who thought that way generally didn’t have
the necessary rank to visit the core area. The Kings that were
watching from inside the core area didn’t move.</p>
<p>“Is what you said true?” Autumn Wind asked with excitement, his
eyes looking bright.</p>
<p>“If you don’t believe me, then why are you asking me?” Elysian
Moon smiled.</p>
<p>“I believe you, my Lady.” Autumn Wind nodded, then he turned to
Han Sen. “Can you please fight me? Don’t worry; I will only beat
you on behalf of the lady’s request. I won’t kill you.”</p>
<p>“This guy is pretty confident,” Han Sen thought, suppressing a
laugh. He looked at Autumn Wind and said, “I can fight you. If you
win, you see the girls. If I win, what do I earn?”</p>
<p>“Right,” Autumn Wind said, nodding his agreement. “What do you
want?”</p>
<p>Han Sen was surprised. He hadn’t expected Autumn Wind to say
something like that. He looked at Autumn Wind, thinking he was a
funny guy.</p>
<p>Han Sen went silent and said, “If you lose, why don’t you pull
the rickshaw just like he is?”</p>
<p>“Sure.” Autumn Wind didn’t even think about it before he agreed.
He probably never expected that he might actually lose.</p>
<p>Han Sen stood up and climbed off the carriage. He stood ten
meters away from Autumn Wind.</p>
<p>Autumn Wind looked at Han Sen and said, “Use whatever attack you
want. If you can hurt me, you win.”</p>
<p>“Thi guy is saying crazier things than I usually do…” Han Sen
thought, looking at the man. Autumn Wind had a bow on his back, and
seeing it prompted Han Sen to say, “Loan me your bow. I will shoot
at you a few times. If you can’t dodge my arrows, then you
lose.”</p>
<p>“Shit, this guy is obscene! He must know Autumn Wind’s bow is
the Aichi’s deified treasure Wind String. He wants to scam the
treasure off of him.”</p>
<p>“Who would dare do such a thing? Does he think Autumn Wind is
stupid?”</p>
<p>“Not many people would happily hand over a deified treasure to
someone else. Even if they did, they wouldn’t hand it to an
enemy.”</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>While everyone complained, Autumn Wind took the bow and quiver
off his back. He threw them to Han Sen. The Kings around them
stared blankly at the two.</p>
<p>“He really did loan it to him.”</p>
<p>“Shit! Han Sen just scored big. Run!”</p>
<p>“Is he really going to shoot the bow? Autumn Wind just handed it
to him.”</p>
<p>“Go ahead. Shoot me any way you want until you are satisfied.”
Autumn Wind appeared lackadaisical, and he spoke to Han Sen in a
very casual manner.</p>
<p>Han Sen picked up the bow and quiver. He noticed that the quiver
contained ten arrows. He spoke to Autumn Wind and said, “There are
ten arrows. I will shoot at you ten times. If I miss them all, then
I lose.”</p>
<p>Autumn Wind nodded and said, “Sure. If you can get one arrow to
touch my body, then I lose.”</p>
<p>Han Sen didn’t say anything more. He just gripped Autumn Wind’s
bow tightly.</p>
<p>The bow looked very ordinary. Its body appeared to have been
constructed from old vines. It looked like a very old-fashioned
longbow. The string was a half-transparent, and it was as thin as a
hair. It was very tightly strung, though. Han Sen didn’t know what
kind of creature’s tendon it came from.</p>
<p>The moment Han Sen grabbed the bow, Autumn Wind’s face looked
glum. That was because when Han Sen picked up the bow, Autumn Wing
could tell that he was proficient with the weapon. Han Sen was
doubtless an excellent archer.</p>
<p>However, Autumn Wind hadn’t given Han Sen his bow because he was
stupid.</p>
<p>In fact, Autumn Wind was very smart. There weren’t many that
could make use of Wind String. It was one of the Aichi’s secret
treasures, and only the blood of the Aichi could activate it.</p>
<p>The Wind String was a very spiritual item, and Autumn Wind had
already earned its approval. Even if someone took it away from him,
they wouldn’t be able to use it. Han Sen’s attempts to shoot the
bow would be pointless. The weapon wouldn’t help him, and he might
even end up getting hurt by it.</p>
<p>Autumn Wind being so polite simply because he wanted the two
women to have a good impression of his character. If Han Sen used
Wind String to shoot him, he wouldn’t even have to move. Han Sen
would miss and end up getting hurt by Wind String himself.</p>
<p>When he saw how comfortable Han Sen seemed to be when he handled
the bow, Autumn Wind realized that Han Sen must be very good at
archery. An elite like that shouldn’t have been clueless about Wind
String, though. So, it begged the question why Han Sen would
request to borrow it.</p>
<p>Han Sen stroked the Wind String’s body. Then, he slipped two
fingers around the string and tried to pull it.</p>
<p>As everyone observed, that silk-like, half-transparent string
didn’t budge.</p>
<p>“Pfff!” The Kings and nobles who saw this almost spat out
whatever was in their mouths.</p>
<p>After half a day, Han Sen was unable to move the bow’s string.
There was no need for the competition. Han Sen couldn’t even fire a
single arrow.</p>
<p>“Han Sen is too naive. Did he really think Autumn Wind was
letting him the bow out of the goodness of his heart? This is the
Aichi’s Wind String. Without the blood of an Aichi, it cannot be
used.”</p>
<p>“Yeah. How could I forget that? That is Wind String. When the
Aichi were going through their roughest period of history, their
final deified passed away. They haven’t had a deified since that
time. The race of the Bonas attacked the Aichi and stole Wind
String from them. Then, the Bona’s king tried to show off Wind
String at a party. It was given to a general who was a master with
the bow. He took the bow, and the king asked him for an archery
performance. But that general, despite trying all sorts of
different powers, couldn’t get the bow’s string to move.”</p>
<p>“The king of the Bonas saw this, and he commanded another
general to work with the first general. One of them held the bow
while the other pulled back the string. They tried to force Wind
String open. They did manage to draw Wind String, but after they
drew it, the string came to life like a thunderstorm. Wind String
started to move by itself, and somehow, the string cut the heads
off both of the generals. Ever since then, no one who owned Wind
String was able to wield it. They all ended up getting hurt by it.
It was even said to bring bad luck. That was until Wind String was
brought back to its rightful place. The Aichi elite who retrieved
it killed many people with Wind String and eventually became
deified. It brought the Aichi race back to life and relevance. As a
result, Wind String’s name became very famous across the universe.
But aside from the Aichi, no others dare to use the bow.”</p>
<p>“No wonder Autumn Wind was so quick to give the bow away. It
really is the Wind String.”</p>
