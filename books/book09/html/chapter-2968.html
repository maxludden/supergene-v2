<p>If he was able to save Golden Growler, perhaps there was a
chance. Even if it was hard to fight Moment God, they could still
possibly escape.</p>
<p>Moment God looked very cold. She did not have any emotions. The
10 fingers on her hands came together. The very 10 ten fingers made
a weird print and pressed forward.</p>
<p>Suddenly, the whole of the god temple’s space underwent strange
changes. Han Sen saw the slash that almost hit Golden Growler go
back.</p>
<p>Things felt as if he was in a video that was rewinding.</p>
<p>“Time Rewind!” Han Sen was shocked. It was very scary that she
could stop time almost forever, but it was even more threatening to
learn that Moment God could actually rewind time. Even if it was
only for a moment, it was too scary to try and comprehend.</p>
<p>“Go!” Han Sen coldly shouted. He went backward. He wanted to use
his teleportation power to exist Moment God Temple. Moment God had
her Time Rewind power. Even if he risked his life, the likelihood
of winning was low.</p>
<p>The green-haired beast and Gana woman knew the situation was
terrible. They used all of their power to try and leave Moment God
Temple’s radius.</p>
<p>Moment God’s print tied up again. Time rewound again. Han Sen
and the others teleported. They all went flying backward.</p>
<p>Moment God’s body moved. She walked over to Han Sen, who had
just come back. Her hand reached out for him.</p>
<p>Han Sen was still falling back in the river of time. His body
was still going through what he had just done. He was unable to
change his movements. His power burst out, but it was useless. He
could see Moment God’s palm was going to touch his back.</p>
<p>Blergh!</p>
<p>Han Sen coughed up some blood. His body instantly ripped space.
He flew out of the god palace like an asteroid. He was not stopping
either. He hit a planet in the universe and blew up the planet.
Dust was everywhere.</p>
<p>Creatures from every race were frozen as they watched. Even
Godfather Han was unable to beat that enemy. Moment God’s scariness
was deeply realized within the heads of every living thing.</p>
<p>Moment God looked at where Han Sen had flown to. She looked
weird. It looked as if she was trying to confirm something. She
stared at the planet Han Sen had blown up.</p>
<p>The green-haired beast and Gana woman took advantage of the time
when Moment God did nothing. They left Moment God Temple. Moment
God did not seem to care about their departure. She stared at the
dust in space and ignored them.</p>
<p>Han Sen felt as if his entire back was broken. It was too
painful for him to move. He held strong against the pain and used
his Galaxy Teleportation to return to Space Garden.</p>
<p>He teleported halfway. His body was in too much pain. He fell
out of the teleportation in the middle of the jump. Bao’er caught
him in space. She held him and teleported him the rest of the way.
They returned to Space Garden.</p>
<p>Bao’er put Han Sen down on the bed and asked with a real look of
concern, “Dad! Are you feeling better?”</p>
<p>“Not bad. I am still alive at least.” Han Sen used a lot of
power to speak. More blood came out of his mouth.</p>
<p>“I will go and get Little Silver,” Bao’er said. She jumped away
and eventually brought Little Silver to the side of his bed.</p>
<p>Little Silver had very much enjoyed Space Garden’s xenogeneic
genes, and Han Sen had fed it the high-level thunder xenogeneic
gene. Furthermore, Golden Growler had given him Ancient Thunder God
Origin, which had greatly accelerated his ability to level up. He
was a primitive deified now.</p>
<p>The Ancient Thunder God Origin, in particular, had helped Little
Silver a lot. It made his genes better. Although his attack power
was not very strong, his healing power was far greater.</p>
<p>“No… It is OK… I am fine… Argh…” Han Sen wanted to refuse it,
but Little Silver’s lightning landed on him. It made Han Sen’s
brain feel numb as he screamed.</p>
<p>“Take off my robe first,” Han Sen said while holding in the
pain.</p>
<p>Bao’er quickly held Han Sen up. She took off his blue and black
striped robe. When she saw his back underneath the robe, she
screamed.</p>
<p>The back of the robe had a big hole in it. The hole was shaped
like the woman’s hand. It was where Moment God had struck him.</p>
<p>Han Sen saw the hole of a hand in the robe. It made him develop
a wry smile. “Fortunately, this robe blocked a little. Otherwise,
even if I did not die, I would only have half my life left.”</p>
<p>Han Sen turned around and laid down on the bed. The Spell Armor
on his back had the print of a hand as well. Fortunately, it did
not pierce through him.</p>
<p>Even so, Han Sen’s backbone had almost been destroyed. It was
very hard to cast power across his body.</p>
<p>“Annihilation class God Spirits sure are scary. I couldn’t even
use a super God Spirit body to challenge it.” Han Sen wanted to get
up, but Little Silver amplified the amount of lightning he was
using.</p>
<p>Han Sen’s body felt very itchy and numb again. He screamed
again. “Argh!”</p>
<p>Little Silver’s thunder healing was not bad. It helped Han Sen’s
true god body, but the treatment process was as awful as ever.</p>
<p>After Han Sen felt a bit better, he was going to let Little
Silver go. Little Silver insisted on fixing him. He kept releasing
lightning to electrify Han Sen. It made his legs go soft.</p>
<p>It was a shame Little Silver was only primitive class. After he
used all of his thunder power, he was still unable to patch up Han
Sen’s entire body.</p>
<p>“OK, OK, I am feeling much better now.” Han Sen held his pain in
and got out of bed. He looked outside the room and saw Moment God
Temple in space.</p>
<p>Moment God had returned to her god temple somehow. One was no
longer able to see her. Golden Growler was still trapped in the
plaza in front of the god temple. It looked like Moment God was not
in a rush to kill it. Or, perhaps she was afraid of something and
decided not to kill Golden Growler.</p>
<p>Han Sen sighed. As long as Golden Growler was not killed, he had
a chance.</p>
<p>Han Sen thought, “I wonder if that Annihilation Sky God Crown
with my xenogeneic body can save Little Gold from Moment Temple.”
He did not think his chances were very high. Moment God’s Time
Rewind was too scary. Whenever time was reversed, Han Sen was
unable to do anything to combat it. Even with powerful power, he
could not cast it.</p>
<p>“Unless I can stay in super God Spirit mode, I will not be
affected by Time Rewind. Then, I can save Little Gold Gold.” Han
Sen looked at Moment God Temple and Golden Growler. His face kept
changing.</p>
