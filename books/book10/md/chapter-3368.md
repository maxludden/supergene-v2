  The Blonde Wan’er did not display the slightest flicker of emotion. It was like she was incapable of rendering them. Her eyes were very cold. It was as if she saw nothing. When she looked at Han Sen, it was as if her focus wasn’t even on him.

“Wan’er.” Han Sen gently called out her name, but he could see Wan’er’s emotionless face show no difference. He knew blonde Wan’er didn’t like him as the black-haired Wan’er did.

Wan’er’s body was wreathed with gold fire. Her blonde hair was straight. She went from an angel goddess to a scary, demon woman.

Han Sen was shocked. This time, the blonde Wan’er looked a bit different from how she did before. The power she wielded was still the reverse Super God Spirit body that had not managed to break the world. Within her reverse Super God Spirit body, Han Sen sensed a familiar power—a power that was highly similar to the black crystal armor.

Wan’er peered at Han Sen. She then raised her arms like she was wielding a blade of judgment. She immediately slashed toward Han Sen.

A gold flame came out from her arms like a blade. When it slashed, it was like a gold punishment. It suddenly broke all the rules and landed on Han Sen’s head.

Han Sen drew his Inch Grey Sword and used his xenogeneic battle body. The Inch Grey Sword’s blade struck Wan’er’s gold light. It created a scary sonic boom.

Han Sen clutched his Inch Grey Sword tightly, but he was driven back so that his feet cleaved a trench in the earth a hundred miles long.

His face changed. “Wan’er! What did Qin Xiu do to you?” He could tell that the strike Wan’er had just unleashed was not merely the reverse Super God Spirit body’s power. It had a black crystal armor power. With the buffing of the black crystal armor power, Wan’er’s reverse Super God Spirit body had not managed to break the world, but she had a battle power that was far scarier than any Break World creature.

Even if Tail Fire Beast was alive, it would not have been able to withstand this power.

Wan’er did not speak. She teleported in front of Han Sen like a killing machine and slashed toward him.

Han Sen’s body exploded with xenogeneic battle body power. The Inch Grey Sword was glowing. He tried his hardest to fight Wan’er, but it almost seemed certain that he was going to lose.

Wan’er was using her power to fight. This sort of fighting was something that exceeded what Han Sen’s body could realistically compete with. No one would have been able to gain an advantage.

Their fight came to a moment in which their brains no longer had to think. Sword lights and gold lights kept crossing each other.

Even though they were using the same skills, Han Sen’s strength was no greater than Wan’er’s. He was at an obvious disadvantage.

However, Han Sen’s skills were better than Wan’er’s. Despite not being able to win, he used all of his skill to prevent actually losing. He could keep things going, but Han Sen clearly felt that Wan’er’s power in the fight was only becoming stronger as time went by. It was like her entire body was showering in the holy, gold light. Every inch of her godly body was releasing godly light. Every time their attacks connected, it was like the volume of her body’s glow became brighter.

“What did Qin Xiu do to her? Why does her body wield the black crystal armor’s power?” Han Sen strongly asked. He knew the black crystal armor was something truly amazing, but he did not know how to commandeer the black crystal armor and take authorship of it.

When the black crystal armor belonged to Han Sen, the only way he could engage xenogeneic mode was through its aid. There was one thing weird about that. The black crystal armor’s power seemed to work for xenogeneic creatures and gene races, but it never really worked much on humans.

Even if Han Sen swallowed it, its power did not help him evolve. Its only benefit was helping Han Sen practice the Story of Genes, and that was it.

“If the black crystal armor was the one that the God Chaos Party Leader mentioned, then why can Qin Xiu use the black crystal armor? Is he really the Human Alpha the God Chaos Party Leader mentioned?” Han Sen did not quite understand.

Dong!

Han Sen blocked Wan’er’s next hand slash. He fell back in the air, holding the Inch Grey Sword as it quivered in response. The impact of that last hit had been far too fierce. In the few minutes their fight had lasted, Wan’er’s power seemed to be getting stronger. Her strength was still accelerating.

“Bao’er, wait for me over there!” Han Sen let Bao’er go. He had to use all of his power to engage in this battle. If he did not, the prediction of a disaster befalling him might come true.

Bao’er was tossed to the side by Han Sen. The small flying fish and Small Cat went with her. Bao’er rode the big version of the small flying fish, holding Small Cat as she observed.

Both of Han Sen’s hands clutched the handle of the Inch Grey Sword. His eyes looked as if they were spreading. Under his eyes, the whole world was now a composition of various substances. He used his sword like a knife and used Under the Sky Knife skills.

Everything was a chess piece with Under the Sky.

Han Sen gave up his reaction to the fight. His brain started spinning like crazy. Swords and humans, humans and the ground, the ground and the sky, were all becoming one. The person was in the game using themselves as a base to affect the entire situation.

Han Sen’s knife skills looked messed up. After all, Han Sen’s knife did not seem to go for Wan’er’s weak spots. The many traces and movements he made looked weird.

A commoner would have thought that Han Sen was just messing around.

This knife skill was in the 33 skies. Qin Xiu was watching and said, “Interesting knife skills, but this knife skill can only block once. He cannot defeat Wan’er. Our grudge is something best resolved through Wan’er’s participation.”

While he was talking, Qin Xiu’s eyes followed Wan’er’s left hand. She was wearing a black crystal ring on her left pinkie. It was releasing some mysterious light.

Han Sen’s hand had the Inch Grey Sword mid-swing. It was unknown how many times he had slashed at this point. He suddenly fell back and departed the battleground with his sword slashing forward like mad.

Boom!

Burning Red Sky’s fires exploded. Countless flames started to ravage. It became many different fire knives that were crazily going toward Wan’er.

Wan’er’s eyes froze. Her gold light exploded. All of the fire knives became gold light air.

But there were too many fire knives. The sky and the earth became a river of fire that kept going for Wan’er without reprieve. The fire knives that were destroyed quickly returned to endlessly assault Wan’er.

Han Sen’s Under the Sky knife skills reached the max. The permission to be Burning Red Sky’s leader reached the max. An infinite fire knife river madly attacked. With as much obscene power as she had, even Wan’er was getting grounded amidst the river of knives. The gold light dimmed.

Upon seeing Wan’er’s gold light start to dim, the fire knife river became crazier. Han Sen’s face did not get better. On this day, he was feeling very restless. He just did not know where this sense of restlessness came from.

Katcha!

A fire knife air broke the gold light that carried Wan’er. It slashed through Wan’er’s shoulder.
