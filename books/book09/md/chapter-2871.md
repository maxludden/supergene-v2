Pluto Peacock had many black feathers. Its neck and other places had blue feathers and green feathers. Its eyes had some feathers with two colors, from blue to green. It also had blue eyeballs and green pupils.

From what Han Sen could tell, Pluto Peacock had reached butterfly class not too long ago. It had become true god class in a recent deathmatch. Its power was not solid yet. It was one of the weaker enemies of the deified fights, so it selected the enemy that was one higher than him.

Aside from Pluto Peacock, there were still two people lower than it. That was the butterfly class Han Sen and Burning Lamp. Han Sen had killed a god spirit, which was really scary. Pluto Peacock did not dare do anything to him. It saw the butterfly Burning Lamp at number 84, so it fancied challenging him.

Burning Lamp looked dim, but he was not afraid of his opponent. Getting into the top 100 was a mission that he accomplished well. It would have been great if he could win. Getting number 99 was not too bad for Burning Lamp. After all, reaching position 99 still guaranteed him a true god weapon. Getting a true god weapon for Buddha was the most thing he could do for Buddha in the waning twilight of his life.

Burning Lamp was not planning on giving up now. Being at number 84 was better than number 99. Aside from a true god weapon at such a rank, he could obtain a true god material. So, Burning Lamp fancied giving it a go. Facing a true god class Pluto Peacock, Burning Lamp did not dare to be careless. He pulled out a knife hidden within his Buddha clothing.

The knife looked a bit weird. It had the shape of a knife, but it did not have a blade. It was like it had not been pulled out. Although it had not been pulled out, there was some buddha light on the body. It was like it was surrounded by a buddha light. It looked kind of holy.

It sort of looks like my knife blank, but it does not look like it. Han Sen could not tell whether it was his knife blank or not, but the buddha light that came from the knife looked like Sky Demon Power. It seemed as if it possessed some sort of cause power, but it was not so pure like Sky Demon Power. It was mixed with another sort of power.

Han Sen looked at God and asked, “Does Buddha have cause powers?” He was not entirely sure what sort of powers Buddha commanded.

God laughed. “The potential of the Buddha is not too good. It was difficult for them to become a higher race, so they learned a little bit out of every race and compiled it all into their own teachings. It is how they survived. That includes their Filling skill. They learned that from one of the dragon’s blood skills. There are many situations like this. The buddha use all sorts of different skills, but none of them are

pure.”

“Do they have the cause power from the demons?” Han Sen asked. “Not exactly,” God said. “The cause power inside the knife exists independently. It is different from the demons, so that is why I think it is interesting.”

“After all, you do not even know what that knife is, right” Han Sen finally understood.

“There are too many weird things in this universe. It is perfectly normal for me not to know.” God laughed. While they were talking, Pluto Peacock suddenly screamed. The back of the peacock opened. The feathers that looked like eyes released some weird eye light. It made the whole of space turn into a weird green and blue color. It felt as if a scary movie was being filmed. “Although Pluto Peacock is just a xenogeneic that does not have many geno arts like a high race, its Pluto powers are very special,” God said. “If he cannot break it, even a true god class would lose.”

“I do not see anything special about it. You make it sound all spooky and powerful, but Burning Lamp is not hurt.” Han Sen saw Burning Lamp covered in a green and blue light. He was not hurt. He felt weird too.

“That is why Pluto powers are so scary,” God said. “In the universe, isn’t there a saying that ‘time is an invisible, pig-killing knife?’ Their underworld god area is from life to death. In the underworld, living creatures turn into dead spirits. Then, the underworld leader will consume them.”

Han Sen was shocked. He used the Dongxuan Area to look at Pluto Peacock’s underworld god area. He saw the weird green and blue light consuming Burning Lamp’s body. His cells were turning green and blue. Burning Lamp swung the knife at Pluto Peacock, but Pluto Peacock was invincible. Burning Lamp’s knife light was going to touch its body, but the knife went clean through it. He was unable to harm it.

Burning Lamp was using many different geno arts, but none of them could touch Pluto Peacock’s body. Pluto Peacock was standing in the underworld with its rear peacock feathers shining an underworld light.

After a long time of this, Burning Lamp’s skin started to turn into a weird green and blue color. It looked rather transparent. One was able to see his skin and blood vessels on the inside.

The longer this went on, the more underworld-like Burning Lamp was looking. He could not do anything to Pluto Peacock.

“It looks like the knife’s cause power is worse than the demon,” Han Sen said. “It cannot cut off cause power.”

“Although they are cause powers, they are not of the same type,” God said. “It is like the same types of iron. Some irons are used to make knives whereas some irons are made to create shields. They are different.”

“What is the function of that knife?” Han Sen asked.

“You will find out if you keep watching,” God said with a smile. He did not answer Han Sen’s question.

Burning Lamp seemed to be suppressed before Pluto Peacock. No matter what geno art he used, he could not hurt Pluto Peacock. His body gradually became more transparent. He was like a blue and green crystal. You could even see the organs inside him.

Han Sen felt a bit sad. In the past, he seemed to be so strong. Burning Lamp had even turned him into an ant. Now, he was just this.

“It looks like power really does determine everything,” Han Sen said with a sigh.

Han Sen did not believe Burning Lamp would concede so easily. Burning Lamp was a pious individual. If he did not think he could win, he would leave. He would not stay and risk his life.

He was now in a terrible position, yet he showed no sign of wanting to give up. He clearly had a plan.

Han Sen could not figure out how Burning Lamp would triumph over his enemy. From the beginning, up until now, the knife in his hand was not affected by the underworld area. It was still shining with a buddha light. It was not affected by the underworld lamp.

Burning Lamp’s body was becoming half-empty. Pluto Peacock’s eyes flashed. It opened its mouth and started sucking Burning Lamp. Burning Lamp was unable to control his body. He ended up flying toward Pluto Peacock’s mouth and was instantly gone. Pluto Peacock swallowed Burning Lamp. It felt so happy that it screamed. It closed up its peacock feathers. The underworld area was gone. When all the audience believed the fight to be over, Pluto Peacock started screaming. Its chest and belly were suddenly cut open. God blood was pouring out. The knife Burning Lamp was holding had a buddha light. It came out from the wound.
