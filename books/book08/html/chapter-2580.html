<h3>Chapter 2580</h3>

<p>Han Sen immediately loved his new bow. He had recently used
Autumn Wind’s Wind String, but the bow already possessed an owner.
Forcing it open hadn’t felt good.</p>
<p>But this Six Core Snake Bow was different. Han Sen held its body
and pulled the string effortlessly. The cogwheels across it spun as
he drew the string back, and it didn’t cost him any strength to
make use of it. And the power the bow could unleash was just as
great as he had hoped. In fact, this bow was capable of shooting
projectiles with more power than Wind String could have
managed.</p>
<p>Han Sen could feel the space power coming from the bow, but he
didn’t know how that space power would affect the use of the Six
Core Snake Bow.</p>
<p>This was the first time Han Sen had gotten the opportunity to
make use of a deified beast soul weapon. It was difficult to gauge
the amount of power it possessed.</p>
<p>Han Sen didn’t plan on trying it out immediately. He was willing
to save this bow for his true identity as Han Sen. For Dollar, the
gold general already provided enough power to battle deified
beings. Plus, it wouldn’t even be possible for Han Sen to use the
bow while he was using the gold general. Therefore, keeping the bow
as Dollar would be pointless.</p>
<p>However, the weapon couldn’t be more perfect for Han Sen’s
identity. The peacock king’s soul robe wouldn’t affect his use of
the bow, and it would actually give the bow even more power. It
would definitely give him more security.</p>
<p>Even if deifieds came for him, with the peacock king’s soul robe
and the Six Core Snake Bow, they wouldn’t be able to kill Han
Sen.</p>
<p>“If those Extreme King guys dare to come after me again, I will
feed them arrows. I’ll let them know I have feelings, too.”</p>
<p>Han Sen put the Six Core Snake Bow away. He would use it
later.</p>
<p>He had used the Dongxuan Area to hide himself and the small
Crocodile God while he looked over the bow. Not even Exquisite and
Li Keer could see what he was doing now. The Six Core Snake Bow
wouldn’t be noticed.</p>
<p>“All that I’m missing now are deified arrows. Having a bow
without arrows isn’t perfect,” Han Sen thought greedily.</p>
<p>Exquisite and Li Keer were going to chase after Han Sen, but
they soon realized he had vanished from their abilities of
detection. They could no longer detect his presence, no matter what
method they used. They ran to the place where Han Sen was last
seen, but he seemed to be long gone. Not even the Very High Sense
could find a trace of him.</p>
<p>“This Dollar is a very mysterious individual,” Exquisite said
with a frown.</p>
<p>“Not just mysterious. Everything he does is a little beyond
belief, but it will be hard to convince someone like that to become
my silkworm.” Li Keer sighed.</p>
<p>“No matter how strong he is, he cannot elude the Very High
forever. If you really want to pick him, we can go back home and
have the elder unearth his identity. Then, we can formulate a plan
to take him,” Exquisite said.</p>
<p>Li Keer shook her head. “He will be my silkworm. It is best if I
try to bring him in myself.”</p>
<p>Exquisite said nothing, but she didn’t have much hope for Li
Keer’s efforts.</p>
<p>Before she met Dollar, Exquisite would never have expected that
a potential silkworm might refuse an offer from the Very High. But
Han Sen was so amazing that she was even double-guessing the
prestige of her race.</p>
<p>It would be very difficult to convince someone like that to
become a silkworm. Plus, Li Keer’s Very High Sense wasn’t perfect
yet.</p>
<p>But Li Keer insisted, so Exquisite saw no reason to argue.</p>
<p>Han Sen brought the small Crocodile God around with him to hunt.
They killed a few core King xenogeneics. The small Crocodile God
was happy at first, but now he was growing tired.</p>
<p>Han Sen brought out some wine to make the creature happy again,
but the small Crocodile God was becoming harder to please. He
wanted to see the outside world more and more.</p>
<p>“The place I told you about exists, but you can’t see it in the
core area. You are a creature of the core area. You cannot leave.
So, how can I take you to see what is out there?” Han Sen was
annoyed by this prospect, too.</p>
<p>Fortunately, the bronze furnace was there. It was able to help
Han Sen by making the small Crocodile God much happier.</p>
<p>The small Crocodile God had killed many xenogeneics for the
bronze furnace, and now, there were many swords inside the
furnace.</p>
<p>Han Sen used Glasses to examine the furnace. Its potential was
five stars, too. That was the max a King class could be before
becoming deified.</p>
<p>“What a shame. The xenogeneics from the core area cannot leave.
If they could, I could keep them by my side at all times.” Han Sen
sighed.</p>
<p>Han Sen had the bronze furnace lead them around. Han Sen soon
left the core area, though, and he returned to the white whale.</p>
<p>In the past, whenever Han Sen returned, the pirates would
happily welcome him. But this time, no one even noticed when he
appeared. Everyone was watching something outside of the white
whale, and they seemed to be frozen with shock. Even Bao’er
was.</p>
<p>Han Sen didn’t know what was going on. He followed everyone’s
gazes and found that there was a group of snakes coming to the
land. They were emerging from the black sea, and the white tiger
was trying to fight them off.</p>
<p>These battles had happened many times before, but this time, it
was different. There were too many groups of snakes coming out of
the black sea. There were many times the number of snakes that had
appeared on any previous occasion.</p>
<p>The snakes slithered onto the island in hordes and began
munching on the mushrooms. They were scarier than a swarm of
locusts.</p>
<p>The white tiger was killing them, but there were too many
snakes. It was unable to kill them all. The snakes slithered onto
the island in greater and greater numbers.</p>
<p>“Oh no!” Fang Qing Yu suddenly breathed upon seeing the snake
hordes.</p>
<p>“Oh no, what?” the pirates looked at Fang Qing Yu.</p>
<p>Fang Qing Yu looked terrible, and he said, “If the white tiger
cannot stop the snakes, all the mushrooms here will be eaten by the
creatures. That means we will have no food for ourselves.”</p>
<p>“Pah, I thought you meant something more severe. That is no big
deal. We can trade for food in the core area with others,” a pirate
said.</p>
<p>“It’s not that simple. Listen, if all the mushrooms are gone,
then the white tiger might get hungry and come after us. And how
about the snakes themselves? Aside from the mushrooms out there…”
Before Fang Qing Yu finished, everyone knew what he meant.</p>
<p>They all looked at the mushrooms on each other’s heads. They
felt a chill. If the snakes treated them like food, they would have
to stop the snakes’ advance. And that probably wouldn’t go too well
for them.</p>
<p>They had seen how scary the snakes were, as many of them could
be King class. But the snakes also came in seemingly infinite
numbers; it would be impossible to kill them all.</p>
<p>If the white tiger couldn’t stop the snakes, there was little
they could do.</p>
<p>“Little red bird, go out and help,” Han Sen said to the little
red bird. If the snake group took over the island, it would be
quite the annoyance for them. That was why Han Sen allowed the
little red bird to help the white tiger fight off the snakes.But
before the little red bird did anything, a harsh wind blew across
the black sea. It created giant, tumultuous waves as a giant
monster emerged from the black water.</p>
