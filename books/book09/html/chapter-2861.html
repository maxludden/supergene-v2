<h3>Chapter 2861</h3>

<p>Deep Abyss Knight was a xenogeneic. He had an armored knight
upper body and the lower body of an octopus. Many black, metal
tentacles wriggled around his lower body. It was like he had a
weird shadow. Even the space around him was twisted.</p>
<p>Han Sen had watched the Deep Abyss Knight fight before. He knew
that the Deep Abyss Knight was a dark element xenogeneic. He could
release very strong and corrosive dark powers. His defensive
attributes were very high. If a xenogeneic of the same level
attacked his armor, one would be able to break it.</p>
<p>Regarding his metallic tentacles, even if they were cut off,
replacements grew almost instantly. So, attacking the tentacles was
pointless. One had to break the armor or body to succeed.</p>
<p>Han Sen was holding the Return Empty Scabbard. It counted as
half a god personality armament. Although it was man-made, it was
not as powerful as a real god personality armament. Still, it was a
treasure that was close to true god class.</p>
<p>Although Han Sen wanted to hurry and play chess, Han Sen did not
underestimate Deep Abyss Knight. He still stayed vigilant.</p>
<p>Han Sen’s xenogeneic mode was almost invincible, but there were
many xenogeneics in the universe. They all had unbelievable powers.
If Han Sen encountered a strange power and fell into its tricks, he
would pay the price with his life. This was not a joke.</p>
<p>The intelligence of most xenogeneics was not too high. Even if
it was high, they would be low when it came to their emotional
intelligence. Han Sen and the xenogeneic had nothing to talk about,
so Han Sen gathered up power via his Return Empty Scabbard and
attacked.</p>
<p>The knife was pure power, but his xenogeneic power amplified its
strength to a force that exceeded true god class. A butterfly
xenogeneic at the same level stood no chance of trying to withstand
Han Sen’s power.</p>
<p>The Return Empty Scabbard had its own power to deal too. If an
ordinary butterfly xenogeneic was struck by Han Sen, it would end
up dead or injured.</p>
<p>The Deep Abyss Knight was very cold. His eyes were like black
holes. They were so deep that it was like they could absorb
light.</p>
<p>He did not dodge. The Deep Abyss Knight crossed his arms across
his chest. He was not planning on moving an inch. When the Return
Empty Scabbard got closer, the tentacles below his body moved. They
were going for Han Sen’s Return Empty Scabbard.</p>
<p>The tentacles struck the Return Empty Scabbard, but not a single
sound was made. The tentacles silently wrapped up the Return Empty
Scabbard. The suckers below the tentacles started to suck the
Return Empty Scabbard.</p>
<p>Han Sen’s expression changed. From what he had seen before, he
knew the Deep Abyss Knight was strong, but he couldn’t have such a
strong power. He used one tentacle to block his Return Empty
Scabbard’s slash. With a power like that, Han Sen believed Deep
Abyss Knight was a true god class.</p>
<p>Han Sen’s eyes looked cold. He was holding the Return Empty
Scabbard. He tried to pull it back. He saw the Return Empty
Scabbard flash with a purple light. No matter how hard Han Sen
tried, the Return Empty Scabbard did not move. It was sucked onto
the tentacles.</p>
<p>The Deep Abyss Knight’s arms were still crossed across his
chest. He coldly looked at Han Sen with a face of utter disdain and
said, “Stupid creature.”</p>
<p>Following his words, purple and black flames surged out of the
Deep Abyss Knight’s body. His entire body was like a demon crawling
out of purgatory. The tentacles holding the scabbard swung. They
pulled on Han Sen and the scabbard. At the same time, other
tentacles were wrapping up his body.</p>
<p>Han Sen was shocked. He had to let the scabbard go. He quickly
stumbled back and evaded the attacks of the lashing tentacles.</p>
<p>“How is that possible? How did the Deep Abyss Knight’s power
become so much stronger?” Han Sen asked with a frown. If he did not
know the geno god list fights could have people swapping position,
he would have started wondering whether or not it was the same Deep
Abyss Knight he had seen before. Its power was certainly
different.</p>
<p>It was not just Han Sen that was confused. Many elites who knew
Deep Abyss Knight were also in shock.</p>
<p>“Since when did the Deep Abyss Knight become so strong? With his
power now, it does not look like a dark element only.” The woman in
Sky Palace was shocked.</p>
<p>“It is weird.” Sky Palace Leader frowned.</p>
<p>In the Very High, Exquisite and Li Keer watched the scene. They
thought it was strange too. Li Keer said, “I thought Deep Abyss
Knight was a dark element being. Why is this dark knight suddenly
different? Will Dollar lose?”</p>
<p>“It looks like Deep Abyss Knight is stronger than Dollar,”
Exquisite coldly said. “Just one skill has disarmed him. He took
his treasure scabbard. I am afraid Dollar is going to lose this
round.”</p>
<p>When Li Keer heard that, she felt terrible. Although she had
been unsuccessful in making Dollar her silkworm, she still did not
want Dollar to lose.</p>
<p>On Empty Mountain, the green-haired beast looked confused.
“Weird. Why is that Deep Abyss Knight so strong. I fought Deep
Abyss Knight once, and he was not that strong.”</p>
<p>The woman nearby coldly looked at Deep Abyss Knight and said,
“In this world, whatever monster shows up, it does not matter.
Little Mountain Leader will defeat them. Empty Mountain will once
again be back on top.”</p>
<p>“You are right,” the green-haired beast said with a cocky look.
“Little Mountain Leader’s power is almost as good as the old
mountain leader. Swallowing a true god is not difficult for it.
Whether it’s Deep Abyss Knight or Dollar, whoever stands in Little
Mountain Leader’s way will end up dead.”</p>
<p>When Yisha saw that the Return Empty Scabbard had been stolen by
Deep Abyss Knight, she frowned. “What is Dollar doing?”</p>
<p>In the Extreme King garden, God stroked his jaw and said to
himself, “Was my hint not clear enough? He used Sky Armor God’s rib
bone to attack Sky Armor God. That is just giving up the ghost. You
just gave the god personality back. With Sky Armor God’s
personality, I do not think he will take the god personality and
run.”</p>
<p>Deep Abyss Knight swung his tentacles and brought the scabbard
next to him. Then, he let go of his arm. He used his right arm to
grab the Return Empty Scabbard. His eyes flashed with a weird
light.</p>
<p>Han Sen frowned and looked at Deep Abyss Knight. He felt there
was something wrong. Deep Abyss Knight was releasing a presence
that felt the same as the Return Empty Scabbard.</p>
<p>Deep Abyss Knight stroked the Return Empty Scabbard. He felt
extremely happy. His happiness could not be described. “My god
personality has finally been returned.”</p>
<p>After Deep Abyss Knight performed that action, the Return Empty
Scabbard’s light became brighter and brighter. It looked like the
flames on Deep Abyss Knight were connecting. They released a light
that blew into the sky.</p>
<p>At this time, even the elites who were watching could tell what
was happening. Deep Abyss Knight did not have strong enough power
to cause a reaction with the scabbard that would result in it
exploding so powerfully.</p>
<p>“This is true god class power,” the woman said with shock. “Did
Deep Abyss Knight become a true god?”</p>
<p>“No, that is not a true god. He is not the real Deep Abyss
Knight.” Sky Palace Leader’s eyes were icy. He said, “He is a God
Spirit that descended.”</p>
