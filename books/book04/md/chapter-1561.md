  “What do you want?” Han Sen looked at Luo Yu, frowning.

Luo Yu curled his lips and said, “You want to go hunt some super creatures, right? Then, to respect Luo Lan, I’ll give you this chance.”

Han Sen was a bit surprised. He thought that Luo Yu meant him some harm, yet the man was inviting him to hunt super creatures. The super creatures must have been the ones discovered by Jia Shidao.

“Is that really necessary?” Han Sen looked at Luo Yu, his expression veiled. He had some idea of what Luo Yu intended.

“Are you too chicken to go?” said Luo Yu, disrespectfully.

“Of course I can go with you, but I’ll get half the super creatures I hunt.” Han Sen didn’t care much about what Luo Yu thought. If he could get life geno essences, he would totally go.

“No problem, as long as you can bring them down,” Luo Yu promised him easily.

“When shall we go?” Han Sen didn’t want to say anything more.

“Tomorrow,” said Luo Yu.

“Okay,” answered Han Sen. He then left the courtyard and went to meet Little Silver.

“Second brother, we tried so hard to find common ground with Jia Shidao and get rid of Han Sen. Why are we bringing him now?” asked Luo Hui.

Luo Yu said coldly, “I was going to kick him out before because I wanted to show him the power of our family, and I’m bringing him now to show him our power again. And I also want to show our great-grandfather that there are talents in our family. He’s just not giving us a chance.”

“That’s right. What was our great-grandfather thinking? Why is he using the Han’s instead of us?” muttered Luo Hui.

Luo Haitang’s choice had upset many from the Luo’s family. They were in no position to judge his decision, but none of them were happy about it. Now that they had finally met Han Sen, they wanted to perform well in front of Luo Haitang. They wanted Luo Haitang to know that they were better than Han Sen.

Luo Yu didn’t think he was any worse than Han Sen. Han Sen might have been the first Super Aristocrat in the Alliance, but to them, that was only a joke.

With the help of Luo Haitang, the Luo’s had already gained super genes, but because of the rules of the Luo family, they didn’t publicize it.

Luo Li could only smile inside as she listened to Luo Yu rant. She knew Luo Yu and Luo Hui extremely well.

They indeed had some power, but neither of them was exceptional, and with the status of Luo Haitang in Godslayer Shelter, they had been spoiled since the day they were born. Even other demigods in the Alliance had to pay them so much respect that they thought they were the most powerful demigods in existence other than Luo Haitang and several other great beings. They despised ordinary demigods with all their hearts, and they overestimated themselves.

The next day, Han Sen took Little Silver to the square of Godslayer Shelter and found Luo Yu already standing there.

Jia Shidao was also there, and he was surprised to see Han Sen. He pretended to smile. “What a coincidence, Brother Han.”

“Not a coincidence. I called him, and he’ll be following us this time,” said Luo Yu.

Jia Shidao coughed, feeling awkward. He had no idea what Luo Yu was thinking. It had been Luo Yu who asked Jia Shidao to kick Han Sen out, yet now the man had asked Han Sen to come with them.

Luo Yu took Han Sen to see several creatures, but he didn’t say much. After all, it was not an easy job to domesticate powerful creatures. There were only a few super creatures in Godslayer Shelter, besides, even those super creatures in the shelter wouldn’t let them drive them like this.

It was way more difficult to enslave super creatures than to kill them. Han Sen’s super creatures were basically raised by him when they were only children. Mature ones like the little red horse wouldn’t be as obedient as those like Little Silver, and it was difficult to manipulate them.

Everyone traveled under Jia Shidao’s guidance, and Luo Li also followed them. Her fighting power wasn’t great, as she only had a gemstone geno core. Luo Yu and Luo Hui weren’t counting on her help; they just took her because they wanted her to be a witness.

Luo Li wasn’t a Luo by blood, but she was responsible for assisting Luo Haitang with mundane tasks, so she spent more time with Luo Haitang than they did. If Luo Li saw it, that meant Luo Haitang also saw it.

Luo Yu and Luo Hui didn’t make a single attack on their way. When they ran into groups of creatures, the demigods following them took care of the threat. Those demigods had attached themselves to the Luo’s, but they didn’t have the blood of the Luo’s, so they couldn’t practice the Falsified-Sky Sutra.

After more than four days, they finally arrived at the dune Jia Shidao had talked about.

The ground was covered in white sand, and Han Sen could see some random green shadows in the distance. They were enormous, bulbous cacti.

Jia Shidao pointed at those cacti and said, “Be careful, everyone. The cacti aren’t plants; they’re creatures. The super creatures that I talked about are the cacti at the heart of this dune.”

“What kind of power do these cacti have?” asked Luo Yu.

Jia Shidao wasn’t willing to say anything before they arrived, so Luo Yu didn’t know any more than Han Sen.

Jia Shidao found no reason to conceal it anymore. He pointed at the cactus closest to them and said, “Those cacti aren’t able to move, but they can spew their thorns out. The thorns can travel more than half a mile, so we need to be careful.”

“No worries.” Luo Yu summoned a beast soul shield, and he walked toward one of the cacti.

When they were only a thousand feet away from the cactus, it noticed Luo Yu. All of a sudden, thorns that were inches long spewed out. There were at least a hundred of them.

However, those thorns weren’t able to pierce through Luo Yu’s shield. The shield warded off everything, while Luo Yu kept marching toward the cactus. The cactus seemed to have endless thorns. After it finished firing the first round of thorns, they immediately grew back and started to spew out again.

However, none of the thorns were very strong, so the shield was able to ward them off. Luo Yu ran up to the cactus and slashed it in half.

“It is a creature, but it’s only a mutant creature. Jia Shidao, are you sure there are cacti at the super level?” Luo Yu asked Jia Shidao after killing the cactus.

“There are, definitely. I accidentally got in here before, and I saw a cactus made of gold, and that’s at sacred blood level. There’s another one that looks like a crystal pillar, and that’s definitely a super creature,” said Jia Shidao.

“Then let’s keep going.” Luo Yu looked farther into the dune, then led the way with his shield.
