    <p>&#8220;Die?&#8221; Han Sen looked at the woman with shock.</p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Follow me.&#8221; The woman gestured for Han Sen and Zero to
      accompany her, then she turned around and ventured deeper into the forest.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen and Zero looked at each other, then decided to go with her. They
      hadn&#8217;t been walking too long when they came to a clearing with a few
      tents and other living amenities. There were a few other people there too,
      sunbathing in the pleasant afternoon sunshine.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen and Zero&#8217;s arrival roused their attention. Those who were
      lying down stood up, and others came out from their tents.
    </p>

    <p>
      There were a dozen humans there, and judging from their apparel and the
      state of their tents, they must have been there for quite some time.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;It is lucky I found you. If I hadn&#8217;t, you&#8217;d be dead
      right now, with no clue as to how your death had come about.&#8221; Back
      in the camp, the woman seemed to be a touch calmer. &#8220;This place is
      safe, so pitch a tent and rest a while.&#8221;
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen looked at the woman and said, &#8220;Why? What&#8217;s going
      on?&#8221;
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;You guys know this is the Dark Haunted Forest, don&#8217;t
      you?&#8221; she asked, with shock. The others in the camp eyed Han Sen and
      his fellows curiously.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen shook his head and said, &#8220;I have traveled a great distance.
      I didn&#8217;t suspect this forest to have any form of notoriety.&#8221;
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Oh, you poor and unfortunate people. Most people who wander into
      this forest at unawares can never find a way out.&#8221; The woman let out
      a lamenting sigh.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Never find a way out?&#8221; Han Sen was shocked at hearing what
      the woman told him. He did not believe a forest could trap him and prevent
      his leaving.
    </p>

    <p>
      If he could not walk out, he could at least fly. Regardless of how creepy
      this place was, it would be impossible for a forest to trap a creature
      with wings.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;You really have no idea what you&#8217;ve stumbled into, do you?
      You both look young, and for you both to enter this place and subject
      yourself to this fate is a crying shame, I tell you. A crying
      shame!&#8221; Another person in camp had become quite outspoken.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Can someone cut the nonsense and tell it to me straight? What is
      going on here?&#8221; Han Sen passed out some alcohol and food to the
      people, retrieved from the satchels on Golden Growler.
    </p>

    <p>
      When the people saw the alcohol and food, they looked shocked. They ran
      over to the items and devoured them as quickly as they could, as if they
      hadn&#8217;t eaten in a thousand years.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Brother, do you have cigarettes?&#8221; a middle-aged man asked Han
      Sen.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Yes, as a matter of fact. I do.&#8221; Han Sen pulled out a pack of
      cigarettes from his pocket and tossed them over to the middle-aged man,
      who looked to be in absolute shock.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;You should put these away and cherish them. You&#8217;re going to
      be here for a long time.&#8221; When the woman saw how generous Han Sen
      was being, she couldn&#8217;t help but present a wry smile.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen understood what she was implying, but he did not believe
      he&#8217;d be trapped in the forest as they had been. He smiled and asked
      for the people there to tell him all they could about the place.
    </p>

    <p>
      The people there were harmless, and after receiving the goods from Han
      Sen, they passionately relayed as many of the tales and stories about the
      place as they could.
    </p>

    <p>
      Like Han Sen, they had mistakenly ventured into the Dark Haunted Forest.
      They hadn&#8217;t come together, but one at a time. Whatever venture led
      them to the forest had been their last, and they had all been stuck there
      ever since.
    </p>

    <p>
      The woman who invited them over, near the big tree, was the most recent
      addition to the growing community. Her name was Liu Fang, and she had
      gotten lost in the forest two years before Han Sen&#8217;s arrival.
    </p>

    <p>
      Liu Fang was a botanist. Her job in the Alliance was associated with the
      forest, and she had a great interest in the Dark Haunted Trees that grew
      there.
    </p>

    <p>
      She went there wanting to learn more about them, but walking a mere ten
      meters into the forest to collect a sample was enough to prevent her from
      leaving. She couldn&#8217;t escape and suddenly, the forest stretched out
      for miles around in every direction. After a while of traveling, she too
      stumbled across this camp.
    </p>

    <p>
      The others had a similar fate befall them. Some entered by mistake,
      whereas others entered the forest in pursuit of adventure. Everyone who
      hadn&#8217;t somehow ended up dead, found themselves at this camp.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;What is so dangerous about this place? Those fireflies are
      harmless, aren&#8217;t they?&#8221; Han Sen felt compelled to ask.
    </p>

    <p>
      Liu Fang, with another wry smile, responded, &#8220;The Dark Haunted
      Forest is not aggressive in itself. The real danger comes from the Dark
      Haunted Trees.&#8221;
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Are you saying those trees are a danger?&#8221; Han Sen eyed the
      trees that were all about, and didn&#8217;t notice anything particularly
      dangerous.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;We were wondering if the trees were creatures, and the bugs were
      merely an extension of their bodies.&#8221; Liu Fang paused after saying
      this, and then continued, &#8220;You probably haven&#8217;t noticed this
      yet, but if you stay near the trees for a while, you will age much faster.
      In three months, you can die from old age!&#8221;
    </p>

    <p>&#8220;Really?&#8221; Han Sen frowned.</p>

    <p>
      &#8220;You are lucky that Little Fang brought you here. If you walk within
      a kilometer of that big tree, you can die in less than three hours.
      It&#8217;s a crying shame!&#8221; the man called Wang Jiangang said.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Thank you, if that&#8217;s the case.&#8221; Han Sen appreciated
      what she did for him. He might have been indestructible when going up
      against physical threats in the Second God&#8217;s Sanctuary now, but
      there was no guarantee of survival against such creepy works.
    </p>

    <p>
      Had he not been informed of the danger, he would have continued to blindly
      walk into the tree&#8217;s entrapment.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;You are welcome.&#8221; Liu Fang, after another wry smile,
      continued her dialogue. &#8220;I came here with two friends. They stayed
      in proximity to the Dark Haunted Tree King for one hour, and after that,
      they looked to be about two hundred years old. Then, they died of old age.
      Just remember; do not get close to the Tree King—it&#8217;ll affect your
      body quite quickly.&#8221;
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;If it is not necessary, do not even venture beyond the outskirts of
      this camp. It&#8217;ll be a crying shame, if you do. These ordinary trees
      can still affect you, it is just difficult for you to tell,&#8221; Wang
      Jiangang said.
    </p>

    <p>&#8220;Can&#8217;t I just fly away?&#8221; Han Sen asked.</p>

    <p>
      &#8220;You can&#8217;t. This forest is endless, and whether you try to
      escape by foot or by wings, you cannot leave. It&#8217;s a crying
      shame.&#8221; Wang Jiangang smiled wryly, and continued to say, &#8220;I
      came to this place with beast soul wings myself. If these wings could
      deliver me to safety, I wouldn&#8217;t still be here!&#8221;
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen frowned and asked, &#8220;Have you tried cutting down the Dark
      Haunted Trees?&#8221;
    </p>

    <p>
      Liu Fang answered, &#8220;You can&#8217;t do that, either. If you cut
      them, they release a gas of some sort. It makes you grow older even
      faster. The camp in this meadow is the only place that is free from those
      wretched trees. And what&#8217;s more, even if you do unearth the tree and
      destroy its roots, it&#8217;ll magically restore itself within a few
      days.&#8221;
