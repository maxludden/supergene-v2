    <p>
      Han Sen was shocked as a burning sensation overwhelmed his insides. His
      kidneys were sizzling with heat, and it felt as if they had become two
      fireballs ricocheting around his body. Han Sen did not feel good.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Damn it! Why are you coming here at this time?&#8221; Han Sen did
      not have the willpower necessary to suppress the riot that was going on
      inside him.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen was in a trance. He couldn&#8217;t hear who it was outside or what
      the feminine voice was talking about. But regardless, he did not need to
      listen because Han Sen could guess who it was.
    </p>

    <p>
      Visitors to his room were infrequent, as it was something few would dare
      to do. It was only on the odd occasion that Yang Manli would come to visit
      him, when there were important matters to discuss. Aside from her, there
      was no one else.
    </p>

    <p>
      Thinking about Yang Manli&#8217;s thick, white legs, Han Sen felt his
      brain start to implode. He couldn&#8217;t take his mind off those
      delicious legs, and he wanted nothing more than to kick the door down and
      hop onto her.
    </p>

    <p>
      He used everything he had to suppress his lust and double-timed it on the
      Jade-Sun Force. He was going to do his best to wait this desire out.
    </p>

    <p>
      In the Second God&#8217;s Sanctuary, unlike the First God&#8217;s
      Sanctuary, anyone could enter another person&#8217;s room. But Yang Manli
      was not the sort of person to boorishly march into someone else&#8217;s
      room, so Han Sen was not concerned about a possible intrusion.
    </p>

    <p>
      If he was able to avoid seeing her, then Han Sen was of firm faith that he
      could beat this lusty force that was consuming him.
    </p>

    <p>
      But Han Sen&#8217;s heart suffered a shock quite quickly when he heard the
      door open.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Holy smokes! Yang Manli, I thought you were a reserved person. What
      is going on with you today?&#8221; Han Sen&#8217;s mind was scrambled like
      an egg, and his heart was ablaze.
    </p>

    <p>
      He heard the footsteps of a woman tread across his room. Although Han Sen
      was forcing his eyes closed, when he heard her voice, the resolve of his
      will crumbled to the machinations of lust. The image of a woman&#8217;s
      beautiful naked body was omnipresent, layered across all of his thoughts.
    </p>

    <p>
      As he tried to suppress the carnal desires, his face started turning red.
      Then his nose began bleeding.
    </p>

    <p>
      The woman was walking closer and closer to Han Sen, which almost made him
      scream out and call for aid. The effects of the red mushroom were too
      powerful. Zhu Ting was known to possess a strong will, but even he was
      eager to jump on top of a man for release. Given that, you might imagine
      the power of this mushroom.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen did not dare open his mouth or eyes. He was afraid that if he
      started talking, or even opened his eyes to look, his mind would forfeit
      all control to the lust that was attempting to conquer his mind.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Leave. Although I enjoy sleeping with women, I will only do it with
      the woman I love. I&#8217;m not entirely against consuming pills for added
      excitement, but shouldn&#8217;t that be a woman&#8217;s job? How can I eat
      them and suddenly be all lusty? Leave. Leave. Get out of here! Get out of
      here, Yang Manli!&#8221; Han Sen&#8217;s heart was encouraging itself to
      not give in, despite the rebellion of his mind.
    </p>

    <p>
      But the woman continued to approach Han Sen, having seemed to discover
      that something was not quite right with Han Sen&#8217;s behavior. She
      walked in front of Han Sen, trying to get a look at him.
    </p>

    <p>
      The woman was drawing extremely near, and Han Sen could smell her. It was
      like his entire body was on fire and his nose was gushing like a fountain.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen was fighting the desire to open his eyes, and he bit down on his
      teeth and kept them shut. He bit on his own tongue until it bled, hoping
      the addition of pain might help him beat back the lust. Blood dripped from
      his lips.
    </p>

    <p>
      The woman furrowed her brow, believing something had gone wrong with Han
      Sen&#8217;s training. She suddenly thought that her uninvited entry was
      the catalyst for this apparent mishap of practice.
    </p>

    <p>
      The woman bent over and reached out her hand to feel for Han Sen&#8217;s
      pulse on his neck. She seemed eager to find out what had happened to Han
      Sen.
    </p>

    <p>
      But when her delicate fingers touched Han Sen&#8217;s neck, the floodgates
      of his mind were lost. It felt as if the fingers were bringing a fire, and
      it made Han Sen open his eyes.
    </p>

    <p>
      A beautiful woman stood before him, and her body was incredibly refined.
      Her height was almost the same as Han Sen. She was wearing a tight white
      battlesuit. The curvatures of her thick, long legs, bubble butt, and big
      boobies were highlighted in the suit, perfectly sculptured, angled and
      curved to catch the attention of everyone, and get their hearts racing.
    </p>

    <p>
      Her delicate face was as cold as it was elegant. It was the face of
      someone who was difficult to get close with.
    </p>

    <p>
      The woman was directly in front of Han Sen, and her lips opened as if to
      say something.
    </p>

    <p>
      But at this time, Han Sen couldn&#8217;t hear a single thing. Although
      this woman did not look like Yang Manli, she was even more attractive,
      with a body and personality Han Sen favored even more. Han Sen lost all
      self-control.
    </p>

    <p>
      An aura of utter evil shone in Han Sen&#8217;s eyes. He reached out his
      hands and tried to grab the woman.
    </p>

    <p>
      The distance was great enough that she was able to take a graceful step
      back to avoid his lecherous hands.
    </p>

    <p>
      The woman&#8217;s face did not change. She just looked at Han Sen with the
      strangest of stares.
    </p>

    <p>
      But over the next second, her face warped. She could not believe Han Sen
      was coming after her.
    </p>

    <p>
      The woman thought it would be impossible for him to do so, but he did. It
      wasn&#8217;t long before her back was against a wall and there was nowhere
      else for her to go.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen blocked her every exit, and it was impossible for her to run away
      now. The woman became incredibly angry in her shock. She reached her hand
      out to hit Han Sen, but then quickly refrained. She knew she had disturbed
      his training and caused this predicament. Right now, his eyes were blood
      red, which more than suggested something was wrong. She pulled back her
      fist.
    </p>

    <p>
      As soon as she hesitated, Han Sen grabbed on to the woman&#8217;s
      battlesuit. Within moments, the battlesuit that had been designed to
      withstand bullets was ripped apart by Han Sen&#8217;s lust-fuelled hands.
      Her succulent pair of big white breasts were now on full display in front
      of him.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen threw himself on to the woman and pushed her against the wall. One
      hand was clutched one of her giant boobs, which one hand could never hope
      to hold in its entirety, and his other hand reached down to squeeze her
      firm, bubbly butt. Han Sen then brought down his lips to seal her own.
    </p>

    <p>
      The woman opened her eyes wide, and her body froze. Within just a few
      seconds, her curvy, voluptuous body had been grabbed and touched all over
      by Han Sen.
    </p>

    <p>
      A second later, her eyes were filled with the chaos-fire of hatred, and
      she looked at Han Sen a murderous eye. It was as if her entire body had
      entered berserk mode. Her body seemed to emit a purple light, and she took
      on the shape of a fairy.
    </p>

    <p>Pang!</p>

    <p>
      A walloping knee drilled its way into Han Sen&#8217;s stomach, which sent
      the horny baboon flying across the room. Then the woman jumped up and
      struck Han Sen with her battleaxe-like legs while he was still airborne.
    </p>

    <p>Before he could even hit the ground, she kicked him sideways again.</p>

    <p>Pang! Pang! Pang!</p>

    <p>
      The beautiful legs had become frightening weapons that struck Han Sen
      around thirty times. And for the entire time he was beaten up, right,
      left, and even down, Han Sen did not touch the ground.
    </p>

    <p>Her exposed breasts jumped and jiggled with every kick.</p>

    <p>
      The woman knew that there was something wrong with Han Sen, however, which
      helped to calm her down somewhat. So, she used her hands to try to conceal
      her wobbling, jelly breasts.
