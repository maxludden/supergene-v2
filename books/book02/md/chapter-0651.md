  Lei Heng Wu, the person that Wang Yuhang mentioned, was in the shelter on the opposite side of the Devil's Mountain. All they would have to do was cross those perilous mountains to find him.

But Han Sen decided to return to the Alliance first, so he could adequately prepare for the journey. Upon going back, Han Sen looked at his communicator and noticed that he had received many unanswered calls and messages.

There were a few from Ji Yanran, Tang Zhen Liu, and Huangfu Ping Qing – all acquaintances of his.

Han Sen called them back one by one, and the subject of each call was Ji Qing having killed a super creature. It was an event that shocked every high-rank member of the Alliance who knew about it. It hadn't yet been announced to the public, however.

Han Sen did not reply directly to Ji Yanran's message and instead went to see her at her office.

Ji Yanran told Han Sen that Ji Qing did indeed slay a super creature. Although the feat was achieved with the aid of an additional three hundred evolvers, it was she who delivered the final blow. The super creature did not leave behind a body, only a Life Geno essence.

Han Sen already knew that most super creatures wouldn't leave behind a corpse. Only a few of them would, and this was one of the many traits that made the existence of super creatures so intriguing.

Just like Golden Roarer and young Golden Roarers, they were special. The young Golden Roarer became a beast soul, different to all other beast souls.

A normal riding beast soul, even if it was a super creature beast soul, would not be aggressive. But the young Golden Roarer was, which was different to all other mounts.

Han Sen did not know why super creatures had such varying traits and personalities, and it was something he thought about every day, in some capacity.

Now, the whole world was still discussing the existence of super creatures. But Han Sen knew this was just the beginning, and if the Alliance were to make the announcement, things would only get crazier and crazier.

Although Ji Yanran did not tell him exactly, Han Sen knew that the Ji family would announce the news. They would proudly proclaim that the Ji family were the first to ever slay a super creature, and that it would be written down in history. It would be a great help for Ji Ruozhen when he asserted his position as leader of the Alliance.

Although Ji Ruozhen would gain numerous other benefits from this event, it practically guaranteed his election. It was a most honorable thing, after all.

Before Han Sen returned to the shelter, he called Zhang Danfeng and talked for a while, too.

Zhang Danfeng had almost managed to max out his sacred geno point level. Han Sen told him about super geno points so he could prepare for more progression in the future.

Han Sen was no stranger to the road that wound its way up and over the Devil's Mountain. It wasn't likely bad things would occur on his passage, but just in case, he brought Zero and the silver fox with him.

After all, Wang Yuhang was also coming. God knows what would happen with him in tow, especially here on the Devil's Mountain. It was a mystic range, shrouded in a fog of unanswered mysteries and the unknown. It was said many terrifying monsters lurked in the crevices and valleys, occupying the lesser-tread trails in anticipation of any unfortunate ramblers.

They exercised much caution along the way, and Wang Yuhang said the less he tried to aggro monsters, the less likely they were to suffer bad luck.

With the silver fox there, they hadn't met a single creature. And so far, Wang Yuhang's miserable luck had yet to sour their course.

Zero was clad in a white battlesuit, holding the silver fox. She looked really cute, and even Wang Yuhang said she was the most adorable girl he had ever laid his insatiable eyes upon.

Han Sen quickly pulled Wang Yuhang away from her; the last thing he wanted was his creepy uncle getting close with Zero.

They had reached the other side of the mountain when Wang Yuhang took the lead, bringing them to Devil's Shelter. There, they met with Lei Heng Wu who had just arrived, himself.

"Old Lei!" Wang Yuhang opened the door to the man's room and started waving to a burly old man who looked like a jaded tower built of steel.

"Yuhang, why are you here?" The strong man, after seeing Wang Yuhang, changed his initial look of displeasure to one of forced happiness.

"Old Lei, I have come here to look after you. I have recently become a member of a most talented team that is preparing to hunt down super creatures," Wang Yuhang explained, with great enthusiasm drenching every syllable.

Lei Heng Wu looked surprised. Not about the super creatures, though. He looked at Wang Yuhang with eyes of disbelief and asked, "You? You joined a team that tasks itself with hunting super creatures?"

Everyone who had ever met Wang Yuhang quickly met the bad luck that followed him, as well. To hunt with Wang Yuhang was almost a guarantee of terrible things happening. Other people had actually taken advantage of his bad luck as well, to attract certain monsters. But the problem was, most – if not all – the creatures he attracted were too strong for any ordinary team to handle. As such, every hunt alongside the man resulted in absolute disaster. With an almost certain chance of losing everything each time, no one dared hunt with the man anymore.

"Yes! And allow me to wax lyrical in regards to the team I have joined, for it is quite possibly composed of the most talented warriors to be found in these lands and beyond. I have come here in the hopes of inviting you to join our ranks, on account of us being old friends. If you join us, we are sure to become the first team that kills a super creature here in the Second Shelter." Wang Yuhang was selling the team as well as anyone could.

"Whose team did you join? It cannot be one from your Wang family, surely." Lei Heng Wu seemed to be convinced by what Wang Yuhang had told him. After all, a team that was willing to accept a man like Wang Yuhang had to be quite remarkable.

"Come! Allow me to introduce you to Mister Bossman Han Sen. He is incredible! He can slay super creatures all by himself. If the super creature we fought had not escaped, we would have been the first to slay one and rob Ji Qing of her snobbish thunder!" Wang Yuhang did not bluff at all about this statement.

"Han Sen?" Lei Heng Wu frowned as if he was straining his mind trying to recall if he had ever heard of this person.

"There is no need to think that hard! Ji Ruozhen is Han Sen's father-in-law." Wang Yuhang could see his interest suddenly begin to wane, so he blinked to prompt Han Sen into saying something.

Lei Heng Wu's face suddenly lit up in surprise. After Wang Yuhang had introduced them both, Lei Heng Wu invited them all into the room proper so they could discuss the team in greater detail.

"Leader Han, I am curious to know if there are any other prestigious members of fame or notoriety on your team." After Lei Heng Wu unlocked his gene lock, he didn't want to join any team, guild, or faction right away. He wanted to wait and join a band of closer, more powerful individuals.

If Han Sen was Ji Ruozhen's son-in-law, Lei Heng Wu considered him a family member of the Ji family no matter which way it was cut.

The Ji family already had Ji Qing, a certified super creature slayer. Although that was in the First Shelter, it must have still been quite the feat and show of talent. As such, he wouldn't decline the proposition of being invited onto a team of the Ji family.

"We do not have a great many members in our ranks just yet, but those that we do have are good. We don't just accept anyone onto our team, either. To join us in our hunts, we only consider the best of the best. In fact, Bossman is already in the process of enlisting a few other high-ranking elites in the Second Shelter. You've heard of the Queen, yes? Bossman pretty much has her locked in." Wang Yuhang spoke quickly, as he was afraid Han Sen would be quick to tell the truth. If Han Sen did, Lei Heng Wu would shoot down their request in flames.

"Really? The Queen is joining your team?" Lei Heng Wu asked, with wide-open eyes that kept jumping between Han Sen and Wang Yuhang.

"This strange uncle isn't always honest, by the looks of things." Han Sen smiled and did not say anything further. He had only mentioned the Queen's name once and there was no guarantee she would be willing to join. Wang Yuhang was skipping ahead and using this possibility as leverage.

"Of course I'm not lying! Old Lei, you assuredly know how much I value our relationship. Am I the sort of person who would be willing to lie to you?" Wang Yuhang bore a righteous face as he said this.
