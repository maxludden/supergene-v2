<h2>Retreat</h2>
<h3>Chapter 2582</h3>

<p>The monster was like a fighting machine. It could rotate 360
degrees in a moment, and it could release tentacles from any part
of its body. The tentacles could weave themselves together to
create whatever weapon or defense best suited the needs of its
fight.</p>
<p>The scariest thing about it was that the tentacles were deified
class. And the whole composition of the beast had a strong life
power. No matter how many times it was struck, it could recompose
itself. Facing such an opponent, Han Sen and the little red bird
weren’t sure what to do.</p>
<p>Han Sen and the bird were attacking the monster together, but
they were at a disadvantage.</p>
<p>“Real deified xenogeneics are scary. Those fake deified
xenogeneics in the core area are nothing compared to this.” Han Sen
was shocked. He couldn’t think of a way in which they could defeat
this foe. An idea occurred to him, and he summoned his Six Core
Snake Bow. He didn’t have any deified arrows for it, so he had to
summon a King class arrow beast soul. He placed the arrow on the
Six Core Snake Bow and pulled the string.</p>
<p>Whoosh!</p>
<p>The moment Han Sen let the arrow fly, the Six Core Snake Bow’s
six wheels spun. The arrow was imbued with a strange power, and it
immediately disappeared.</p>
<p>When the arrow appeared again, it was in front of the monster.
It soared right into the eye upon the monster’s forehead.</p>
<p>“The Six Core Snake Bow gives space power to the arrows it
shoots!” Han Sen realized with pleasure.</p>
<p>That meant every arrow the Six Core Snake Bow fired would
teleport. That was better than Han Sen’s skill for drilling arrows.
When people were shot by an arrow from this bow, they wouldn’t be
able to trace its path toward them.</p>
<p>Plus, Han Sen was also able to tell that the arrow could tear
through the fabric of space. That was the power the Six Core Snake
Bow could imbue upon the projectiles he used with it.</p>
<p>The King class beast soul arrow received enough of a buff from
the Six Core Snake Bow to pierce through the monster’s eye. Half
the arrow embedded itself firmly in the eye, and blood sprayed out
around it.</p>
<p>“This is a nice bow,” Han Sen thought happily. The bow’s power
was perfect for Han Sen.</p>
<p>But Han Sen didn’t stay happy for long. Tentacles grew from the
injured monster’s eye. The tentacles wrapped around the beast soul
arrow and removed the power Han Sen had given to the projectile.
Then the monster pulled out the beast soul arrow and cracked
it.</p>
<p>That injured eye was covered by tentacles and swiftly
healed.</p>
<p>“Is the monster’s entire body made of silk?” Han Sen
wondered.</p>
<p>Quickly, Han Sen’s guess was confirmed. He used his Six Core
Snake Bow to strike the monster’s body. The same result was
achieved. No matter where Han Sen fired, tentacles would appear and
patch up the monster in no time at all.</p>
<p>“I believe I can kill you.” Han Sen added his Turtle spell to
the arrow in a bid to slow the beast down.</p>
<p>The Turtle skill was applied to the monster. It managed to make
the monster’s body slower, but Han Sen was soon surprised to learn
that the monster could shed the parts of its body that contained
Turtle. That removed the effects of the spell from the greater mass
of the beast.</p>
<p>Han Sen tried to apply the Turtle symbol in many different ways,
but ultimately, it was ineffective. The monster was like a gecko
that could keep reproducing its tail. This creature could cut off
any part of its body to no negative effect.</p>
<p>“This guy is more disgusting than Barr,” Han Sen said.</p>
<p>The little red bird and Han Sen didn’t know what to do against
the monster. The monster kept using its tentacles to form all sorts
of different weapons to attack them. Some of its attacks changed
weapons unexpectedly at the last moment.</p>
<p>It could make knives, spears, swords, and sticks. It could also
make shields and fists. The monster was like an invincible killing
machine. It was giving Han Sen and the little red bird a
headache.</p>
<p>Gu Qingcheng and the others were helping the white tiger tackle
all the smaller snakes, but things weren’t going so well for them
either. More and more of those weird snakes slithered up onto the
island. Their numbers were growing. Whenever the defenders killed
one snake, two more took its place. Half the island was now wholly
swarmed by the snakes.</p>
<p>The white tiger suddenly meowed to the sky. Its cry was directed
at Han Sen.</p>
<p>Han Sen didn’t understand what the white tiger wanted. The white
tiger jumped and drilled into the ground. When it reappeared, it
was one hundred miles away. Then, it called to Han Sen again.</p>
<p>Han Sen now understood. It wanted Han Sen to follow it.</p>
<p>Although Han Sen didn’t understand what the white tiger was
thinking, he knew that fighting like this was futile. Even if he
and the little red bird could survive, Fang Qing Yu and the others
would likely be killed.</p>
<p>“Bao’er, you drive! Follow it and let’s go.” Han Sen threw
Bao’er into the white whale.</p>
<p>Bao’er dropped through the air. When the ground came near, she
flipped and landed softly upon the white whale. She hurried inside
and fired it up, then piloted it toward the white tiger.</p>
<p>Gu Qingcheng and the others fell back to the white whale as
well. Han Sen and the little red bird kept fighting as they made
their retreat. They wouldn’t allow the monster a chance to attack
the white whale.</p>
<p>The group of snakes was like a black ocean beneath the white
whale. They destroyed everything in sight. The fairytale-like
mushroom island was turned into a ruined, rocky crag.</p>
<p>Han Sen and the little red bird flew a great distance away from
the monster, but it no longer seemed to be going after them. It
started to gorge on the mushrooms now that it could do so
uninterrupted.</p>
<p>Han Sen and the little red bird no longer provoked it. They flew
next to the white whale to protect it. And as they did, they all
proceeded to follow the white tiger.</p>
<p>Their situation was a dire one. Food was now going to be a
problem. The scariest thing was that the snakes and the monster
were both issues that they had no idea how to solve.</p>
<p>The white whale flew over the island. As they moved beyond the
snakes, they saw the mushroom forest behind them get consumed.</p>
<p>Suddenly, Han Sen’s face grew pale as he looked at one snake
among the writhing mass. After eating a lot of mushrooms, its body
became larger. It swelled to ten times its previous size, and its
body started to grow tentacles. It was like a smaller version of
that goliath monster.</p>
<p>“They aren’t snakes. They’re baby versions of that big one,” Han
Sen and the others now understood. They looked quite glum.</p>
<p>One monster was hard enough to deal with. If they all became
monsters, it would be disastrous.</p>
<p>And as everyone was trying to process the new information, a few
more of the snakes grew bigger. They became just like the monster
that was covered in tentacles. But their auras didn’t reach the
horrifying level of the largest one just yet. They were King class,
most likely, and almost as good as a half-deified.</p>
<p>“Is this a joke?” one the pirates mumbled in shock.</p>
<p>No one answered him, and that was because no one knew what it
was.</p>
<p>The white tiger kept running through the mushroom forest, but if
the white whale started to lag, it would stop and roar up at them.
It went back to running when they caught up. It was like it was
leading them someplace.</p>
