<h3>Chapter 2527</h3>

<p>Han Sen and Li Keer flew through space together, but the bronze
furnace lagged some distance behind them. It still wasn’t willing
to come anywhere close to Li Keer.</p>
<p>If Li Keer was willing to lead, Han Sen had no reason to reject
her offer. If she could find deified xenogeneics, Han Sen wouldn’t
mind helping her slay the bronze tripod.</p>
<p>Han Sen still wasn’t fond of Li Keer’s personality, so he didn’t
talk to her all that much. But Li Keer was smart and talkative, and
Han Sen discovered that she even had a sense of humor. He found it
difficult to rectify her personality with how she had acted when
they first met.</p>
<p>Han Sen didn’t know that her attitude had actually changed.</p>
<p>When they first met, Li Keer had looked at Han Sen as if she was
far superior to him. It was like a human talking to a cow. Humans
normally wouldn’t bother talking to cows, because there was no
point in having a conversation with a being of such low
intelligence. They would just teach the cow what to do,
instead.</p>
<p>But ever since that bet, Li Keer had realized Han Sen wasn’t
just some lesser being. He was her equal, or perhaps he even
stronger, in some ways. Li Keer could no longer think of Han Sen as
some foolish creature.</p>
<p>But the blame couldn’t be put on Li Keer for her initial
assumptions. Across the entire universe, all beings with emotions
made similar assumptions about others that were not of their
species. Even humans did.</p>
<p>“There’s a deified xenogeneic that I saw not too long ago. It is
a wolf god. I don’t really know much about it, but I have heard
that he isn’t very strong compared to most of the deified
xenogeneics in the core area.” Li Keer continued to fly forward as
she gave Han Sen the low down on the deified xenogeneic.</p>
<p>As she spoke, Li Keer was thinking, “I’m not lying; the wolf god
really isn’t that strong compared to most deified xenogeneics in
the core area. It can be considered medium-low. But it does have a
wolf god area. That area not only summons a wolf pack, but it also
summons clones of the wolf god. A whole horde of wolf god clones
will be summoned, and they aren’t much weaker than the wolf god
itself. Let’s see how you deal with an opponent like this.”</p>
<p>Li Keer wasn’t doing this to harm Han Sen, but to see how he
handled himself in danger. When he did fall into trouble, she would
swoop in and help. She would save him and impress him with her
skill at the same time. Then, Han Sen would more willingly obey
her. That way, she could take him on as her silkworm.</p>
<p>Following Li Keer’s lead, Han Sen flew down toward a planet. Li
Keer pointed in the direction of a mountain and said, “I saw the
wolf god on that mountain. I’m too weak to fight it, so I’m
certainly not going over there.”</p>
<p>“Okay. Wait here, then. If there is a deified xenogeneic, I will
help you eliminate the core bronze tripod whether or not I manage
to kill this deified,” Han Sen said.</p>
<p>“I will await your good news,” Li Keer said with a smile.</p>
<p>Han Sen nodded and flew toward the mountain. The bronze furnace
remained behind at Han Sen’s request. It didn’t head for the same
mountain as him.</p>
<p>Li Keer’s eyes flickered. She was far away from the mountain,
but she could see all the flowers and forests that littered the
landscape.</p>
<p>Quickly, Li Keer’s senses detected the wolf god on that
mountain. It was different from ordinary wolves. The wolf god lived
alone, and its body wasn’t very big. It was barely bigger than an
ordinary wolf.</p>
<p>The wolf was colored grey with a single black line running
across its coat, but its fur wasn’t ordinary. It was made of some
weird metal. The metallic fur was smooth, and it didn’t affect the
creature’s mobility.</p>
<p>As Li Keer’s watched, Han Sen quickly found the wolf god. The
wolf god was very territorial, and Han Sen had only just stepped
into the valley when the wolf god revealed itself. Its hair
straightened up, and its green wolf eyes peered down on Han
Sen.</p>
<p>Buzz!</p>
<p>The wolf god crouched and leaped forward, but then it
disappeared.</p>
<p>The wolf disappeared from Han Sen’s vision before he even got a
good look at it. His eyes couldn’t match the speed of the wolf
god.</p>
<p>Without hesitation, Han Sen used his super god spirit body.
While Han Sen was invincible, the wolf god’s gray body leaped at
him.</p>
<p>But instead of landing on Han Sen, the wolf god’s leap carried
it past him. It turned around and looked at Han Sen without
attacking again.</p>
<p>Han Sen had only just opened the super god spirit body, but he
noticed that his super god spirit power was already starting to
fade. Although Wan’er was asleep, her effect on the super god
spirit body was still strong.</p>
<p>Li Keer planned to watch the fight between the man and the wolf,
and then save Han Sen during a critical moment. But right after the
fight began, Han Sen ran away.</p>
<p>As Han Sen flew up away from the planet, she could see that he
had committed his full strength to fleeing. He didn’t hesitate or
ponder what direction he was going. Li Keer was frozen as she
watched him do that. She didn’t know if she should swoop in to save
Han Sen.</p>
<p>Although this was the result she wanted, she hadn’t expected it
to happen like this. She was planning to use the fight with the
wolf god to witness Dollar’s real power. Now she was still
empty-handed, and Han Sen was running away.</p>
<p>Li Keer was very confused. Han Sen apparently had no way of
defeating the wolf god, and the creature leaped into the air and
tore into Han Sen’s body with its teeth.</p>
<p>Pang!</p>
<p>Han Sen’s body was torn to shreds, but it was just a Moon
doppelganger. The real Han Sen appeared farther in space, and he
was still running.</p>
<p>He only wanted to confirm that there was a deified xenogeneic on
the planet. He didn’t plan on summoning the Gold Armor General to
defeat the wolf god in front of her.</p>
<p>But the wolf god was a very aggressive creature, and it kept
chasing after Han Sen. Although it wasn’t as strong as the Gold
Armor General, Han Sen would still have a hard time fighting it. He
kept using Moon copies of himself to avoid the wolf god.</p>
<p>Han Sen noticed that the core area’s deified xenogeneics had
some flaws. They might be deified in some ways, but in other ways,
they were much worse than proper deified xenogeneics.</p>
<p>Such as the Gold Armor General: while its defense and
swordlights were deified in class, its speed was still wholly King
class. It even fought like a King. The creature didn’t have the
control and talent that Han Sen would expect from a true
deified.</p>
<p>And while this wolf god’s speed was deified, its judgment and
skill weren’t up to par. Its attacking skills fell short, about as
talented as an average King. So, Han Sen could see that the wolf
was far weaker than an ordinary deified.</p>
<p>“No wonder the core area’s deifieds are referred to as fake
deifieds. They all have flaws. I can’t see them as being truly on a
deified level,” Han Sen thought to himself.</p>
<p>The epic battle Li Keer had hoped to watch quickly devolved into
a hungry wolf chasing a fleeing human. Han Sen used his clones and
movements to evade his foe. His movement skills were spectacular,
and not even the wolf god could harm him. But that still wasn’t
what Li Keer wanted.</p>
