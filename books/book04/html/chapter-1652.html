    <p>
      Han Sen summoned his Overbearing Shield and Split-Blade, then transformed
      into Fallen Slaughter. Split-Blade was sent thrusting at Guardian Spirit
    </p>
    <p>
      Split-Blade went right into Guardian Spirit’s body, but his body was
      actually like a genuine spirit’s. The body faded away with the attack of
      that blade.
    </p>
    <p>
      Immediately, Han Sen looked around. He was surprised at what he saw next.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the walls of the palace, there were many sets of crystal armor. The
      armors were all tarnished with damage. It made them seem as if they had
      all experienced a great deal of fighting.
    </p>
    <p>
      Upon those crystal sets of armor, Han Sen could suddenly feel his battle
      mode begin to burn. It was like the crystal armors still possessed the
      urge to fight, and it began to burn him.
    </p>
    <p>
      That hall felt like the site of a great battle. Han Sen, standing in the
      hall, felt as if he was surrounded by an army of foes. And he felt that
      the master of the army had been slaughtered in battle.
    </p>
    <p>
      What surprised Han Sen the most was that the armors looked like the one he
      had procured off Tina. They might have possessed different powers, but
      they sure looked similar.
    </p>
    <p>“Are they all geno armors?” Han Sen was in shock.</p>
    <p>
      Guardian Spirit’s body appeared again, directly in front of a blue set of
      armor. He was wreathed in lightning. He looked at the armor and said,
      “This is Zeus’ armor. He was out there for fifteen days before he fell.”
    </p>
    <p>
      After that, Guardian Spirit walked towards a red set of armor. And he
      said, “This is Ginger’s armor. He was out there for nineteen days before
      he died.”
    </p>
    <p>
      Guardian Spirit walked to each set of armor that could be seen, and told
      them who the armor belonged to. They were all the names of the tablets Han
      Sen had seen earlier.
    </p>
    <p>
      Guardian Spirit told Han Sen that they were indeed geno armors, and it
      came as quite the surprise to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      After introducing the last armor, Guardian Spirit looked at Han Sen and
      laughed. “They were heroes as much as they were failures. They weren’t
      able to get out. They were humiliated, and made to live here.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “What do you mean they were unable to get out?” Han Sen asked Guardian
      Spirit.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Get out of the sanctuary, of course.” Guardian Spirit said coldly. He
      turned to look back at the armor and went on to say, “Their master died,
      but their armor still resides here. If you gain their approval, you may
      make use of them. They may have failed, but they did not want to lose. And
      they’d want nothing more than to fight again.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “You are giving them to us?” Han Sen looked at Guardian Spirit in shock.
      He thought he’d have to conduct a big fight, but it didn’t seem as if
      there would be. It sounded as if he was going to be given the armor for
      nothing.
    </p>
    <p>
      “If you can take them with you, they’re yours. Having them here is
      useless, anyway.” Guardian Spirit’s voice made people’s teeth chatter.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Thanks a lot, then.” Han Sen did not feel guilty, so he waltzed up to the
      nearest set of armor and tried to lift it
    </p>
    <p>
      Most people did not know about the power of geno armors, but Han Sen did.
      The bronze palace was like a trove of treasure for Han Sen, and it was
      worth more than anything the Alliance could provide him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Han Sen picked up the red armor that once belonged to Ginger. There were
      seventy punctures and scrapes across it, and they all appeared to have
      been dealt by a sword. There were some piercings and dents across it, too.
    </p>
    <p>Pang!</p>
    <p>
      Han Sen, after gripping the armor and trying to lift it, was blasted away
      after it suddenly started glowing red.
    </p>
    <p>
      Han Sen felt a strong power crash into him, one he was unable to block. It
      was like he had been hit by a train, and he went barreling back into the
      stone. His ears rang and he was left seeing stars.
    </p>
    <p>“Are you okay?” Dragon Lady ran over to Han Sen and picked him up.</p>
    <p>
      “I’m fine,” Han Sen said. He shook his head to clear his vision. Trying to
      maintain conscious after that vicious blast, he directed his attention
      back to Guardian Spirit. “It’s fine if you don’t want to give them to me,
      but why do that?”
    </p>
    <p>
      Guardian Spirit laughed. “They have a will of their own. I can’t
      orchestrate their feelings. I told you that you’ll need their approval, if
      you are to take them.”
    </p>
    <p>
      Han Sen frowned and stared at Guardian Spirit. He did not believe what he
      was being told.
    </p>
    <p>
      After he took Tina’s geno armor, none of this happened. He was able to
      just take it.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Believe it or not, but I am who you see. I am Guardian Spirit. Lying to
      you would not gain me anything,” Guardian Spirit said. “I don’t believe
      you.” Han Sen gritted his teeth and tried taking another set of armor.
    </p>
    <p>
      The set of armor reacted the same way, and it blasted Han Sen away. The
      battle mood it possessed burned, and it clearly didn’t want to be touched
      by Han Sen.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Han Sen wasn’t going to give up so easily. He tried taking every
      single one. There were many of them, too; he was sure one of them had to
      suit him.
    </p>
    <p>
      But reality never aligned with Han Sen’s ideals. After trying each and
      every armor, none were willing to accept him. His body had ended up all
      swollen, all for the gain of naught.
    </p>
    <p>
      As Han Sen’s heart began to sink, Golden Growler walked forward and
      touched one of the armors.
    </p>
    <p>The armor was rather gold, but it was caked in green rust.</p>
    <p>
      Han Sen had tried grabbing it before, but it had blasted him away with
      gold light. Golden Growler’s claws were grabbing the geno core armor now.
    </p>
    <p>
      Han Sen thought Golden Growler would end up getting blasted away, but he
      didn’t. The geno armor was actually crushed beneath the might of his paws,
      like a simple golden snowflake. It blended into the skin of his body.
    </p>
    <p>Roar!</p>
    <p>
      When the entirety of that snowflake was absorbed by Golden Growler, he
      roared to the sky. The gold light appeared, and it manifested as a set of
      armor that would protect him. And then, Golden Growler did indeed look
      like a lion clad in armor.
    </p>
    <p>
      “That’s not real, is it? It’s weaker than Little Gold?” Han Sen’s eyes
      were open wide in astonishment, unable to believe what Golden Growler had
      managed to do.
    </p>
    <p>
      He couldn’t believe it. He himself had tried so hard to procure the
      armors, but he had failed every time. Golden Growler randomly touched one,
      and it submitted to his ownership. That wasn’t very fair.
