	<p>They walked for less than two days, and there were scary beings everywhere. Sometimes, Han Sen could even detect
		powerful auras sweeping across the sky. However, the creatures seemed to be moving chaotically. It felt less
		like they were chasing something, and more like they were searching.</p>

	<p>“They must be looking for that Destroyer Wolf,” said Elysian Moon.</p>

	<p>Just when Han Sen was about to respond, Xu Mi ran up to him and said, “Teacher, something major is happening!”
	</p>

	<p>“What’s happening?” Han Sen asked, looking at Xu Mi. He had sent Xu Mi out earlier to train.</p>

	<p>Xu Mi said excitedly, “The Destroyer Wolf stole a descendant of the master of Sacred shelter! Now, it has come
		toward us, and many powerful super creatures are chasing it.”</p>

	<p>“A child of Sacred shelter’s master? A creature like Goddess?” Han Sen suddenly imagined a goddess climbing out
		of an egg, which was a bizarre thought.</p>

	<p>“Yes. I heard that it’s the child of Sacred’s master and a berserk super creature, but the berserk super creature
		wasn’t living in Sacred shelter, which was how to Destroyer Wolf managed to steal the egg. Now, many powerful
		shelters like Sacred and Outer Sky are all hunting that Destroyer Wolf,” said Xu Mi.</p>

	<p>“Sacred is powerful enough to gather all those shelters to help him?” asked Han Sen, amazed.</p>

	<p>“No. They’re all looking for the egg. It’s a descendant of two berserk super creatures, so its genes must be
		extraordinary. The egg will be highly beneficial to any being that eats it. If it’s a female, then they’ll keep
		it and make it procreate with others to further improve the genes.” Xu Mi couldn’t be more excited. He lowered
		his voice and said to Han Sen, “Teacher, should we also go look for it? If we’re lucky enough, perhaps we can
		actually find the egg.”</p>

	<p>“Then let’s try to find it before others do.” Han Sen didn’t have much hope for it. Many top-tier shelters sent
		their most powerful creatures to look for the Destroyer Wolf and that egg.</p>

	<p>That Destroyer Wolf had been given plenty of time to hide itself. Han Sen didn’t think they alone would be able
		to find it. And even if he could find it, it wouldn’t be easy to steal the egg from so many terrifying beings.
	</p>

	<p>Many powerful creatures swept across the sky above them. After only half a day, Han Sen detected twenty different
		creatures flying over him, and those were just the ones close enough for him to notice.</p>

	<p>However, they were still searching chaotically. It seemed that they still hadn’t found the Destroyer Wolf yet.
	</p>

	<p>“Elysian Moon, where did you meet the Destroyer Wolf?” Han Sen asked her.</p>

	<p>“Near Rolling Dragon Lake,” Elysian Moon said, pointing in a direction.</p>

	<p>Han Sen was kind of familiar with the area around him, since it wasn’t far from his shelter. Rolling Dragon Like
		was a giant lake among the mountains, and it was named such because of the dragon-like creatures in the lake.
		Han Sen had heard that there was a lake nearby, but he had never been there.</p>

	<p>Though Rolling Dragon Lake was among the mountains, it was very large, more than a hundred square miles.</p>

	<p>However, the water in the lake was dark, giving out dark light like gas. It looked dense, so nobody could see
		anything that was even an inch below the water’s surface. Nobody could say for sure whether a creature could
		actually live in the water or not.</p>

	<p>When Han Sen and the others arrived at the lake, they found Goddess already there. Goddess looked a bit different
		from before. Her lifeforce had become terrifying, but it was also obscured and difficult to read. It seemed that
		she had reached super level.</p>

	<p>Just as Han Sen observed Goddess, she also noticed Han Sen, and her eyes became aloof. However, seeing Gu
		Qingcheng beside Han Sen, Goddess frowned and began walking toward Han Sen with some creatures from her shelter
		beside her.</p>

	<p>There were four creatures beside Goddess, and they were all livid. Apparently, they were already super creatures,
		and all of them were mighty.</p>

	<p>However, Goddess didn’t talk to Han Sen. Instead, she walked up to Gu Qingcheng and asked, “Elysium Master, is
		this person related to you?”</p>

	<p>“How is that your business, one way or the other?” asked Gu Qingcheng, mildly.</p>

	<p>“This man is a mortal enemy of mine. If he doesn’t have anything to do with you, I’m going to take my revenge
		now.”</p>

	<p>Gu Qingcheng took a look at Han Sen, squinted her eyes, and said, “What do you think?”</p>

	<p>Han Sen heard it and said, “Of course there’s a connection between us. We’re partners working together.”</p>

	<p>“You heard that, right?” Gu Qingcheng said, glancing at Goddess.</p>

	<p>“Of course. I’ll let him go this time for your sake.” Goddess waved her hands and left with those four super
		creatures.</p>

	<p>“You get along pretty well here.” Han Sen gave a thumbs up to Gu Qingcheng.</p>

	<p>“You owe me one,” said Gu Qingcheng.</p>

	<p>“Okay, no problem, but I’m still a bit confused. Why did she call you Elysium Master? You’re a human. How did you
		become the head of the Elysium race?” Han Sen was curious about that.</p>

	<p>“That has nothing to do with you.” Gu Qingcheng glared at him, then took Elysian Moon and walked toward the lake.
	</p>

	<p>Han Sen looked in the direction that Goddess had vanished, then followed Gu Qingcheng and Elysian Moon.</p>

	<p>There was indeed some evidence of a fight that had happened beside the lake, and there were some residual tears
		in the fabric of space. They were feeble, but they hadn’t yet healed entirely.</p>

	<p>Goddess and her sidekicks were also looking at that those rips in space. They could tell that the tears had been
		left by Destroyer Wolf.</p>

	<p>Han Sen also used his Dongxuan aura to observe the remaining evidence of the wolf. There were only a few
		molecules left, and it was probably because Destroyer Wolf got away through the space fault, so it didn’t leave
		any molecules on its way.</p>

	<p>Gu Qingcheng only looked at it for a short while, but she couldn’t find any clues. She frowned and said, “Someone
		was definitely chasing the Destroyer Wolf, and that’s how Elysian Moon was lucky enough to get away. The
		Destroyer Wolf also escaped through the space cracks. We might not be able to find any traces here.”</p>

	<p>“Let’s just walk around and look. Perhaps we’ll be lucky enough to find some clues.” Han Sen took a look at
		Rolling Dragon Lake and walked to the other side.</p>

	<p>The Destroyer Wolf really hadn’t left much of a trail, but Han Sen could see that it had left behind a few
		molecules, at least. He then walked toward the other side of the shining lake and found more traces of some sort
		of creature.</p>

	<p>Han Sen didn’t know which creature these molecules belonged to, but he could tell that those molecules had been
		left there at the same time as the molecules left by Destroyer Wolf. That indicated that another creature had
		been in the area at the same time as Destroyer Wolf. Han Sen wanted to find that creature first to see what he
		could learn from it.</p>
