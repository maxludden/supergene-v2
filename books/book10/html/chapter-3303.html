<p>It was not as if it was tricky dealing with them. It was just that those people loved to keep fighting. It was like he was playing a card game. To win every time led one to get bored pretty quickly. Plus, they would keep fighting for days on end. They would try and try without ever wanting to take a break.</p>

<p>“Bao’er should be okay with the Feng family.” Although Han Sen knew about Bao’er’s power and that nothing would happen to her, he still found himself rather worried about how she was doing.</p>

<p>Han Sen tried to use Super God Spirit mode to go through Outer Sky. After absorbing the power of the prototype replica, he noticed that if his body became a spirit body, he was able to go through the 33 skies. That made Han Sen very happy.</p>

<p>The only thing Han Sen did not like about it was the fact that he could only use his body to go through. He could not take anything with him. He could not bring Bao’er back to the geno universe.</p>

<p>He took the Break World gene from Bao’er. It was a tear-shaped crystal. Han Sen held the crystal and used a geno art to try and absorb it, but the crystal did not respond.</p>

<p>Han Sen hesitated. He put the Break World gene into his belly. He felt a weird power spread throughout his body. His cells rapidly started to change as the body’s gene messages were updated.</p>

<p>“Break World gene plus five.”</p>

<p>When the weird power was gone, and his body stopped changing, Han Sen heard that familiar sound.</p>

<p>“One Break World gene only adds 5%. How Break World beasts must I kill to max out my Break World gene tally?” Han Sen felt depressed.</p>

<p>Break World elites were exceptionally rare. Unless Qin Xiu started to mass-produce Break World beasts, it would be incredibly hard to find Break World elites. They would also be even harder to kill once they were found.</p>

<p>“The 33 skies have many scary gene races. They should be Break World caliber. I wonder if their bodies can yield Break World genes for me too?” Han Sen thought about the 33 skies.</p>

<p>There were still a dozen skies that had not been broken. There were many scary gene races yet to be fought. Many of those beasts had Break World capabilities. If their bodies had Break World genes, Han Sen did not have to be afraid of lacking a sufficient amount of Break World genes for his own consumption and improvement.</p>

<p>“While Qin Xiu has not yet broken through the 33rd sky, I can bring the good stuff back. It will be better for me than to benefit Qin Xiu.” Han Sen made his mind up. He returned to the 33 skies.</p>

<p>Before Han Sen arrived at the Feng family castle, the ground quaked. The sky had a black dot in it.</p>

<p>“What is this?” People were soon shocked to realize the black dot was becoming bigger. It became a black hole that sucked everything around into it.</p>

<p>When Han Sen saw the black hole, his face changed. That was because the presence of the black hole let out was not a presence from that universe. It was a presence from the geno universe.</p>

<p>“Did Qin Xiu break the 33 skies? How could he have accomplished things so quickly?” Han Sen did not believe it. He made Bao’er and the Zhao sisters stay in the Feng family castle. He went toward that black hole.</p>

<p>Before he could get much closer to the black hole, he felt a weird power come from that vortex. It was a main and reverse power that had combined to form a swirl. Ordinary creatures could not combat this power. Their bodies would be torn to shreds.</p>

<p>Han Sen entered Super God Spirit mode. He went through the black hole. His face looked dire.</p>

<p>The geno universe was on the other side of the black hole. The black hole pierced and bridged the two universes.</p>

<p>“It looks like Qin Xiu accomplished what he was striving for, but I will confess that these black holes seem rather odd. They have pierced and bridged the two universes, but it seems as if they do not go through the 33 skies.” Han Sen frowned and wondered what was going on.</p>

<p>The two universes were pierced and bridged through space. There were some strong changes.</p>

<p>The powers of the two universes created tension in the black hole. Within that tension, and with the power of the universes, the place around the black hole had some scary changes.</p>

<p>Many creatures that were already on top of the food chain felt the anti-universe power. They started to break the world.</p>

<p>Suddenly, they were unable to break the world, but it was only a matter of time before they did.</p>

<p>Han Sen quickly realized that when the black hole expanded to a certain level, it stopped expanding. It did not close, however. It was like there was a windpipe to keep the two universal powers constantly swapping.</p>

<p>“It looks like Qin Xiu did not really break through the 33 skies, but I don’t want what he might have done to drive this gap in between both universes.” Han Sen looked upon this event with full seriousness.</p>

<p>Although the 33 skies were never fully broken open, the exchange between the two black holes was as big as two universes.</p>

<p>Both universes had strong creatures breaking into the black hole. They wanted to visit another universe.</p>

<p>Nearby, a Destroyed elite ran out through the black hole. Han Sen did not know if he could safely go to the other side through the black hole.</p>

<p>Where Han Sen could not see, two of the worlds had powerful creatures trying to visit another universe by entering the black hole. The world was in chaos.</p>

<p>In the geno hall, the 12 Annihilation main gods gathered around. God Hall Leader seemed serious.</p>

<p>Light Goddess looked serious as she said, “Mister Leader, in the space of our universes, it seemed something has pierced and bridged the main and reverse universes. It is a sign of the 33 skies being broken. Qin Xiu really managed to achieve it.”</p>

<p>“This was expected, but none of us knew it would happen this quickly.” God Hall Leader sighed.</p>

<p>“What do we do? Should we stop them?” Light Goddess asked.</p>

<p>God Hall Leader shook his head. “Your powers are not the best they can be yet. The main and the reverse universes have been pierced through. This might enable you guys to recover your powers. It is not entirely a bad thing.”</p>

<p>“If the 33 skies can be pierced through, it will be very bad for us. Our power is at 90% now. We can still fight.” Moment God was someone who loved to fight.</p>

<p>God Hall Leader coldly said, “With the geno tablet suppressing the 33rd sky, even if they find a spirit that makes it to the 33rd sky, to pierce through all 33 skies would not be so easy. You guys shouldn’t worry. Use this as a chance. Use this as a special time to recover your god powers. It can be a boon for you.”</p>
