  Han Sen tried it a few times, but it seemed certain that it would not work. He was unable to touch the girl.

The girl reached out her hand to try and hold onto Han Sen, but that did not work either. She was unable to touch him, and her body was trapped and suspended by that light. She was unable to exit it.

Seeing that the little girl was about to leave Soldier Weapon Sky, Han Sen was both shocked and afraid. He was really angry about this, but he knew he needed to calm down first. The girl was going to leave Soldier Weapon Sky soon. There was no time for him to panic. He was not going to let emotional turmoil cloud his vision and have him squander the chance to fix this.

Han Sen calmed down. He suddenly found a weird movement start to occur inside the girl. That movement was from the girl’s soul. To be more accurate, it was Han Sen’s soul.

The soul mark had been unable to be refined by the girl. It was in the girl’s soul. It kept a connection with Han Sen’s soul.

Because Han Sen’s emotions were changing, the soul changed a lot too.

Han Sen saw the soul and the girl start to leave Soldier Weapon Sky, so he did not hesitate. He was determined. He immediately used his Super God Spirit mode to activate his spirit body and go to the girl.

The moment the girl left the Soldier Weapon Sky, the soul Han Sen became went into the soul mark he had and vanished with the girl.

The two universes continued having elites trying to breach the 33 skies. They all wanted to assert control over the 33 skies. More and more leaders were starting to appear.

There were far fewer Break World elites in the geno universe than there were in the universe of kingdoms. Regarding the growth, the geno universe was not too bad.

Since the life soul chaos, the 33 skies had returned to their origin. It was through this that the geno universe was able to vastly improve. Many Break World elites appeared. Although their Break World rates were not high, their potential was strong. They improved quickly.

There were geno universe elites, and they had a scary name in the 33 skies. Compared to the universe of kingdoms’ elites, they were not too shabby.

Sky Palace Leader Yu Shanxin, Lone Bamboo, Human King, Holy Gourd Vine, Very High Leader, and other elites of the universe were in the 33 skies fighting other elites too. They all wanted to be a supreme leader.

There were now 16 established leaders in 16 skies. Aside from Human King, who wasn’t too famous in the geno universe, no one else was able to assert a sky for themselves.

“Where is Dollar? Why did Dollar not come to claim a sky?”

“If Mister Dollar was here, he could conquer all 33 skies.”

The geno universe hoped they would have an elite who could become a leader of all the skies, and many put their faith in the return of Dollar. But Dollar was someone who had sunk into the sea. There was no sign of him to be found.

Wang Yuhang looked at Littleflower and complained. “Littleflower, what is your Dad doing? He has been gone for so long, yet he hasn’t taken a sky.”

Space Garden had many elites wondering about that as well. They pondered why Han Sen had not taken one of the skies. With Han Sen’s power, he should have been able to claim a sky.

Wang Yuhang could no longer help it. He stood up and declared, “No. I cannot wait any longer. I am going to the 33 skies to have a look. Let’s go and see what San Mu is up to.”

Tang Zhenliu grabbed Wang Yuhang and asked, “Go? How are you going to go there? You have not even broken the world. Ordinary Break World beasts cannot get inside the 33 skies, so what makes you think you will be able to?”

Going to the 33 skies was dangerous. Many Break World beasts had already died trying to gain access, failing at its outskirts.

“I have already broken the world,” Littleflower said. “You should just let me go.”

Han Yan stopped him and said, “Littleflower, you cannot go. What happened to your brother? Auntie is already worried. If you went and died there, your mother would be very sad.”

Littleflower looked troubled. Recently, Ji Yanran had expressed a lot of worry about Han Sen. She kept having nightmares. If he vanished again, Ji Yanran was going to be worried even more.

“I am close to breaking the world. Wait a few more days, and I will go when I have broken the world. Let us see what San Mu is doing in the 33 skies.” Xie Qing King was looking very confident, and that bled into his speech.

“It will be better to just wait for me,” Yi Dong Mu said. “I will probably break the world sooner than you.”

Everyone wanted to go to the 33 skies. They kept talking, but none of them managed to break the world. They did not have what it took to go to the 33 skies.

“If there are no other ways, why don’t we instead ask for Mister White to go?” Han Yan asked after briefly thinking.

“Stop talking!” Wang Yuhang shouted. “When I said I will go, I will go!”

“I said that if you have not broken the world, you cannot even enter the 33 skies,” Tang Zhenliu said. “Stop trying to goof around, Little Uncle.”

“I am not messing around,” Wang Yuhang said. “I have managed to break the world.”

Everyone looked at Wang Yuhang. He was the sort to fool around constantly. He did not practice or kill anything, so there was no way he had managed to break the world yet.

“Little Uncle, this is no joke. There is no exit out of the 33 skies.” Tang Zhenliu did not believe Wang Yuhang, which was why he said that.

It was not just him who didn’t believe Wang Yuhang. No one else believed him either.

Wang Yuhang sighed and said, “Since there is no one else here, and everyone here is from the sanctuaries, I will not lie. I have been possessed by a life soul.”

“How is that possible? This is bad… This is bad…” Tang Zhenliu thought Wang Yuhang was joking. He laughed and moved to pat Wang Yuhang on the shoulder.

His hands did not touch Wang Yuhang’s shoulders. They were in the air. As he smiled and spoke, his speech was cut short.

Wang Yuhang’s body changed. There was some weird light on him. His head was given a transparent crown. His entire body looked weird. His eyes were given an evil, cold light. His whole form looked a bit evil. He looked like an evil god. It was not like the happy Wang Yuhang he always was.

“How is this possible?” Everyone looked at Wang Yuhang with worry. They did not mind Wang Yuhang becoming a Break World beast, but the will of a Break World beast was obsessed with killing a lot very quickly. They were afraid Wang Yuhang would lose control of himself.

Wang Yuhang shook his head. “Do not worry. I am fine. My will has not been taken by the life soul yet. My body has not completely changed. I am not a complete Break World beast. I am half-man and half-beast.”

He mocked himself and said, “It is fine. I am not planning to get married. I can be half-beast. It has saved me some time and spared me from needing to practice. I will not have to work hard. If you guys cannot go to the 33 skies, I will go on your behalf. You guys wait here, and I will go and take a look.”

After that, Wang Yuhang flew out of the base.
