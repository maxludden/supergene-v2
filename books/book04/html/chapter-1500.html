      Luckily, the beetle had a galactic map of its own. It was better than the
      ones the Alliance had, and with it, Ji Yanran was able to determine their
      location. They were in the Barrens, a place the Alliance had name Plato.
    </p>
    <p>
      It wasn’t a long journey to return to the bubble of space humans occupied,
      and with the speed of the beetle, they estimated that the journey would
      only take half a day.
    </p>
    <p>
      Han Sen relaxed. He looked at Ji Yanran as she drove the beetle and asked
      her, “What is the New Community? Have you heard about them before?”
    </p>
    <p>
      Ji Yanran shook her head. “No. But if they managed to summon five human
      demigods, they couldn’t be just some faceless, nameless organization.
      Father must know something about them. We should ask him.”
    </p>
    <p>
      The black beetle flew through the Barrens with ease. It was a place not
      occupied by humans, and they saw nothing as they went.
    </p>
    <p>
      Han Sen put the beetle on autopilot, and it gave him, Ji Yanran, Bao’er,
      and Littleflower the opportunity to play together. Their trip was not
      boring.
    </p>
    <p>
      The beetle had been flying for about an hour, and as Han Sen was playing
      with Littleflower, he suddenly heard a message coming from the AI.
    </p>
    <p>“Main Control Room discovered. Should we land?”</p>
    <p>
      “What Main Control Room?” Han Sen looked at the black beetle’s display
      with shock. To the left of the beetle was a large planet, one that looked
      to have been created from diamond. The planet was moving fast, faster than
      the Alliance’s greatest ships.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Is that a crystallizer planet?” Han Sen was shocked. He looked at the
      map, but the charts gave no indication of a diamond planet residing where
      they currently were.
    </p>
    <p>
      That meant the planet did not belong there, and yet for some reason, there
      it was.
    </p>
    <p>
      “That looks like it.” Ji Yanran was the captain of a crystallizer research
      team, so she knew quite a lot about this stuff.
    </p>
    <p>“Should we land?” The black beetle’s AI repeated the message.</p>
    <p>“Is it dangerous?” Han Sen asked.</p>
    <p>
      “The Main Control Room is devoid of lifeforms. The risk is minimal,” the
      beetle answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ji Yanran and Han Sen had a discussion about this, as the discovery of new
      crystallizer relics was a rare opportunity. Since there wasn’t supposed to
      be any risk, though, they decided they should go just in case they could
      discover new technology.
    </p>
    <p>
      And since the diamond planet was moving so fast, this could be their only
      chance to explore this place.
    </p>
    <p>
      Han Sen commanded the beetle to land. It didn’t do it immediately, and it
      seemed to fire a signal at the planet first. Only after the signal was
      sent did they begin approaching.
    </p>
    <p>
      “A connection to the Main Control Room has been established. We will begin
      docking procedures now.”
    </p>
    <p>
      The beetle flew down towards the planet. The planet opened up as they
      approached, as if it were one large docking station itself, and the beetle
      itself went straight inside.
    </p>
    <p>“Is this really not dangerous?” Han Sen asked.</p>
    <p>
      The beetle answered, “The Main Control Room is running automatically.
      There are no lifeforces there; provided no rules are violated, the risk is
      and will remain minimal for you.”
    </p>
    <p>“And what are the rules of the Main Control Room?” Han Sen asked.</p>
    <p>
      The beetle’s monitors displayed a variety of information that had been
      translated into the language of the Alliance. Han Sen was able to see it
      all.
    </p>
    <p>
      They carefully read the safety rules before they instructed the beetle to
      proceed.
    </p>
    <p>
      The entire planet was some sort of big crystal tool. It was far more
      advanced than anything the Alliance had. Star-class battleships were like
      toys before something like this.
    </p>
    <p>
      Han Sen and Ji Yanran were in shock, sitting in the beetle as they were
      brought in to see the entirety of the Main Control Room.
    </p>
    <p>
      There they could see the operations of the tools of the Main Control Room.
      The rules dictated that they were not allowed to touch them. If they did,
      they’d suffer punishment.
    </p>
    <p>
      Although Han Sen was a demigod, he still remained careful around all the
      crystallizer things. Crystallizers were once the most advanced
      civilization, and they had left behind a lot of technology neither the
      humans nor shura had yet come to understand.
    </p>
    <p>
      “We have reached the lounge. Would you like to enter?” The beetle asked as
      they reached a crystallizer door.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Let’s go in.” Han Sen was tired of seeing those tools at work. He wasn’t
      a scientist or engineer, and just watching them bored him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Han Sen was very curious to check out a crystallizer lounge, as this was
      where they’d come to rest and relax. He was keen to find out how they
      entertained themselves.
    </p>
    <p>The beetle opened the door and landed on the ground.</p>
    <p>
      Han Sen discovered himself in a plaza with a large number of statues,
      fountains, and benches. These, however, seemed to have been made of
      crystal. The strangest thing about what they were seeing, though, was that
      the statues seemed to depict figures that looked an awful lot like humans.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Weird. When the crystallizers existed, there weren’t any humans around,
      were there? So why are there statues of humans?” Ji Yanran stood before
      the statue, with a look of grand curiosity.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Maybe it’s because there were creatures that looked like humans in the
      past, like the shura,” Han Sen suggested.
    </p>
    <p>
      They jumped out of the beetle, and Bao’er leaped directly onto a bench.
      The bench that seemed to have been made of crystal was actually plush, and
      Bao’er jumped up and down on it like a trampoline.
    </p>
    <p>
      Because it was a lounge, there were no rules for them to follow there. Han
      Sen wasn’t worried about Bao’er triggering something, so he left her to
      play while he walked around with Ji Yanran.
    </p>
    <p>
      There were so many things Han Sen didn’t understand or know about, and
      anything he didn’t, he could ask the beetle. The beetle would scan the
      item in response to his query and give him the answers he sought.
    </p>
    <p>
      Han Sen found it more and more strange. The furniture and decorations
      looked very human-like. He wondered why the lounge looked the way it did.
    </p>
    <p>“Maybe the crystallizers looked like humans?” Han Sen guessed.</p>
    <p>
      “With this layout, you could be right. If this is true, it would be a most
      shocking revelation. The Alliance has researched the crystallizers for the
      longest time, but we have yet to learn what they might have looked like.
      It is a common belief that the crystallizers had bodies made from crystal.
      If they actually looked just like humans, that would be amazing.” Ji
      Yanran was beginning to sound very excited.
    </p>
    <p>
      The two of them continued looking around as they spoke, but all of a
      sudden, something snagged Han Sen’s attention. On a chair, there was a
      book that seemed to have been composed of paper. And surprisingly, Han Sen
      was able to read the text on it. It was in a written language of ancient
      humans.
