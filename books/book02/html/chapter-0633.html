    <p>
      &#8220;Old Chen, I am surprised you have found the time to come visit
      me.&#8221; Han Sen opened the door to the sight of Chen Ran standing
      outside it, alone.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Zhu Ting said you are a good friend of his. I heard from him that
      you were here, and so I have come to see you. Why didn&#8217;t you say so
      before? If you had, perhaps our acquaintance and travel together would
      have been far more cordial.&#8221; Chen Ran smiled.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen thought to himself in his heart, &#8220;It would be a great
      misfortune to be considered your family.&#8221;
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen&#8217;s relationship with the Chen family was fine. It
      wasn&#8217;t particularly amicable, but there had been no strife between
      them, either. Had Chen Ran known about his connection with Zhu Ting, it
      wouldn&#8217;t have made a difference. Chen Ran&#8217;s actions that day
      were not spurred by anything other than his selfish desire to live,
      putting himself before anyone else.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Please, come in.&#8221; Han Sen allowed Chen Ran to enter. He was
      keen to know what he was here for. He was fairly sure Chan Ren
      hadn&#8217;t come here to wish him a warm recovery and become buddies with
      a friend of his family&#8217;s bastard.
    </p>

    <p>
      Chen Ran entered the room, looked around, smiled, and said, &#8220;Brother
      Han, this place is no good for you. How about you move into my shelter? I
      will prepare the best room for you, have the nicest food served to you,
      and have the prettiest girls wait on you. You&#8217;ll have everything
      there.&#8221;
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Old Chen, thank you but no thank you. I will be returning to the
      ice fields in two days. If there is something you would like to tell me or
      get off your chest, I am standing right here,&#8221; Han Sen said.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Okay. You and Zhu Ting are best friends. You aren&#8217;t
      outsiders, so I&#8217;ll come right out and say it.&#8221; Chen Ran looked
      at Han Sen and paused briefly. Then he told him, &#8220;Since you are
      returning to the ice fields, would you aid me by delivering a few beast
      souls to Zhu Ting?&#8221;
    </p>

    <p>&#8220;How many beast souls?&#8221; Han Sen asked.</p>

    <p>
      &#8220;A few thousand.&#8221; Before anything could be asked, Chen Ran
      continued, &#8220;Of course, this won&#8217;t be for free. This card I
      have here has fifty million in it. This is the price I can pay you for
      their delivery.&#8221;
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen observed the card Chen Ran pulled out but did not take it. He
      laughed on the inside, and said to himself, &#8220;This old man is smart.
      There is a lack of beast souls in the ice fields, and now this man is
      having me transport a vast number there. He tells me he&#8217;ll give me
      fifty million, but who knows how many billions he&#8217;ll earn from their
      sale?&#8221;
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Old Chen, you are well aware of the situation in the ice fields. I
      am a self-proclaimed leader, little more. The true managers of the ice
      field are Li Xing Lun and Qi Xiuwen. Even if I did transport them there, I
      do not believe they would allow Zhu Ting to sell them,&#8221; Han Sen
      said, smiling.
    </p>

    <p>
      The ice fields did indeed belong to Han Sen. The markets were his. The
      only way he would have helped Chen Ran earn such money was if he had
      become insane.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;We are family. You are king of the ice fields! I am sure you can
      think of something.&#8221; Chen Ran pulled out another card and presented
      it to Han Sen. Then he said, &#8220;Here is five hundred million. You have
      to take this money to help out Zhu Ting, this poor kid. He was born
      poorly, alone in the ice fields without family. It is my sole desire to
      help him.&#8221;
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen did not believe Chen Ran was the sort of person who was willing to
      aid a bastard son. He eyed Chen Ran up and down and smiled, &#8220;Old
      Chen, there is no need for me to accept this money. The ice fields do not
      belong to me alone. If you want to do business, I will accept 20% of the
      revenue generated from any sale of these boast souls you wish for me to
      transport.&#8221;
    </p>

    <p>
      Chen Ran&#8217;s face was unexpectedly happy. He jovially said,
      &#8220;Sure, if you say so!&#8221;
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen then proceeded to say, &#8220;But like I said, the ice fields do
      not belong to me alone. Aside from my Goddess Army, there is the Star
      Wheel faction, Blackgod faction, and Philip faction. This deal will not
      work if they aren&#8217;t provided a benefit. If you really want me to
      help you, then you will have to provide them 20% of each sale, as well. If
      you are willing to accept these terms, then I would be delighted to help
      you!&#8221;
    </p>

    <p>
      Chen Ran&#8217;s face was stiff. It didn&#8217;t move an inch. He looked
      at Han Sen and said, &#8220;Brother Han, you are too cruel. I thought you
      were a friend of Zhu Ting. Do you not believe yourself to be a little
      inappropriate by making such a suggestion?&#8221;
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen smiled and responded, &#8220;Old Chen, I am helping you flood my
      market with a large number of beast souls. Through a simple export of
      beast souls, you can earn 20% for yourself! Not bad, eh? And besides,
      I&#8217;m only being this nice because it is as you said, we&#8217;re
      family. I&#8217;ll be giving you 20% on Zhu Ting&#8217;s account.
      Otherwise, you&#8217;d be lucky to receive 10%.&#8221;
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Young man, you cannot conduct business like this. Sometimes, a
      simple favor is better than any monetary gain. If you accept 50%, then
      perhaps I will have further business ventures for you in the
      future.&#8221;
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Then I apologize. I must regretfully inform you once more that the
      ice fields do not belong to me alone. If I only accept 50%, I cannot
      report this to the others,&#8221; Han Sen said.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen thought it better to be without a favor from someone like Chen
      Ran. He was happy to allow Xu Dong Jin and his brothers, who followed him
      with an unwavering faith, to be unceremoniously sacrificed so he could
      escape. His favors were the sort of thing that could get you killed.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Well, if things are indeed like that, I regret bothering you this
      day.&#8221; As Chen Ran started walking, he appeared to be fuming.
    </p>

    <p>
      After Chen Ran left Han Sen&#8217;s room, he signaled for a few others to
      come to his side. Then, Chen Ran coldly said, &#8220;Keep an eye on that
      one. As soon as he leaves the shelter, contact me.&#8221;
    </p>

    <p>
      Accepting their appointed tasks, the people around Chen Ran got set up to
      spy on Han Sen.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Huh, this is the son of Han Jing Zhi? No way that old man had a
      child.&#8221; Chen Ran&#8217;s eyes flashed with a sinister haze.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen stroked the silver fox&#8217;s fur and squinted his eyes. With his
      senses, he didn&#8217;t even need to take a proper look to learn his house
      was being watched.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;It looks like Han Jing Zhi&#8217;s name cannot keep everyone at
      bay,&#8221; Han Sen thought to himself, but he didn&#8217;t really care.
      If Chen Ran did not attack, then it would be fine. If he did attack, at
      least Han Sen could try out his peacock crossbow and raven feathers.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen took out a geno creation pill from his chest pocket. Dong Lin
      delivered them two days ago, and since the silver fox loved them so much,
      it&#8217;d eat one every day.
    </p>

    <p>
      The silver fox wouldn&#8217;t eat more than one, though. Perhaps as a
      result of the pills, its hair was getting smoother and smoother. But aside
      from that, he couldn&#8217;t tell much of a difference.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#8220;Dong Lin&#8217;s people say ordinary evolvers only have to consume
      one for their genes to mutate. But if the silver fox has already eaten a
      few, why have there been no changes?&#8221; Han Sen looked at the silver
      fox with wonder, as it gobbled down its daily pill.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen did not know if it was because the genes of the silver fox were
      too strong, thus making it difficult for it to mutate, or if it was
      because the pills would only affect humans.
    </p>

    <p>
      Han Sen placed the silver fox aside. He put the gourd on the table and
      began practicing his Dongxue Sutra.
    </p>

    <p>
      Earlier, he had been too injured to practice the Dongxue Sutra. Instead,
      he had been usingJadeskin to recover the wounds on his body. Now that he
      was fully healed, he could being training with the Dongxue Sutra again.
    </p>

    <p>
      After Han Sen cast it, his body began to smell good. The pleasant
      fragrance overwhelmed the entire room.
    </p>

    <p>
      The silver fox was lying down near Han Sen, trying to sniff the pleasing
      scent that was coming from its master. Even the gourd slightly shivered,
      as if it was absorbing the perfume.
