<p>In the next moment, everyone was shocked. Han Sen was surprised
too.</p>
<p>Rainbow light flew out of the punch mark. It turned into a white
falcon. It surrounded Bai Wushang as it flew.</p>
<p>It did not attack Bai Wushang. It flapped its wings and landed
on Bai Wushang’s shoulder. It twisted its neck to rub against Bai
Wushang’s hair in a very intimate way.</p>
<p>“What is going on? Why did the stone tablet have another falcon
xenogeneic inside it? Why is it being so intimate with Bai
Wushang?” All the primitive people were confused.</p>
<p>While they were wondering what was happening, Bai Wushang
flipped his hand. He grabbed the falcon by its neck and placed it
out in front of himself. He ripped the falcon in half and threw the
pieces on the ground.</p>
<p>The white falcon squealed in pain. When it hit the floor, it
turned into two pieces of stone. It soon turned into dust that flew
back to the stone tablet. It covered up the punching marks left
behind by Bai Wushang. The marks vanished and left no trace
behind.</p>
<p>“Interesting. This stone tablet is a very unique stone
xenogeneic.” Han Sen thought this was interesting. He looked at the
stone tablet with interest.</p>
<p>After destroying the white falcon, Bai Wushang looked at the
stone tablet again. The gold flames on his body were like a volcano
erupting. He raised a fist.</p>
<p>He still used Extreme King Shocking Sky Punch being used. This
time, Bai Wushang’s Extreme King Shocking Sky Punch shone like a
sun. He unleashed a strong wave of power that was like a thunderous
tide. The primitive creatures flew away.</p>
<p>The remaining primitive deifieds were blown away a few hundred
miles before coming to a stop. They all looked pale and were
bleeding from their mouths. They looked injured.</p>
<p>That was just from the punch’s shockwave unleashed by Bai
Wushang. If they were the ones to receive that hit, they would have
been reduced to ash.</p>
<p>Han Sen was sitting nearby. He did not react. His shirt sleeves
were waving as if they were held to a harsh wind.</p>
<p>Boom!</p>
<p>Bai Wushang left another punch mark on the stone tablets. This
time, the punch marks were much bigger. They were much bigger than
the cat paw and even bigger than the cow footprint. It was a little
smaller than the handprint on top.</p>
<p>The punch was over. Bai Wushang pulled his fist back, but he saw
his marks were smaller than the handprint and frowned.</p>
<p>After pulling his fist back, the punch marks again shone with
rainbow light. This time, the rainbow light was many times stronger
than the previous rainbow light.</p>
<p>Han Sen saw a big, gold bird fly out of the mark. It flapped its
wings and flew into the nine tears in the sky. It squealed loud
enough to tear space. Its body had gold feathers that were
blindingly shiny. It was like pure sunshine.</p>
<p>“Gold Wing Big God Bird.” Han Sen looked at the big gold bird
with shock. Seeing its face, he was able to recognize it as the
legendary Gold Wing Big God Bird. The power of its body was mighty.
It was regarded as a top deified xenogeneic.</p>
<p>After taking a closer look, one noticed it was different. Han
Sen did not know what the real Gold Wing Big God Bird looked
like.</p>
<p>This Gold Wing Big God Bird that came out of the punch mark had
a stone element. It also had a wave of power very much like Extreme
King Shocking Sky Punch.</p>
<p>The Gold Wing Big God Bird landed on Bai Wushang. It placed its
head near him and looked as if it wanted to make him happy.</p>
<p>Han Sen thought, “This stone tablet is very funny. It can take
Bai Wushang’s full power attack. It is a true god xenogeneic for
sure, but it cannot attack. It can only live. That is very
interesting.”</p>
<p>A part of the stone tablet body suddenly broke and became a
stone element bird xenogeneic. It was given to the enemy in hopes
that the enemy would leave. Its way of life was like a gecko.</p>
<p>The stone element bird xenogeneic that came out was an
independent xenogeneic. The Gold Wing Big God Bird’s power was not
inferior to a top-class deified xenogeneic.</p>
<p>The Gold Wing Big God Bird absorbed Bai Wushang’s Extreme King
Shocking Sky Punch power. It was a xenogeneic with two elements.
With that xenogeneic for a follower, it would help a lot.</p>
<p>Upon seeing this, the primitive deified creatures felt
remarkably jealous. They did not have enough power to leave the
most minor of marks on the stone tablet. Besides a Gold Wing Big
God Bird, they were not even able to create a sparrow.</p>
<p>Everyone knew that the more wounds the stone tablet incurred,
the stronger the stone element xenogeneic bird would be when it
appeared.</p>
<p>Like the falcon, Bai Wushang punched out. It was much weaker
than this Gold Wing Big God Bird.</p>
<p>Everyone was jealous. Bai Wushang’s hand came forward and ripped
the head of the Gold Wing Big God Bird off.</p>
<p>The Gold Wing Big God Bird turned into simple stones, which flew
back to the stone tablet. They filled up Bai Wushang’s punch mark
and returned to normal.</p>
<p>Han Sen thought, “It looks like the three marks up there are
ones left behind by someone who also took the stone element
xenogeneic bird away with them.”</p>
<p>Everybody looked at Bai Wushang. He had ripped the Gold Wing Big
God Bird’s head off. It looked like he wanted to use an even
stronger power to hit the stone tablet.</p>
<p>Bai Wushang stopped attacking the stone tablet. He looked at Han
Sen, who was standing nearby. Han Sen was shocked. Bai Wushang’s
power had been remarkably strong. It was better than any top true
god class elite Han Sen had ever seen. With the destructive power
he had, he wasn’t much weaker than Sky Palace Leader or Very High
Leader.</p>
<p>Han Sen was also quite strong, but he wasn’t certain he could
beat Bai Wushang. After all, he was not yet true god class. He was
still quite different compared to true gods.</p>
<p>The Xuan Yellow Sutra could go against deifieds of the same
level or less and permanently beat others into dust. When used
against true gods greater than Han Sen, it would only make them
temporarily drop a level.</p>
<p>The most important thing was that other people had seen him use
the Xuan Yellow Sutra while conquering the Destroyed Leader. They
must have been prepared for it. It would not be easy for Han Sen to
use the Xuan Yellow power to strike again.</p>
<p>Han Sen’s heart was prepared, but Bai Wushang did not look like
he wanted to fight. He pointed to the stone tablet and said, “You
give it a go.”</p>
<p>Han Sen looked at Bai Wushang and replied, “Are you not going to
try again?”</p>
