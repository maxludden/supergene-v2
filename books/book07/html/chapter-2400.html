<p>Blood continued to fountain out of the insect’s mouth, spilling
all over the place. It looked as if something was fighting its way
out.</p>
<p>“Dollar?” Dragon One and Dragon Eight asked together, squinting
at the figure that emerged. They could barely believe their eyes.
They wanted to scream, but their question came out as a
whisper.</p>
<p>He had been eaten by a deified creature, and yet he hadn’t been
killed. It was a miracle.</p>
<p>Han Sen finished pulling himself free and climbed to his feet.
He didn’t have any blood on him. He didn’t even look injured.
Dragon One stared at him in disbelief.</p>
<p>The weird insect shrieked and thrashed a little. It looked to be
in a great deal of pain. Instead of pursuing Han Sen, it just
drilled back into the earth and disappeared.</p>
<p>The green area power that had covered the sky suddenly
disappeared. Dragon Eight stared at the hole it left behind in
bewilderment.</p>
<p>“Dollar, what did you do?” Dragon Eight asked slowly, his voice
a little shaken.</p>
<p>“Nothing. I just thought I’d hurt it a little.” Han Sen paused
for a moment, then said, “Let’s go. Once it heals, I doubt we’ll be
able to escape again.”</p>
<p>Putting action to words, Han Sen left the ground and headed out
of Planet Dark Zone’s atmosphere.</p>
<p>He had wanted to kill the weird insect, but the creature was way
too strong. It had taken all of Han Sen’s strength to keep using
super spank on the weird insect’s core. Despite exhausting all of
his energy and approaching the time limit of his super god spirit
body, he was only able to leave a single crack across the core. He
hadn’t been able to actually break it.</p>
<p>Luckily, although the weird insect was strong, it wasn’t smart.
The crack in the creature’s core was small and not terribly
threatening, but the bug had chosen to run away even so. If it had
continued going after Han Sen, his super god spirit would have
given out eventually. He could have died.</p>
<p>Dragon One, Dragon Eight, Dia Robber, and the newly reassembled
Barr didn’t hesitate. They followed Han Sen away from Planet Dark
Zone.</p>
<p>The five of them didn’t speak, and they flew as fast as they
could until they were well beyond Planet Dark Zone. The weird
insect didn’t follow, which all of them were incredibly grateful
for.</p>
<p>“It looks like we’re all injured, and I need to go take a rest.
Let’s split up here,” Han Sen said, preparing to use his
self-universe cogwheel to leave the universal core area.</p>
<p>He had an idea about how to deal with the weird insect, but he
was too weak to do anything about it now. He would have to wait
until he was stronger.</p>
<p>Dragon One said, “Dollar, if you still want to work together, we
should set up a time and place to meet.”</p>
<p>“It will be hard to fit you into my schedule, but we can discuss
this when I find the time.” Han Sen didn’t want to set up a meeting
time because he was currently in the Extreme King. He wouldn’t
always be able to come here on a schedule.</p>
<p>“Should we have a way of contacting each other?” Dragon Eight
said.</p>
<p>In the geno universe, the stronger ones always earned respect.
Everyone wanted friends who were stronger than them.</p>
<p>Especially friends like Han Sen. He was a first-tier King
capable of fighting against a deified xenogeneic. Plus, he had
proven his ability to hurt many scary people. It almost seemed like
he was deified already. If someone could make friends with him,
they would. After all, it would be better to have him as an ally
than an enemy.</p>
<p>Dragon One and Dragon Eight wanted to maintain a good
relationship with him. Even if they couldn’t be friends, they
wanted Han Sen to think positively about them. Finding yourself at
odds with someone like him was never a good plan.</p>
<p>“So you are Dollar. You are even stronger than the stories say.
When would you like to fight me?” Barr asked, looking at Han
Sen.</p>
<p>Dia Robber laughed and said, “Barr, stop messing around. Today,
Dollar was the sole reason that we survived. If you don’t mind,
Dollar, please leave us a contact number. We would like to pay the
debt we now owe you.”</p>
<p>“It’s okay. I was just trying to save myself. You don’t need to
contact me again. We’ll meet again whenever luck decides,” Han Sen
said, then used his self-universe cogwheel. After a while, a giant
metal cogwheel door appeared, and Han Sen walked through it and
left.</p>
<p>Now that his self-universe cogwheel had been activated, it would
continue running on its own. Using it didn’t require any additional
energy.</p>
<p>Opening the door to the universal core hall did have some
requirements, though. Once Han Sen began the process of summoning
the door using his self-universe cogwheel, he couldn’t move it. If
he moved away from the door, he would destroy the connection. At
that point, he’d have to start the process all over.</p>
<p>In addition, summoning the door took a while. It would be
impossible to summon during combat, so the door couldn’t be used as
an escape route if Han Sen got into trouble.</p>
<p>Plus, when he returned to the core area, he would end up exactly
where he had left the previous time. He wouldn’t just randomly
teleport to some other location in the core area.</p>
<p>“Brother Dragon One, who is this Dollar? Can you tell me?” Dia
Robber looked at Dragon One.</p>
<p>Dragon One shook his head. “We met him by chance, and we worked
together twice. We don’t know much about him. No more than you guys
do.”</p>
<p>“I have never heard of a race called ‘human’ before. How could
they have produced an elite like that? It is confusing.” Dia Robber
asked, his expression mystified.</p>
<p>“I am afraid that because of Dollar, humans might become famous
across the universe. We don’t know if there are any other strong
humans. If he’s the only one with such strength, like Kong Fei was,
he would still be alone. He cannot change the world, in that case,”
Dragon One answered.</p>
<p>The four of them lost themselves in deep thought. None of them
said anything. And eventually, they all used their self-universe
cogwheels to leave the universal core hall.</p>
<p>After Dia Robber returned to the Destroyed, he went looking for
other Destroyed Kings. He asked the ones he could find to stay in
the vicinity of Planet Dark Zone. They were to wait inside the core
area, and if Dollar re-appeared, they would contact Dia Robber at
once.</p>
<p>Dollarcidentally, when Dragon One returned to the Dragon, he did
exactly the same thing. Clearly, they were waiting for Han Sen to
return to the core area, too.</p>
<p>Han Sen came out of the universal core hall back in Underwater
Town. Bao’er was lying on his bed, and she rubbed her eyes when she
heard movement. Seeing that it was Han Sen, she leaped into his
arms.</p>
<p>“Dad? Where were you? Why didn’t you take me?” Bao’er lifted her
lips.</p>
<p>“I reached King class a few days ago. I got pulled into the core
area.” Han Sen looked at Bao’er and asked, “Can you and the little
bird enter the core area?”</p>
<p>“Core area? What is that?” Bao’er asked in confusion.</p>
<p>If Bao’er did not know, then she probably couldn’t join him. And
the little red bird was deified, so it couldn’t go in with him,
either. Otherwise, Han Sen could use the little red bird to kill
the weird insect.</p>
<p>Han Sen had used his super god spirit mode for too long, and his
body was exhausted. He felt very powerless and sore. Han Sen didn’t
plan on returning to the core area anytime soon. He rested for a
few days and ate some of the core xenogeneic genes each day. His
number of King genes kept increasing.</p>
<p>His body had almost recovered when the day came for him to enter
Destiny’s Tower. He didn’t want to be late, and so he arrived at
the site an hour early.</p>
<p>The Extreme King were quite effective. They had four elites on
standby to open the door of Destiny’s Tower for Han Sen and let him
in.</p>
