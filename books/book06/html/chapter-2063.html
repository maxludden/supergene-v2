<h2>Blood Dragon’s Anger</h2>
<h3>Chapter 2063</h3>

<p>Han Sen did not care. He kept on swinging knife airs at his foe.
Most of them failed, but many were able to come close to the basic
shape that he needed. It was like a plucked string, vibrating to
produce tones that could break the sky.</p>
<p>Dragon Nine’s Evilbreaker Blood Dragon Light was unable to touch
Han Sen, and it made him furrow his brows in frustration. The Blood
Dragon Light flowed brighter, and the light in his wings became
solid. It was like a fog of blood obscuring the sky.</p>
<p>Red scales appeared all across Dragon Nine’s body, and his hands
produced red Dragon talons. A red mist rose from his horns, and his
entire body grew to twice its original size. He was four meters
tall now.</p>
<p>The scary presence he once carried only grew scarier. It was
like an ocean wave, endlessly building in size.</p>
<p>Han Sen looked at Dragon Nine. The Blood Feather Knife was still
busy producing knife silks. Dragon Nine didn’t bother dodging. He
allowed the silk to fall upon him, as the light would break them
before they could even land atop his scales.</p>
<p>“Your xenogeneic draconic body is really nice,” Han Sen said
politely.</p>
<p>Dragon Nine snarled, “A xenogeneic dragon body is nothing to one
of the Dragon. My Blood Dragon body is different, however. Even if
you have Break Space Flash, I am now something you cannot hope to
escape.”</p>
<p>“I would like to know what the difference is.” Han Sen kept
talking as he repeatedly swung his knife.</p>
<p>He was starting to grasp a subtle sense of what he needed to do.
The knife silks that were made of both a soft and strong power were
manifesting with a better success rate. All he had to do now was to
concentrate what he was coming to grips with, and channel what he
needed to learn from Dragon Nine to make them as tough as the
Dragon Lights.</p>
<p>Dragon Nine did not respond. He lifted his Dragon lance with two
hands. His Evilbreaker Blood Dragon Light was spreading across the
weapon, and the lance reacted as if it was alive. It became a scary
Blood Dragon, and it roared in Dragon Nine’s hands. Its glow
intensified.</p>
<p>Han Sen kept swinging. The knife silks cut across Dragon Nine’s
body repeatedly, but the attacks did nothing.</p>
<p>“Old Nine is really mad. He cast Blood Dragon’s Anger!” Dragon
Seven said with a smile.</p>
<p>Dragon Fifteen said, “If this is all he needs to kill Han Sen,
he should just do it. What’s the point in talking?”</p>
<p>Han Sen looked glum. He knew Dragon Nine’s Lance was strong, and
so he started moving his Blood Feather Knife faster.</p>
<p>“Han Sen, accept my Blood Dragon’s Anger!” The power in Dragon
Nine’s body reached the max. His red dragon wings flapped, and the
lance he held looked like a ravenous monster. The Dragon was a
manifestation of light, and it held the power to destroy the world.
It appeared in front of Han Sen, and it was going to consume
him.</p>
<p>Han Sen flapped his red dragon wings and teleported one hundred
meters away. This was the furthest away he could teleport with
Break Space Flash.</p>
<p>But when Han Sen moved, something went awry. The Blood Dragon’s
body exploded, and the Dragon Light went off like a firework.</p>
<p>The concentrated lancelight was perfectly pure, and it expanded
to a radius of one mile. And it was not like an arrow that, once
fired, became nothing.</p>
<p>The Dragon Light exploded like a hail of needles. No matter
which way Han Sen moved, he’d be unable to dodge it.</p>
<p>The Dragon Light wasn’t random or uncontrolled. If one touched
Han Sen, the other streams of light would turn to riddle him with
numerous strikes.</p>
<p>Han Sen’s body would be turned into a pincushion, and the Dragon
Light would explode from inside him. Not even a Duke elite could
escape a power as wretched as that.</p>
<p>Break Space Flash’s max distance was a hundred meters. Han Sen
couldn’t use it to get far enough away to escape the Blood Dragon’s
Anger’s area of effect.</p>
<p>“If I cannot dodge, then there is no point trying.” Han Sen
gripped his Blood Feather Knife and kept swinging at the Dragon
Light. He did not use Under the Sky. Now, he was using Teeth
Knife.</p>
<p>Fang!</p>
<p>The purple knife air became a toxic fang headed towards the
Dragon Light. The purple knife air struck the Dragon Light and made
a katcha sound.</p>
<p>Teeth Knife’s purple mist was broken through and dispersed. A
second later, the Dragon Light had destroyed it, and the light kept
moving towards Han Sen.</p>
<p>Han Sen retreated and continued using his Blood Feather Knife.
He was still determined to use Tusk, and so two purple teeth marks
appeared on the Dragon Light next. It made a scary, cracking noise
once again.</p>
<p>The Teeth power was shattered, but it shattered more slowly this
time. It made the Blood Dragon’s Anger far slower, and it gave Han
Sen enough time to get out of the Blood Dragon’s Anger’s area of
effect.</p>
<p>But the Blood Dragon’s Anger was like something alive. The
Dragon Light became a red dragon that sought to consume Han Sen.
When Han Sen evaded it, it exploded.</p>
<p>“Let me see how many times you can teleport.” Dragon Nine coldly
looked at the Blood Dragon’s Anger covering Han Sen.</p>
<p>Han Sen used Teeth powers, but this time, they were more solid
than before. A squeaking noise was made when the two collided, and
then the Teeth powers shattered.</p>
<p>Dragon Seven was shocked. “His Teeth powers now seem
different!”</p>
<p>“What’s the difference? He copied Brother Nine’s concentrated
powers. No matter how hard he tries, though, he won’t get anything
half as good as Brother Nine’s Blood Dragon Light.” Dragon Fifteen
looked haughtily as Han Sen.</p>
<p>Things weren’t as simple as he initially believed them to be,
however. When Han Sen used Teeth powers the fourth time, the purple
Fang struck, it was still broken by the Blood Dragon’s Anger.
However, it also managed to chip off a bit of the Dragon Light.</p>
<p>Han Sen wanted to use soft and strong powers on the knife silks,
but knife silks were merely thin strings. They were worse than the
Dragon Light, when compared side by side.</p>
<p>The results were different when Han Sen tried to use that
concentrated power on Teeth Knife instead. The strong and soft
powers melded well with the Teeth powers. When it was concentrated,
the sharp power was no worse than what the Dragon Light could
achieve.</p>
<p>After adding the soft elements, the Teeth power became both soft
and tough. It was not easy to break when it was hit.</p>
<p>If it was too tough, it’d break. If it was too soft, it’d bend.
Teeth powers were able to benefit well from both aspects. While
they were concentrated, his tearing power became stronger.</p>
<p>Katcha! Katcha!</p>
<p>Toxic Teeth and Dragon Lights came to collide against each other
in the air. In the beginning, Han Sen’s Teeth power was at a
disadvantage, and it kept being broken.</p>
<p>But as Han Sen kept swinging, Teeth Knife gradually improved.
After ten slashes, he could fight the Blood Dragon’s Dragon
Light.</p>
<p>The purple smoke broke, and a red light went flying. Teeth and a
Dragon were fighting in the air. No one could tell who had an
advantage between the two.</p>
