<p>“Even if I know he is the red-robed child, it will be pointless
if I cannot find a way to control it. Even Mister Yin was unable to
control it. So, that means I will have to ask the Grandmaster. But
the Grandmaster went to the big barren systems, so I do not think
he will be back anytime soon.” Bai Wanjie sighed. He quickly
thought of someone else.</p>
<p>“I need to get Mister White from the Winter Garden.” Bai Wanjie
summoned a servant and gave him a pass. He told him, “Be polite to
Mister White. Do not offend him.”</p>
<p>The servant accepted the pass and departed. Bai Wanjie thought,
Mister White has a lot of knowledge. Before he was deified, he had
already accomplished many shocking things. After becoming deified,
he has only become even better. With his weird powers, we might
stand a chance.</p>
<p>“Greetings, Mister Crown Prince.” Mister White went to the crown
prince’s manor and bowed before Bai Wanjie.</p>
<p>“There is no need for such modesty.” Bai Wanjie lifted Mister
White and said, “Today, I have asked you to come here because there
is something you must understand. I hope you will be able to help
me.”</p>
<p>“Please tell me what it is, Mister Crown Prince, ” Mister White
gently said. “If I know how to fix what bothers you, it will be my
pleasure to do just that.”</p>
<p>Bai Wanjie told him about Mister Yin using Ghost Head Fall on
Han Sen and how he ended up dying, but he did not tell him about
Han Sen’s story or where he had come from.</p>
<p>After hearing this, Mister White thought for a moment. He soon
said, “I will need to take a look at the xenogeneic first. Only
then can I examine it and give you the accurate answer you seek,
Mister Crown Prince.”</p>
<p>“Please do that.” Bai Wanjie took Mister White over to the
supergravity cabin that contained Han Sen.</p>
<p>Han Sen saw Bai Wanjie had brought Mister White with him. When
he did, he suddenly felt happy. Yet, he did not dare show that
happiness on his face. He looked at Bai Wanjie and gave him a look
of scornful mocking.</p>
<p>“That is the xenogeneic, Mister White.” Bai Wanjie did not care.
He gestured toward Mister White.</p>
<p>Mister White walked in front of Han Sen and checked him out. He
reached a hand out to touch Han Sen’s head. On the other hand, he
was counting his fingers as if he was calculating something.</p>
<p>Han Sen’s face was full of disdain. His heart was jumping, but
he did not seek to give him any hints in case Bai Wanjie saw
it.</p>
<p>Even if Bai Wanjie didn’t see it, there were cameras. If Bai
Wanjie went to look at the cameras, he would notice something. That
would only lead to harm upon Mister White.</p>
<p>Han Sen thought, With Mister White’s power, he must be able to
recognize me.</p>
<p>Mister White did not seem to show any sign of knowing that. His
face did not change. He acted as if Han Sen was a total stranger.
He touched every inch of Han Sen’s body and returned to Bai
Wanjie.</p>
<p>After all that time, however, Han Sen did not see any changes in
Mister White’s eyes.</p>
<p>Did Mister White not recognize me? Han Sen felt a bit sad about
that, but he could not hint at him in any way.</p>
<p>“Did you find out anything?” Bai Wanjie asked.</p>
<p>Mister White looked at Han Sen before replying to Bai Wanjie.
“We should talk about it when we’re out of here.”</p>
<p>Upon hearing that, Han Sen felt a chill. Did Mister White
recognize me?</p>
<p>Bai Wanjie understood and gestured for them to exit. He and
Mister White left the supergravity cabin.</p>
<p>He took Mister White to a lobby. After they sat down, Bai Wanjie
said, “We can talk in here. You can tell me anything.”</p>
<p>Mister White did not reply. It seemed as if he was trying to
find a way to compose what he wished to say. A while later, he
said, “From what I have been able to tell, Mister Yin should not
have used Ghost Head Fall on him. Mister Yin had just become a
transmutation class. Even if he was larvae class or even butterfly
class, using Ghost Head Fall would have likely resulted in his
death.”</p>
<p>Bai Wanjie was surprised, so he asked, “Oh, why is that?”</p>
<p>“If I have guessed correctly, that xenogeneic came from the
Space Garden,” Mister White slowly said. “Is that right?”</p>
<p>“How did you know where it came from?” Bai Wanjie was shocked.
He had not told Mister White where Han Sen had come from, yet
Mister White had been able to guess it. That was unbelievable.</p>
<p>Mister White quietly said, “I am good at predicting. It is not
hard to see where it came from.”</p>
<p>“You really are a genius, but what is that supposed to mean?”
Bai Wanjie now believed Mister White.</p>
<p>“From what I have seen, the Space Garden is a plant xenogeneic
that is true god class,” Mister White replied. “Its power is very
unique. Even if a true god-class elite tried to, it may not enter
the Space Garden.”</p>
<p>Bai Wanjie saw that Mister White was able to tell the secrets of
the place. Thus, he believed him even more.</p>
<p>The secrets of the Space Garden being a true god xenogeneic was
not something many people knew. He had only heard the secret from
Bai King once before.</p>
<p>Mister White was from a small race that was raised by the
Extreme King, yet he knew this secret. Bai Wanjie believed Mister
White even more.</p>
<p>“Earlier, I calculated this xenogeneic’s identity. If I have
guessed correctly, he is the son of the Space Garden. When the
Space Garden raised him, he earned many special abilities. So, he
is not just a born-deified. He has two talents. He is a special
child that can conquer the universe.”</p>
<p>Mister White paused and said, “I believe that something strange
must have happened in the Space Garden that made many creatures
die. That is what must have happened when he was born. When this
special child was born, its lifeforce and genes were scarier than
ordinary born-deifieds. He is almost immortal. Other people might
be able to kill it, but taking its mind is an impossible task.”</p>
<p>“If that is true, how can I control him?” Bai Wanjie knew Mister
White hadn’t gone to the Space Garden, but he spoke like he had
been. He had not missed a single part, which made him very
confused.</p>
<p>“With my power, I do not think I can help you,” Mister White
said. “Why don’t you find the Grandmaster to help? With his power,
I am sure you can tame it.”</p>
<p>“The Grandmaster is out on business, and I am afraid he will not
be back soon.” Bai Wanjie could see there was more for Mister White
to say, so he asked, “Mister White, is there no other way?”</p>
<p>“It is not that there is not another way, but it would be very
troublesome,” Mister White said.</p>
<p>“Please tell me, Mister White,” Bai Wanjie said with glee.</p>
<p>“If you want to control this child, perhaps you can go and make
use of the Extreme King’s Overbearing Eye,” Mister White slowly
said.</p>
