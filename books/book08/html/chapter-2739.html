<h2>Weird Scene</h2>
<h3>Chapter 2739</h3>
<figure><img src="../Images/gem.gif" alt="gem" id="gem" width="120"

<p>The pictures were, admittedly, strange. Han Sen and the two
women passed through many restrictions to get there, but if they
hadn’t, Han Sen would have thought that these drawings had been
created by some renowned abstract painter or graffiti artist rather
than by an ancient elite.</p>
<p>When they arrived at the Ancient Wall, many of the Very High
were at the wall already. Some were sitting, some were standing,
some were staring at the wall, and some had their heads lowered in
contemplation. It seemed as if they were all trying to feel
something from the paintings on the wall.</p>
<p>Some of the Very High who were present were very scary
individuals, too. Even among their powerful race, they were
probably considered top-class elites.</p>
<p>Han Sen started to say something, but Exquisite gestured for him
to remain silent. She gravely placed a finger over her lips, then
motioned for him to observe the painting.</p>
<p>When Han Sen saw how Exquisite and Li Keer were carefully
watching the Very High around them, he realized that the two women
must be trying not to disturb their prestigious elders. They were
being very careful not to do anything that might disturb the other
people at the wall or disrupt their concentration.</p>
<p>Han Sen didn’t say anything. He just moved to examine the
drawings on the wall. Exquisite and Li Keer stayed beside him,
looking closely at the drawings as well.</p>
<p>As they tried to understand the drawings, they also paid
attention to what Han Sen was thinking. Being able to access Han
Sen’s perspective and knowledge meant they could learn much
more.</p>
<p>But it wasn’t as if they were taking advantage of Han Sen. After
all, had he not become a silkworm of the Very High, he would never
have been able to see the drawings on this wall in the first
place.</p>
<p>The whole mountain was covered in drawings, which meant that
there was an unimaginable amount to take in. Han Sen wanted to find
the very beginning. Once he found the starting point, he could
follow the drawings as they progressed.</p>
<p>But after searching for a while, he was unable to find where the
drawing had begun.</p>
<p>The weird artwork was something Han Sen couldn’t understand in
the least. Many abstract images seemed to have been melded together
into a single fluid mural, which had no beginning and no end. It
was hard to tell what it could all mean. If the drawings hadn’t
been so incredibly smooth and stunning, Han Sen would have thought
that it was the random graffiti of a child.</p>
<p>Exquisite could feel what Han Sen was thinking. She lowered her
voice and whispered to Han Sen, “No one knows where this painting
starts, and no one knows what the painting means. You should start
by trying to understand it through the scratches.”</p>
<p>Han Sen nodded without responding. He couldn’t see any obvious
clues, so he did what Exquisite had suggested. He focused on the
scratch marks visible in the stone.</p>
<p>Han Sen’s mind wasn’t any worse than that of an ordinary deified
elite. After looking over the drawing for a while, Han Sen realized
that it had been drawn with a person’s fingers. The mind that
resided inside the scratch marks wasn’t hostile, either. These
weren’t the gashes of weaponry, but neither were they elegant like
writing done with a pen. It was a very strange thing to see.</p>
<p>“This should be a finger mind,” Han Sen guessed. He couldn’t be
entirely sure, though.</p>
<p>Although he wasn’t sure what kind of mind this was, it wasn’t
hard to tell that the person who made the entire drawing had a
powerful consciousness. Han Sen’s mind was powerful in its own
right, but compared to the mind that had created these marks, his
was simple and low-level.</p>
<p>Han Sen wasn’t in a rush to understand the mind that resided
within the marks. He followed a trail across the mountain. First,
he wanted to take-in the drawing on a larger scale. After that, he
would step closer and examine each individual drawing in
detail.</p>
<p>But no matter how hard he tried to see and understand, he
couldn’t get the gist of any painting or drawing. He couldn’t even
glean a clue. He had to start from the scratch marks again.</p>
<p>“The mind in the carving was left behind by the Very High who
used his powers to draw. I think that the messages left behind by
the drawing and the scratch marks themselves are different.
Revealing the secrets of the painting wouldn’t help me understand
the mind carved into the rock. But then again, no one expects me to
reveal the secrets of the painting. If I can understand the meaning
of the scratches, then this entire venture will be worthwhile.” Han
Sen grew calm and focused on trying to understand the meaning of
the lines.</p>
<p>The marks gave Han Sen the impression of drifting clouds, but as
his understanding of the marks deepened, it made him think of an
unstoppable force. It gave him the desire to delve deeper into the
depths of his own emotions.</p>
<p>It was the feeling of someone who loved reading books, but then
they discovered the most spell-binding novel in existence. Han Sen
was drawn to it, and he didn’t want to tear himself away from the
tale for a single second. He just wanted to keep reading and find
out what happened next.</p>
<p>The second impression he gleaned was the word “strange.” Every
mind tended to have a theme. In Han Sen’s Under the Sky, for
example, the theme was that everything in the universe was just a
chess piece.</p>
<p>But the mind in this painting was unique. If you described an
ordinary person’s mind, you could say it was like a tree, a
mountain, or a river. But if those things represented ordinary
minds, then the mind of this painting would be like a scroll that
was 10,000 miles long.</p>
<p>Every line and every curve had a different mind. One section
could be a mountain or a body of water. Another part might be a
cloud or a speck of soil, or a pavilion or a building. A single
curve of the drawing could be a flower, a bird, a bug, or a fish.
The changing of the minds drew the observer in further and further,
leaving them unable to stop. With a single step, Han Sen could
witness three different scenes. Every line and every turn filled
him with amazing thoughts. It left him unable to guess what the
next scene might be.</p>
<p>“No wonder Exquisite said any creature that visited the Ancient
Wall would receive a boost to their mind. The mind on this wall
seems to encompass everything. Any creature that practiced any
power or element could find a mind there that matched well with
their geno arts.” Although Han Sen was looking at it with his own
eyes, it was rather difficult to believe.</p>
<p>Han Sen wondered what sort of genius this Very High elder must
have been to be capable of drawing a painting like this on his
own.</p>
<p>If the Very High hadn’t confirmed that the Ancient Wall’s
drawings were done by one person, Han Sen would have thought that
this drawing was the work of many people. How could one person be
the master of so many minds? It didn’t make sense.</p>
<p>Even though Han Sen had a voracious intellect and an impressive
ability to learn, he could only walk one path. He couldn’t learn
everything there was to be learned in the universe.</p>
<p>“If this was drawn by one person, then that Very High elder’s
mind is very impressive. He must have been the smartest person in
the whole universe,” Han Sen murmured as he examined the
drawings.</p>
<p>Han Sen continued working his way through the drawings, one by
one. Although he couldn’t learn all of it, just feeling all those
kinds of minds was good for expanding his own knowledge. It was
helping him develop new perspectives.</p>
<p>Han Sen was continuing his observations when he was delivered a
shock. Goosebumps flared across his skin at the sensation. This
mind was simply too twisted and weird. As he explored, Han Sen had
felt too much of the mind and realized that it was too complicated.
He was sinking into it, which shook his faith to the core.</p>
<p>It was like a university student who had just graduated.
Countless large companies sent invitations to the graduate. One of
them said, “Come to my company and be a lawyer. Being a lawyer has
all sorts of benefits. You will earn a lot of money.” Another
company said, “Come to be a doctor in my company. Being a doctor
can make you incredibly famous, and your reputation will grow by
leaps and bounds.”</p>
<p>Everyone said they were the best, and all of them seemed
generous and attractive. A new graduate, being pulled in so many
different directions, could quickly lose track of themselves.</p>
